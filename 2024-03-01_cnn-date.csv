The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.\n\nTuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.\n\nThis is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.\n\nNow, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.\n\nRead more about why Michigan's primary is key."", 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 29, 0, 0)}, {'_id': ObjectId('65e548a695448c55d6e3da6e'), 'title': 'Supreme Court to decide Trump immunity claim', 'top_image': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231228230243-02-trump-file-122823.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'images': ['https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8401a613-3b13-41ea-aedd-d1866f8030e6.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/858e3c99-ed4f-4af1-a193-60d261e9f482.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cf2e3bf3-16e6-429d-b201-7beadbb9cd2c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240227145233-rafah-022724.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/q_auto', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/q_auto', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/6840e0f3-bfea-4380-aa5b-7071eb279d3c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2cdeadc1-38d2-4968-b8e2-537cf58130a8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230111171322-elise-hammond.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c79f8728-a2b9-41a2-bf2d-6d84fe9a168b.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ebe9eba5-574e-4988-bd0d-f98842917936.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231228230243-02-trump-file-122823.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b4f39436-ae2b-44b9-8c2c-ff19511dc7eb.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230422192329-biden-trump-split-042223.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/q_auto'], 'videos': [], 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-legal-cases-court-02-28-24/index.html', 'date': '2024-02-29', 'short_description': 'Supreme Court to decide Trump immunity claim  CNN', 'text': 'Former President Donald Trump attends a campaign event ahead of the Republican presidential primary election in North Charleston, South Carolina, on February 14. Sam Wolfe/Reuters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.\n\n“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”\n\nTrump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.\n\nTrump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.\n\nIf the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.\n\nIf the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.', 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 29, 0, 0)}, {'_id': ObjectId('65e548a695448c55d6e3da6b'), 'title': 'Live updates: Biden, Trump visit US-Mexico border in reelection effort', 'top_image': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-super-tease.jpg', 'images': ['https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-super-tease.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/104974ff-1d04-4bed-b48e-2d33ed98eaea.JPG', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/616a16c0-1f27-4a41-ab06-72e27d3ab0ea.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/4c3c4c67-2835-4e83-9ed3-48d31b8624c5.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/52ce9c6c-fc5d-4bfc-8c9b-4b53ef474c4f.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/a910dd82-f3ae-4536-88de-c5b8df596e04.JPG', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/ac67b44c-a1d0-4c80-8fef-a877c27b75c5.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/1a2f1f05-0e2e-4fd8-af06-c020b66c3f40.jpg'], 'videos': [], 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-biden-border-election-news-02-29-24/index.html', 'date': '2024-02-29', 'short_description': 'Live updates: Biden, Trump visit US-Mexico border in reelection effort  CNN', 'text': ""Former President Donald Trump visits the US-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas, as seen from Piedras Negras, Mexico, on February 29.

Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.\n\nThe former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.\n\n“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.\n\nThe former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.\n\nTrump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border."", 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 29, 0, 0)}, {'_id': ObjectId('65e548a695448c55d6e3da6f'), 'title': 'Live updates: Hunter Biden sits in on closed-door deposition with House Oversight and Judiciary committee', 'top_image': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240110110638-04-hunter-biden-capitol-hill-01-10-2024-super-tease.jpg', 'images': ['https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/340e63d9-3106-4719-8931-a4ecfdbe9ed8.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/f3cdb473-8238-4f7d-a546-b96aa46cd3e9.JPG', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/e5088872-d50f-41fb-95ca-0268651e3c76.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/be4a5eac-01ca-478a-91fe-b88561d9138c.JPG', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/b9f810a7-5e94-4bff-b62e-8e359d264baf.JPG', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240110110638-04-hunter-biden-capitol-hill-01-10-2024-super-tease.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/22a74ef9-32e7-4b20-b0a9-e37e160da4d9.jpg'], 'videos': [], 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/hunter-biden-deposition-02-28-24/index.html', 'date': '2024-02-29', 'short_description': ""Hunter Biden's closed-door deposition with GOP-led House committees: Live updates  CNN"", 'text': ""Democrats leaving Hunter Biden’s deposition said the president’s son raised the “double standard” of Republicans investigating his business dealings but turning a blind eye to members of the Trump family like Jared Kushner, whose company received a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia after leaving the Trump White House.\n\n“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.

The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.', 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 3, 1, 0, 0)}, {'_id': ObjectId('65e548a695448c55d6e3da6c'), 'title': 'Live updates: House passes short-term funding bill to avoid partial shutdown', 'top_image': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-super-tease.jpg', 'images': ['https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/75a002b4-fd2a-4814-94fd-d4c4133a9114.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/c6bf5fc4-ebe7-4e65-89e0-ee511fbe4e8f.JPG', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-super-tease.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/c7990080-f823-4e5e-afbd-954ddf2be89b.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/40833a77-3c82-47b7-93a8-c629a18c44ae.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/1011a401-8005-4fc4-aac8-75b587b21304.jpg'], 'videos': [], 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/government-shutdown-deadline-02-29-24/index.html', 'date': '2024-03-01', 'short_description': 'The latest on funding negotiations as shutdown deadline looms  CNN', 'text': 'House Republicans expressed frustration Thursday after a short-term bill to fund the government ahead of a Friday deadline passed the House with the help of Democrats after House Speaker Mike Johnson cut a deal with the White House and Senate on government funding.\n\nRep.

Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nDonald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.\n\nThe race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.\n\nTrump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.\n\nWhere does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.\n\nNikki Haley arrives to speaks to supporters after the South Carolina presidential primary on Saturday in Charleston. Chris Carlson/AP\n\nA big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016.

The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US.

Tuesday will tell.\n\nA fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.\n\nTests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.\n\nRead more about what to look out for ahead of the Michigan presidential primaries."", 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 28, 0, 0)}, {'_id': ObjectId('65e548a695448c55d6e3da70'), 'title': 'Live updates: Supreme Court bump stocks ban oral arguments', 'top_image': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227162414-bump-stocks-file-super-tease.jpg', 'images': ['https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/548a76fc-f087-4144-a65f-39cb09e5a485.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/458b0a2f-095d-4094-8c01-fe259b958715.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227162414-bump-stocks-file-super-tease.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/aa3bf442-d45a-48e3-a41e-c4d19c86a0cb.jpg'], 'videos': [], 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/supreme-court-bump-stocks-ban/index.html', 'date': '2024-02-28', 'short_description': 'Live updates: Supreme Court bump stocks ban oral arguments  CNN', 'text': 'Several conservative Supreme Court justices indicated Wednesday they are concerned with the federal ban on bump stocks, a device that allows semi-automatic weapons to fire more like a machine gun.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said he was worried about Americans being prosecuted under a ban they aren\'t aware of.

In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.\n\nThe White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.\n\nA cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.\n\nWhen the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional details on Biden\'s physical.', 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 28, 0, 0)}, {'_id': ObjectId('65e548a695448c55d6e3da7f'), 'title': 'Biden’s political operation has expanded its financial advantage over Trump’s campaign', 'top_image': 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240226163121-01-early-voting-michigan-021724-super-tease.jpg', 'images': ['https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240112215135-fani-willis-wade-august-14-2023-small-11.jpeg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/f4ec115c-9a2c-4ce8-bc33-3cc0e247aab2.png', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/e39e9c2f-668b-4c05-b177-a5c1da774633.JPG', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240226163121-01-early-voting-michigan-021724-small-11.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/22fc2cbc-0d58-4385-a5f3-95efc8e4dfba.JPG', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/8150921f-df52-4948-8c38-254dba346ad1.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240226163121-01-early-voting-michigan-021724-super-tease.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/533d6455-9f9d-4111-b622-c1b0a1a703e4.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/593ee239-07d6-4169-a044-be711ea6a9d6.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/b77d4bf7-407b-4696-80df-c1cebf61970a.JPG', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240224163454-ukraine-trench-soldier-small-11.jpg', 'https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/879df60a-a190-4423-9b25-bee84933f27c.jpg'], 'videos': [], 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/michigan-primary-02-27-24/h_c9c6db3cd366b0d1a4c6bb788d0f01aa', 'date': '2024-02-28', 'short_description': 'Live updates: Michigan presidential primary election  CNN', 'text': ""A man votes in Detroit on Tuesday. Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.\n\nHere’s what to watch for in Michigan:\n\nThe first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.\n\nA fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.\n\nTests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.\n\nRead more about what to

Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.\n\nEngoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.\n\n“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the decision:\n\nThe biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.\n\nEngoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified.

Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.\n\nBradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.\n\n“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.', 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 16, 0, 0)}]"

He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.\n\nThe vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.\n\nThis comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.\n\nHouse Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.\n\nThe impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.\n\nWhat happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vote:"", 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 13, 0, 0)}]"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP\n\nIn an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.\n\n“It\'s interesting that we\'re here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: \'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,\'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.\n\n“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don\'t need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don\'t need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who\'s ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”\n\nThe defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it\'s critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.\n\nIn court filings, defendant Mike Roman\'s team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.\n\nWillis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.', 'publisher': {'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}, 'convertedDate': datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 15, 0, 0)}, {'_id': ObjectId('65e548a695448c55d6e3da86'), 'title': 'Polls are closing in New York’s 3rd Congressional District.
