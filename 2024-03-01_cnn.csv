President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott.

Haley’s campaign manager Betsy Ankney told CNN that Haley will travel to Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine and Vermont over the course of the next 10 days.

Haley’s schedule shows where the campaign sees fertile ground, mostly states in the northeast and in the western part of the country.

Massachusetts and Vermont have a winner-take-all rule if one candidate clinches more than 50% of the vote, and the campaign thinks that hitting that goal could be possible for Haley, one campaign official said.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Haley’s schedule shows where the campaign sees fertile ground, mostly states in the northeast and in the western part of the country.

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order.

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the House Freedom Caucus and a deficit hawk, criticized the Speaker over his handling of the issue and lamented that he believes something has to change in Washington.

“It's not where we need to be to actually fundamentally change the town. We have a trillion dollars of interest in 2026, guys. I mean, I don't know what to tell you. Something's got to stop. Something's got to change,"" he said.

Rep. Nancy Mace, who was one of the eight lawmakers who voted to strip former Speaker Kevin McCarthy of the gavel, defended her vote even after Johnson reached a deal not too different from what ultimately led to the former Speaker’s ouster.

“He inherited a lot of Kevin McCarthy's bad deals, number one, so I don't fault him for that. But number two, I'm gonna say the same thing I've always said, Republicans and Democrats alike are spending too damn much, period,” she told CNN’s Manu Raju.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Biden: 87

Unallocated: 30

Total pledged delegates won to date:

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Haley’s schedule shows where the campaign sees fertile ground, mostly states in the northeast and in the western part of the country.

Massachusetts and Vermont have a winner-take-all rule if one candidate clinches more than 50% of the vote, and the campaign thinks that hitting that goal could be possible for Haley, one campaign official said.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

George Santos.

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close. Mail and early in-person votes will be reported first.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Haley’s schedule shows where the campaign sees fertile ground, mostly states in the northeast and in the western part of the country.

Massachusetts and Vermont have a winner-take-all rule if one candidate clinches more than 50% of the vote, and the campaign thinks that hitting that goal could be possible for Haley, one campaign official said.

Some Haley donors told CNN that they still plan to throw their support behind her, despite her South Carolina loss. But one donor said that if she does not perform well on Super Tuesday, it ""will put a significant dent in her armor.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he was worried about Americans being prosecuted under a ban they aren't aware of. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that while she was ""intuitively"" concerned about the bump stock devices, she questioned why the issue wouldn't be better handled by Congress.

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

""The entire point of this device,"" Justice Elena Kagan said, is that the shooter pushes forward on the weapon while shooting and ""a torrent of bullets shoot out.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

George Santos.

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close. Mail and early in-person votes will be reported first.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer.

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he was worried about Americans being prosecuted under a ban they aren't aware of. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that while she was ""intuitively"" concerned about the bump stock devices, she questioned why the issue wouldn't be better handled by Congress.

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

""The entire point of this device,"" Justice Elena Kagan said, is that the shooter pushes forward on the weapon while shooting and ""a torrent of bullets shoot out.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Haley’s schedule shows where the campaign sees fertile ground, mostly states in the northeast and in the western part of the country.

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

Nikki Haley arrives to speaks to supporters after the South Carolina presidential primary on Saturday in Charleston. Chris Carlson/AP

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the House Freedom Caucus and a deficit hawk, criticized the Speaker over his handling of the issue and lamented that he believes something has to change in Washington.

Rep. Nancy Mace, who was one of the eight lawmakers who voted to strip former Speaker Kevin McCarthy of the gavel, defended her vote even after Johnson reached a deal not too different from what ultimately led to the former Speaker’s ouster.

“He inherited a lot of Kevin McCarthy's bad deals, number one, so I don't fault him for that. But number two, I'm gonna say the same thing I've always said, Republicans and Democrats alike are spending too damn much, period,” she told CNN’s Manu Raju.

When pressed by CNN on what policy wins she believes they have achieved following McCarthy's ouster, she pointed to greater transparency from Johnson.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Haley’s schedule shows where the campaign sees fertile ground, mostly states in the northeast and in the western part of the country.

Massachusetts and Vermont have a winner-take-all rule if one candidate clinches more than 50% of the vote, and the campaign thinks that hitting that goal could be possible for Haley, one campaign official said.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close. Mail and early in-person votes will be reported first.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

George Santos.

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close. Mail and early in-person votes will be reported first.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“It's not where we need to be to actually fundamentally change the town. We have a trillion dollars of interest in 2026, guys. I mean, I don't know what to tell you. Something's got to stop. Something's got to change,"" he said.

“He inherited a lot of Kevin McCarthy's bad deals, number one, so I don't fault him for that. But number two, I'm gonna say the same thing I've always said, Republicans and Democrats alike are spending too damn much, period,” she told CNN’s Manu Raju.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection.

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Under questioning from Donald Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, Bradley said he represented Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the Georgia election subversion case, between 2018 and mid-2022.

During that time, Bradley said, he had one conversation with Wade in their shared law office about the relationship.

“You’re testifying under oath that you had one conversation about a relationship between Mr. Wade and Miss Willis?” Sadow asked. “Is that correct?”

“I don’t recall having any other conversation with Mr. Wade about him and Ms. Willis,” Bradley responded.

“Is it your testimony then, that you don’t remember any other conversation or there wasn’t any other conversation besides the one?” Sadow asked.

Bradley said he believed that “it was the one” but that he did not determinately remember whether there were others.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he was worried about Americans being prosecuted under a ban they aren't aware of. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that while she was ""intuitively"" concerned about the bump stock devices, she questioned why the issue wouldn't be better handled by Congress.

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

""The entire point of this device,"" Justice Elena Kagan said, is that the shooter pushes forward on the weapon while shooting and ""a torrent of bullets shoot out.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he was worried about Americans being prosecuted under a ban they aren't aware of. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that while she was ""intuitively"" concerned about the bump stock devices, she questioned why the issue wouldn't be better handled by Congress.

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

""The entire point of this device,"" Justice Elena Kagan said, is that the shooter pushes forward on the weapon while shooting and ""a torrent of bullets shoot out.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Haley’s campaign manager Betsy Ankney told CNN that Haley will travel to Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine and Vermont over the course of the next 10 days.

Haley’s schedule shows where the campaign sees fertile ground, mostly states in the northeast and in the western part of the country.

Massachusetts and Vermont have a winner-take-all rule if one candidate clinches more than 50% of the vote, and the campaign thinks that hitting that goal could be possible for Haley, one campaign official said.

Campaign reaching out to donors: Haley has 10 fundraisers planned — with one in every state that she is visiting — according to a campaign email sent to donors and reviewed by CNN, which promises the sprint to be ""a wild ride.""

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close. Mail and early in-person votes will be reported first.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

George Santos.

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close. Mail and early in-person votes will be reported first.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

During that time, Bradley said, he had one conversation with Wade in their shared law office about the relationship.

“You’re testifying under oath that you had one conversation about a relationship between Mr. Wade and Miss Willis?” Sadow asked. “Is that correct?”

“I don’t recall having any other conversation with Mr. Wade about him and Ms. Willis,” Bradley responded.

“Is it your testimony then, that you don’t remember any other conversation or there wasn’t any other conversation besides the one?” Sadow asked.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“It's not where we need to be to actually fundamentally change the town. We have a trillion dollars of interest in 2026, guys. I mean, I don't know what to tell you. Something's got to stop. Something's got to change,"" he said.

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Andrew Harnik/AP

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he was worried about Americans being prosecuted under a ban they aren't aware of. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that while she was ""intuitively"" concerned about the bump stock devices, she questioned why the issue wouldn't be better handled by Congress.

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

""The entire point of this device,"" Justice Elena Kagan said, is that the shooter pushes forward on the weapon while shooting and ""a torrent of bullets shoot out.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the House Freedom Caucus and a deficit hawk, criticized the Speaker over his handling of the issue and lamented that he believes something has to change in Washington.

“It's not where we need to be to actually fundamentally change the town. We have a trillion dollars of interest in 2026, guys. I mean, I don't know what to tell you. Something's got to stop. Something's got to change,"" he said.

Rep. Nancy Mace, who was one of the eight lawmakers who voted to strip former Speaker Kevin McCarthy of the gavel, defended her vote even after Johnson reached a deal not too different from what ultimately led to the former Speaker’s ouster.

“He inherited a lot of Kevin McCarthy's bad deals, number one, so I don't fault him for that. But number two, I'm gonna say the same thing I've always said, Republicans and Democrats alike are spending too damn much, period,” she told CNN’s Manu Raju.

When pressed by CNN on what policy wins she believes they have achieved following McCarthy's ouster, she pointed to greater transparency from Johnson.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

George Santos.

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close. Mail and early in-person votes will be reported first.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chris Carlson/AP

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Under questioning from Donald Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, Bradley said he represented Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the Georgia election subversion case, between 2018 and mid-2022.

During that time, Bradley said, he had one conversation with Wade in their shared law office about the relationship.

“You’re testifying under oath that you had one conversation about a relationship between Mr. Wade and Miss Willis?” Sadow asked. “Is that correct?”

“I don’t recall having any other conversation with Mr. Wade about him and Ms. Willis,” Bradley responded.

“Is it your testimony then, that you don’t remember any other conversation or there wasn’t any other conversation besides the one?” Sadow asked.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

George Santos.

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close. Mail and early in-person votes will be reported first.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.
