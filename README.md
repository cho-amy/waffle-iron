## Intro:
**"Ever clicked on a headline so compelling that you just couldn't resist, only to find out the story was about as exciting as watching paint dry? üé® Welcome to the world of clickbait, the internet's version of 'bait and switch.' üé£ But what if we told you there's a way to sift through the sensational to find the substantial? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Enter our project: a large language model (LLM) processing pipeline that doesn't just read between the lines‚Äîit reads between the clicks. üëÄ**
