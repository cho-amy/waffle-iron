Nikki Haley at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire, on January 18. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Nikki Haley is set to participate in a CNN town hall tonight at 9 p.m. ET, just days before a New Hampshire primary that the onetime South Carolina governor hopes will shake loose former President Donald Trump’s hold on the 2024 Republican race.

Haley’s campaign has long viewed the Granite State — where the GOP primary electorate includes more moderates and independents than other early-voting states — as her best shot at a win. Trump, whose campaign in recent weeks has identified Haley as a threat, has escalated his attacks against her ahead of the primary.

Here are a few things to watch for at Thursday night's town hall:

Haley will need to hit Trump, but how? Wary of alienating the huge portion of the GOP base that remains loyal to the former president, Haley in recent days has lumped Trump together with President Joe Biden — swiping at both of them with an argument for generational change.

Will she reply to Trump's racist attacks? In a post Tuesday on his Truth Social platform, Trump slammed Haley while referring to her first name, Nimarata — which he misspelled as Nimrada. Trump also recently amplified a post that falsely claimed Haley was ineligible to run for president because her parents were not United States citizens at the time of her birth. She was born in South Carolina, and is a US citizen. Her response to these attacks will be a key element of this town hall.

If Haley defeats Trump in New Hampshire, all eyes would be on the Palmetto State’s February 24 primary

(Al Drago/Pool/AP)

The latest hearing before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection revealed new details Tuesday about how former President Donald Trump pressured state officials to help him overturn the 2020 presidential election.

The panel featured testimony from three Republican officials who were all on the receiving end of Trump's outreach after the election: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, his deputy Gabe Sterling and Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers.

Like previous hearings, these officials testified about their unwillingness to participate in legally dubious schemes that would undermine the election, including efforts to subvert the Electoral College with fake pro-Trump electors.

The panel's next hearing is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET on Thursday and will focus on Trump's attempt to use the Justice Department to back his election disinformation.

Here are some of the key takeaways from Tuesday's hearing:

Republican witnesses tie Trump directly to fake electors effort

Multiple witnesses told the committee that Trump was personally involved in the effort to put forward slates of fake electors in key battleground states — a key part of the broader effort to overturn Biden's legitimate election victory.

CNN has previously reported on the role that key Trump allies, including his former attorney Rudy Giuliani, played in overseeing the effort but witnesses revealed new details Tuesday about how the former President himself was not only aware of the push, but seemingly endorsed it.

Bowers told the committee that he received a call from Trump and Giuliani during which they urged him to go along with a plan to put forward illegitimate, pro-Trump electors from the state.

""I told them I did not want to be used as a pawn,"" Bowers said on Tuesday, recalling what he told Giuliani and Trump on the Nov. 22, 2020 phone call.

Committee reveals new details about how congressional Republicans helped Trump's efforts to overturn election

Tuesday's hearing featured new details about two congressional Republicans played a role in Trump's sprawling efforts to try to overturn his 2020 election loss. The first was Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who called Bowers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, asking him to support decertification of his state's electors for Biden.

""I said I would not,"" Bowers testified on Tuesday.

The second occurred several hours later, minutes before then-Vice President Mike Pence gaveled in the joint session of Congress to certify the electoral votes. According to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked an aide to Pence how Johnson could hand-deliver him the fake slates of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, which had not been sent to the National Archives. Pence's aide responded that Johnson should ""not give that to him.""

Both the effort to decertify Biden electors and put forward fake Trump electors were part of the Trump team's scheme to stop the congressional certification of the election on Jan. 6. The role that Trump's allies in Congress played have been of interest of interest to the committee, which has subpoenaed five House GOP members, including Biggs and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

Witnesses describe how Trump's lies had serious consequences — including threats

The committee's hearing underscored how the lies about the election spread by Trump and his team spiraled into multi-faceted disasters for the state officials forced to grapple with them.

All of the witnesses who appeared at Tuesday's hearing talked about the serious repercussions they faced as a result of the false claims that Trump and his team put forward. That included pressure to help in the effort to overturn the election, the repeated attempts to try to debunk the claims and the threats they faced from pro-Trump supporters for refusing to go along with Trump's efforts.

Bowers delivered emotional testimony about ""disturbing"" protests outside his home. He got emotional as he discussed the impact protests at this house had on his wife and his daughter, who was at home gravely ill at the time and was ""upset by what was happening outside."" He also read passages from his personal journal about friends who had turned on him.

Raffensperger described the attacks that his wife faced after the election, which he said he suspected was an attempt to pressure him to quit. Schiff cited Raffensperger's book, in which he wrote, ""I felt then and still believe today that this was a threat.""

Republican officials take the lead testifying against Trump

Yet again, the Democratic-run January 6 committee turned to Republican officials to make their case against Trump. In fact, the majority of the in-person witnesses so far have been Republicans.

Tuesday's hearing featured in-person testimony from three conservative Republicans who endorsed Trump in 2020. The committee also played deposition clips from two other GOP officials: Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler.

They all provided damning testimony against Trump, describing how he repeatedly tried to twist their arms and cajole them to overturn the results. They also described the threats and pressure they faced from Trump supporters who believed his election lies and protested outside their homes and offices and bombarded them with calls and text messages.

Top Arizona Republican refutes Trump in real-time

Bowers said under oath Tuesday that Trump lied about him in a press release that came out shortly before the hearing started, where Trump claimed Bowers told him in November 2020 that he believed the election was rigged.

In the statement, Trump attacked Bowers and described a call they had after the election, claiming, ""during the conversation, he told me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona."" Trump added, ""Bowers should hope there's not a tape of the conversation.""

Under questioning from Schiff, Bowers confirmed that he ""did have a conversation with the president, but that certainly isn't it.""

Emotional testimony highlights victims of Trump's disinformation

Later in the day, the committee heard from Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, who were election workers in Atlanta during the 2020 election. Trump, Giuliani and other GOP figures put them both at the center of their unhinged lies about massive voter fraud in Georgia.

Coverage of Trump's presidency often focused on his words and lies. But the emotional and deeply personal testimony from Moss and Freeman flipped the script and showed the human toll of Trump's lies.

They described in devastating terms how Trump's lies essentially destroyed their lives.

Moss said she felt ""helpless"" and stopped giving out her business card because ""I don't want anyone knowing my name."" Her mother said she gets ""nervous when I have to give food orders"" because someone who believes Trump's lies might recognize her name. She said she felt ""homeless"" while she lived in hiding for two months after the FBI told her she wasn't safe at home.

""I have lost my sense of security, all because of a group of people, starting with (Trump) and his ally Rudy Giuliani, decided to scapegoat me, and my daughter, Shaye, to push lies about how the election was stolen,"" Freeman said in a videotaped deposition, a clip of which was played during Tuesday's hearing.",2022-06-21,1

At times, the lawsuits have contested ballots in the double digits — hundreds if not thousands of votes away of potentially swing any state’s result.

“Admitting defeat is not a plausible reaction so soon after the election, so they throw a lot of Hail Mary lawsuits at the wall and hope something sticks,” said longtime Republican elections lawyer and CNN contributor Ben Ginsberg. He said these types of suits aren’t indicative of a campaign that’s feeling optimistic — and instead, is scrambling.

“I think much of the litigation is a longshot and unlikely to succeed,” said Franita Tolson, a law professor at USC Gould School of Law and CNN contributor.

She pointed to a lawsuit in Georgia the Trump campaign announced Wednesday night over a poll worker mixing unprocessed and processed absentee ballots. That might have the potential to affect few votes, she said.

“I suspect that a big goal of this litigation is, in the short term, to change the narrative” from a potential Biden win to a conversation about election mismanagement or even fraud, Tolson said.

Another law professor and CNN contributor, Rick Hasen, said the lawsuits appeared to be more public relations than serious litigation. “These lawsuits so far are not tackling any major problem that would seem to call overall vote totals into questions,” he said.

Justin Levitt, another elections expert and law professor, called some of the suits, like in Michigan, “laughable.”

“One says you didn’t put people by absentee dropboxes, so stop the count. Huh?!”

Even a Republican-appointed federal judge in Pennsylvania cast doubt on the validity of a suit from Republicans on Wednesday, when they challenged fewer than 100 ballots that absentee voters corrected in a county outside Philadelphia. At a hearing Wednesday morning, the judge, Timothy Savage, did not rule, yet he suggested the lawyer for Republican canvass observers was seeking to disenfranchise votes. He noted the lawsuit appeared to have other problems in its arguments.

Some legal challenges in Pennsylvania from the Trump campaign were quickly dismissed on Election Day, with Trump touting his appeals of those losses apparently as new cases Wednesday. For instance, a Philadelphia election day judge had shot down a Trump campaign case over ballot processing access, writing that “observers are directed only to observe and not to audit ballots” and deciding that the city’s board of elections complied with the law. Another Election Day challenge from the Trump campaign to the ballot observation process in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, also near Philly, was dismissed by a judge, though Trump is now appealing, according to Pennsylvania court records.

Lawyers for the Trump campaign sued in Nevada on Tuesday, too, claiming that their observers were not given enough access to all aspects of the ballot counting process — from opening the ballots, to machine and manual signature checking and duplicating spoiled ballots. A Nevada judge denied the GOP challenge to the early voting process in the heavily Democratic county.

“If this last-minute suit were successful, it would require a major change in how [Nevada] processed absentee [ballots] to determine if the signature on the ballot matched the voter’s prior signature on file,” said Richard Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University and CNN election law analyst. “Courts are typically unwilling to let plaintiffs come in the door so late in the day and ask for major changes to a process that’s already well underway.”

However, one suit, the petition before the US Supreme Court on Pennsylvania’s ballot deadline, may be a more serious litigation challenge. It challenges the validity of potentially several thousand votes cast in good faith by voters, but received by officials after the election through the mail.

For this case to make a difference, Pennsylvania would need to be the deciding state for the election, and the margin of difference between Trump and Biden would need to be a few tens of thousands of votes.

The grave political crisis created by Trump’s aberrant presidency and subsequent efforts to hold him to account deepened significantly just before midnight with the unsealing of yet another indictment against him – this one from a grand jury in the critical swing state of Georgia.

The charges in this state case – which bring to 91 the total number of criminal charges he’s facing across four separate cases – intensified an already epochal collision between Trump’s now extreme legal quagmire and the 2024 election in which he is the front-runner for the Republican nomination.

Former President Donald Trump will win the Iowa caucuses, CNN projected on Monday, solidifying his place as the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination.

CNN’s projection was based on entrance polls conducted for the National Election Pool by Edison Research. These polls are carried out at a scientifically random sample of caucus sites across the state among voters who have shown up to participate.

As of 7 p.m. CT/8 p.m. ET, doors at caucus sites had closed and no one else would be allowed inside to participate, and entrance poll interviewing was complete.

At the time of CNN’s projection, at 7:30 p.m. CT/8:30 p.m. ET, the former president's broad lead in the entrance poll’s representative sample was statistically significant.

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent.

US Capitol Police arrested a Virginia man as he attempted to pass through a police checkpoint in a locked-down zone of downtown Washington, DC, Friday with “unauthorized” inaugural credentials, an unregistered handgun and over 500 rounds of ammunition, according to court documents.

Shortly after 6:30 p.m., Wesley Allen Beeler, 31, stopped at the checkpoint just north of the Capitol building, according to a police affidavit made public Saturday, and presented the credential that was “not authorized to enter the restricted area.”

Beeler was released from custody Saturday after a brief court appearance in Washington, DC, Superior Court. A law enforcement official said that investigators do not consider him a threat to public safety.

When police asked Beeler if he was carrying any weapons, Beeler told them he had a Glock semi-automatic pistol in the center armrest, according to the court document, which noted that the gun was loaded.

Police later recovered the pistol, as well as 509 rounds of ammunition, shotgun shells and a magazine for the handgun, according to an incident report provided by the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department. Beeler was arrested for possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of unregistered ammunition, among other offenses, the report said.

CNN had originally reported that the credential Beeler presented was “fake,” citing the law enforcement official, but the affidavit released Saturday described it as “unauthorized.”

Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki said Beeler had presented “a non-government issued credential.”

In an interview, Beeler’s mother, Charlotte Beeler, said that her son worked in armed security and had been on a job in the Capitol area for the past few days.

He was ordered to stay out of DC except for in-person court appointments and meetings with his lawyer. Government prosecutors had not opposed his release under the conditions.

Beeler appeared via video conference in the hearing wearing a dark jacket and a face mask. He spoke only briefly, once telling a judge “yes, ma’am,” when asked if he understood the conditions of his release.

He is scheduled to return to court in June.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He also offered qualified support for social spending programs to help support newborns and new parents but stopped short of specifically endorsing paid family leave for all Americans or subsidized child care.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

In conversations with voters in New York's 3rd Congressional District, many said immigration was a top issue in Tuesday's special election.

For Republicans, the issue represents more than just the border thousands of miles away, it also is a gateway to anxieties voters feel about crime and the economy. Immigration is a topic that Republicans have hammered Democrat Tom Suozzi on during this race. It has also taken on renewed resonance here as a migrant shelter opened on the edge of the district last summer and local headlines recount a spree of crimes migrants are accused of including an attack against the New York Police Department.

But GOP officials admit that the issue may not resonate around the country even as they test drive it here. Suozzi has managed to argue he — not Republican candidate Mazi Pilip — is the only person offering solutions in the race.

Suozzi focused much of his campaign on targeting voters who were looking for bipartisan solutions, touting his role in the bipartisan Problem Solver’s Caucus and it’s a message that seemed to resonate.

Two voters who voted for Donald Trump said they were voting for Suozzi because they felt like he was the only candidate they trusted to work across the aisle. Suozzi has centered his defense of immigration on the now-dead Senate border compromise. The same voters said they also liked the fact that Souzzi was a familiar face who was active in the community and had a proven track record whereas PIlip is a relatively unknown commodity.

The issue has dominated the airwaves with Suozzi and his allies releasing five ads on the topic while Pilip and groups supporting her released nine.",2024-02-14,2

Former President Donald Trump will not accept a plea deal in the indictment brought by a Manhattan grand jury but does plan to file “substantial legal challenges” to the indictment, his attorney Joe Tacopina said.

“President Trump will not take a plea deal in this case. It's not gonna happen,” Tacopina said in an interview with NBC News on Friday.

“I don't know if it's gonna make it to trial because we have substantial legal challenges that we have to ... front before we get to that point,” Tacopina said when asked if he expects to take the case to trial.

Trump will “absolutely” voluntarily surrender to Manhattan law enforcement, the defense attorney said, adding the former president is “not going to hole up in Mar-a-Lago.”

Logistics are currently being worked, he said.

Meanwhile, Trump attorney Jim Trusty said Friday he expects that the former president's legal team will file motions to dismiss his indictment before a trial could potentially get underway.

“I would think in very short order, you'll see a motion to dismiss — or several motions to dismiss — talking about this kind of impossible theory of stacking a federal crime into a state misdemeanor, statute of limitations issues and very importantly, the intent to defraud. That's an element of these false record keeping charges. That's just not present here,"" Trusty told CNN This Morning.

The lawyer said he did not know ""about the exact timing"" as there isn't a case number yet but he noted that it will ""be soon.""

""I think this will be something you can expect in days or weeks, not weeks or months,"" he added.

Tacopina told Good Morning America that the former president ""will not be put in handcuffs.""

Responding to CNN reporting that Trump has been charged on more than 30 counts related to business fraud, Tacopina said he does not know the nature of the charges against Trump or how many there are, but added, “If it's correct, it means they've taken each transaction, each check, each payment, each entry and made a separate charge.”

Tacopina said he does not know when the charges will be unsealed but suggested it “might likely be Tuesday.”",2023-03-31,1

(Andrew Kelly/Pool/Reuters)

Tuesday’s arraignment of former President Donald Trump was a whirlwind of historic firsts.

Now the wait begins for the long slog of the judicial system to play out, with the next scheduled actions in court months away.

Away from the courthouse, however, Trump quickly went back to attacking Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Judge Juan Merchan, along with their families – raising questions about whether his rhetoric could land him in hot water legally.

Here’s what’s next in Trump’s New York criminal case: During Tuesday’s arraignment, prosecutors said they were negotiating the logistics of a “protective order” with Trump’s defense team, which would limit how Trump and his attorneys can use the documents they will be given from the grand jury proceedings during the discovery process.

Prosecutors specifically said they want to prohibit Trump from posting any discovery materials to social media or sharing them with third parties, such as journalists. They also said they plan to allow Trump to review certain sensitive materials only with his lawyers.

Trump’s attorneys will have to agree to the specifics of the agreement, but the exchanges showed the concern in the district attorney’s office about what Trump might say or post about the evidence they hand over.

“The entirety of the prosecution’s case file will soon have to be turned over to the defense,” Agnifilo said. “Prosecutors don’t want it made public because they’re focused on the proceedings and know Trump will try this in the court of public opinion way before any trial in a court. That’s where the integrity of the proceedings can get really dicey — and that’s what they’re trying to accomplish with a protective order.”

When could a trial actually start? If the case goes to trial, it’s not going to be until next year — when Trump could be in the thick of the 2024 Republican presidential primary.

Merchan set an August 8 deadline for Trump’s lawyers to file motions in the case — such as an attempt to get the charges dismissed or reduced to misdemeanors. Prosecutors will have until September 19 to respond, and then Merchan expects to rule on the motions at the December hearing.

The next hearing date for the case is December 4.

Prosecutors asked Merchan to plan on a trial beginning in January 2024, but Trump’s attorneys suggested that the spring might be more realistic, given they had not yet received any documents in the case.

Merchan seemed to side with Trump’s lawyers.

“I understand what you are saying,” Merchan said. “I think that is reasonable. You have not received discovery. It is difficult to anticipate if you will be ready for trial in January of 2024. The message I would like to deliver is we would like to move ahead as expeditiously as possible, without undue delay.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the one-time press secretary and communications director for former President Donald Trump, will win Arkansas’ gubernatorial race, CNN projects.

She will be the first woman elected governor of Arkansas.

Huckabee Sanders defeated Democrat Chris Jones, who is a minister and former non-profit leader who got a degree in nuclear engineering from MIT.

Arkansas last elected a Democratic governor in 2010 and it’s now a solidly red state.

Sanders, while a first-time candidate, is no stranger to politics. Her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, was governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. And by defeating Democrat Chris Jones, Sanders will also become the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.

Sanders previously worked for two years in the George W. Bush administration and later ran her father’s 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and then was campaign manager for his 2016 bid.

She gained national prominence in her role as former President Donald Trump’s White House press secretary, serving as a staunch defender of the then-President and his policies for more than two years. On many occasions, she clashed with national reporters and eventually scaled back televised briefings. She defended the move, saying that journalists could hear from Trump directly.

Sanders earned an early endorsement from Trump after joining the race for Arkansas governor, and prominent rivals later dropped out of the race, clearing her path to the GOP nomination.

Sanders’ path to victory in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Asa Hutchison was relatively smooth – unsurprising in a state that has taken a sharp turn to the right in recent years. But the campaign was not without personal challenges. In September, Sanders announced she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and “underwent a successful surgery to remove my thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes.”

In her race for governor, Sanders defended her decision to grant only a handful of interviews with local media, saying she’s been speaking to voters directly.

“Freedom of the press is incredibly important, but with freedom of the press also comes a great deal of responsibility, and when they don’t live up to their end of the bargain, it forces some of us to go outside of the box, which I have done every single day for the last two years,” Sanders said at an October 21 debate hosted by the Arkansas PBS station.

In the debate, Sanders highlighted key issues of her campaign, including her education plan, Arkansas LEARNS, to increase literacy rates, and her support for phasing out the state income tax, though she has not explicitly stated a timeline for doing so.

(Jason Bean/Reno Gazette Journal/USA Today Network)

Vice President Kamala Harris will make the case for President Joe Biden’s 2024 reelection bid Tuesday at a political rally on reproductive freedom, a Harris adviser told CNN, saying that ""finishing the job"" is about fighting to protect abortion and other rights facing nationwide restrictions.

Harris will ""highlight the extremism of elected Republicans and the unrelenting attacks on women and healthcare providers state by state,"" the adviser said.

The rally draws an immediate contrast with Biden, who is likely to shun more campaign-style events in the coming months. Earlier, a Biden adviser previously told CNN, ""he’s just gonna keep doing his schedule.""

The event at the vice president’s alma mater Howard University will be a high-profile moment for Harris, crystallizing her role as the administration’s lead messenger in its efforts to safeguard access to abortion on a day where all eyes are on the White House following Biden’s announcement. Abortion rights protests were featured prominently in Biden’s long-awaited reelection campaign announcement video.

But Biden and Harris face significant political headwinds in their bid for a second term, including low approval numbers and an unenthusiastic American electorate. A majority of voters, recent polling shows, does not want Biden to seek a second term, citing age as a major factor.

Still, the president said in his Tuesday video that ""the question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer,"" a clear indication that issues like abortion will loom large in his argument to American voters. Abortion rights were a motivating issue for Democrats during the 2022 midterm election, and Biden officials hope to utilize the same energy in 2024.

""It’s a winning issue for them,"" a source close to the vice president’s office told CNN.

More about the vice president's remarks: Harris is expected to ""describe the moment we’re in,"" according to the adviser. She will address what the adviser called ""extremist"" Republicans who seek to make abortion bans federal law. She’ll also discuss book bans, voting rights and gun safety, the adviser said.

Harris’ Tuesday remarks also come less than a week after the Supreme Court issued a brief protecting access to medication abortion and blocking a court ruling that revoked the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of the drug mifepristone while an appeal works its way through lower courts.",2023-04-25,1

Here is a fact check of the claims Trump has made about the investigation since the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago resort and residence in August 2022.

False claim: Trump was following the Presidential Records Act by refusing to immediately return documents

Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Presidential Records Act, a 1978 law, says he was supposed to hold negotiations with the National Archives and Records Administration about the return of official documents after his presidency.

For example, he said in a March 2023 interview on Fox that the law is “very specific”: “It says you are going to discuss the documents. You discuss everything – not only docu– everything – about what’s going in NARA, et cetera, et cetera. You’re gonna discuss it. You will talk, talk, talk. And if you can’t come to an agreement, you’re gonna continue to talk.”

He made a similar claim at a CNN town hall in May, saying the law “says you talk, you negotiate, you make a deal.”

Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. The Presidential Records Act says that, the moment a president leaves office, NARA gets custody and control of all presidential records from his administration. Nothing in the law says there should be a negotiation between a former president and NARA over a former president’s return of presidential documents – much less that there should have been a monthslong battle after NARA first contacted Trump’s team in 2021 to try to get some of the records that had not been handed over at the end of his presidency.

The key sentence from the Presidential Records Act is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”

False claim: Obama, the Bushes and others took millions of documents home with them after leaving office

Trump has repeatedly claimed that he has been singled out by federal law enforcement even though his predecessors as president all took documents with them after leaving office.

For example, Trump claimed in the fall of 2022 that former presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush all took millions of documents; he repeated the claim that Obama took documents at the CNN town hall in May. He also claimed that George H.W. Bush took his documents to a poorly secured Chinese restaurant and bowling alley.

Facts First: This is all false, as NARA itself pointed out in a statement in 2022. In reality, NARA was granted custody of the presidential records of former presidents (beginning with Ronald Reagan as soon as these presidents left office) as soon as these presidents left office, as required by the Presidential Records Act, and it was NARA, not those presidents, that moved those documents out of the nation’s capital to NARA-managed temporary archival facilities near where their permanent presidential libraries would be built. The NARA-managed facility where records from the George H.W. Bush administration were stored was indeed a former restaurant and bowling alley, but it had been turned into a full-fledged archival facility, and professionally secured in various ways, by the time the documents were moved in.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images

President Donald Trump's physicians are giving him several different treatments — including investigational drugs — in the hope of relieving his Covid-19 symptoms and possibly shortening his course of illness.

While many questions remain about the President's condition and when he was first diagnosed with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, here is what has been revealed so far about what he was been treated with — and when.

Regeneron's monoclonal antibody therapy: On Friday afternoon, the White House said in a letter that Trump was treated with an 8-gram dose of the experimental antibody therapy cocktail made by the biotechnology company Regeneron. The investigational cocktail, known by its investigational name REGN-COV2, has been in clinical trials since June.

Remdesivir: President Trump is being given a five-day course of the antiviral drug remdesivir, one of the doctors treating him said during a briefing on Saturday. The treatment is intended to shorten recovery time for Covid-19 patients. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, remdesivir was found to speed recovery in moderately ill patients with pneumonia from Covid-19, according to results published in the medical journal JAMA in August.

Dexamethasone: Trump was given the corticosteroid drug dexamethasone on Saturday after his oxygen level transiently dipped, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said during a briefing on Sunday. The drug is typically given to patients on supplemental oxygen or needing ventilation.

Supplemental oxygen: After previously telling reporters on Saturday that Trump ""is not on oxygen right now,"" White House physician Conley said during a briefing on Sunday that the President had been given supplemental oxygen and had two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen level. Oxygen therapy, or supplemental oxygen, is a treatment that delivers oxygen gas for patients to breathe who may have difficulty breathing.

China can control the surveillance balloon to an extent, for example by turning on and off the surveillance gear inside of it, the sources said. The fact that China does have some control over the balloon’s capabilities is why the US government has raised their concerns with Beijing about it, the sources said.

What US officials are saying: The balloon’s surveillance equipment appears to be powered by a solar array, one US official said, which would provide the system with a reliable source of power at high altitude. But the solar array does not appear to be connected to any type of motor that would allow China to steer the balloon, the official added.

Pentagon officials said they did not believe the balloon had surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities above and beyond Chinese spy satellites in low earth orbit, but unlike satellites that pass rapidly over a location every 90 minutes, a spy balloon can loiter over a spot and gather more of a “pattern of life” of a particular site, the official said.

In the past, the US has simply allowed balloons like this to waft away, without taking any action or publicizing their presence over the US, the sources said. It is also not the first time a surveillance balloon has appeared over the United States.

The US official said there were similar incidents with suspected Chinese surveillance balloons over Hawaii and Guam in recent years. On Thursday, a senior defense official said, “Instances of this activity have been observed over the past several years, including prior to this administration.”

The US government now believes that it has gotten China’s attention about the balloon, and that the matter could be resolved soon, the sources said.",2023-02-03,1

Will Lanzoni/CNN

The 2024 presidential campaign is only beginning, but former President Donald Trump made clear that his third bid for the White House will feel very much like the first two.

Trump might be trying a new tack in this campaign, running what is, to date, a more conventional race with less internal drama. But when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, the 76-year-old showed on Wednesday night that he is very much the same person Americans came to know in 2016, throughout his four years in office, and in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat.

Unsurprisingly, the mostly Trump-loyal audience lapped it up. Trump’s place in the GOP primary polls, as he often mentioned, is strong. In New Hampshire on Wednesday night, he showed why.

Here are some takeaways from Trump’s CNN town hall:

Trump says GOP should be willing to blow up debt ceiling: The US is on the brink of a catastrophic default on its sovereign debt. Asked what his advice is to Republicans in Washington, Trump was clear. “If they don’t give you massive cuts,” he said, “you’re going to have to do a default.” The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking so-called extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.

Trump makes dismissive comments about Carroll: A little more than 24 hours after a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, and awarded her $5 million, the former president denied the accusations and again said he had never met Carroll. “This woman, I don’t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is,” Trump said, before going off on an odd tangent about her former husband and a pet.

Trump also brushed off a question over whether the verdict would hurt his standing with female voters, saying he doubted it. The reaction from the Trump-friendly audience appeared to support his opinion – they laughed at his jokes and other dismissive comments about Carroll.

Trump doesn’t say if he would back Ukraine in war with Russia: Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to prevail in its war with invading Russia.“I don’t think in terms of winning and losing,” he said, “I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people.” Asked to choose a side he would prefer to win, Trump again demurred. “I want everyone to stop dying,” he said before promising to end the war in “24 hours.”

Trump suggests family separation immigration policy could return: Trump said he would return to one of the harshest immigration enforcement policies imposed by his administration: separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said. His comments come as Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restriction that became a key tool officials used to expel migrants at the US-Mexico border, is set to expire Thursday.

Trump was vague on federal abortion ban: Trump repeatedly ducked questions about whether he would sign into law a federal abortion ban, as well as questions regarding after how many weeks into a pregnancy abortion should be made illegal. He touted the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion rights as “such a great victory” – and one made possible by his appointment of three conservative justices. Trump said he supports exemptions to abortion bans for cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is threatened. “We now have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done,” Trump said.

There was a muted response in the room of Nikki Haley’s campaign party when CNN projected that Donald Trump would win the South Carolina primary — until the former president started speaking.

A man started waving a South Carolina loves Nikki Haley sign in front of the projection of Trump speaking, and moments later chants for Haley broke out.

“I don’t think it is over,” Nell Parker, a Haley supporter in the room told CNN. Parker said she plans to rally North Carolina for Haley, and feels good about her odds going forward.

“We are for anyone against Trump,” said another Haley supporter in the room.

Others said they did not trust the projection, and were frustrated about polls generally.

No one in the room said they believe this is the beginning of the end for Haley.

The Haley campaign say they feel that they did everything they could to effectively compete in South Carolina, but aides said frustrations arose throughout the last month given the strong hold that Trump has on the state. For example, the Republican group at Clemson University endorsed Trump, which was frustrating for Haley’s team given the school is her alma mater.",2024-02-25,6

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

""I'm a woman of my word,"" she said in Charleston, South Carolina, referring to her earlier pledge to stay in the race until Super Tuesday. ""I'm not giving up this fight when a majority of Americans disapprove of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden.""

Haley’s remarks were presented in a more somber tone, compared to her speech following the New Hampshire primary.

She said she does not believe Trump can beat Biden in a rematch presidential election, saying that ""Trump drives people away.""

Haley also acknowledged she lost by a wide margin, but highlighted “40% is not some tiny group.” She made the case that while she has lost four states to the former president, there are many more that still haven’t voted.

""In the next 10 days, another 21 states and territories will speak. They have the right to a real choice, not a Soviet-style election with only one candidate,"" she said. ""And I have a duty to give them that choice.""

She also went on to reiterate she isn’t running for the vice presidency.

Andrew Harnik/AP

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.",2024-02-25,6

Massachusetts and Vermont have a winner-take-all rule if one candidate clinches more than 50% of the vote, and the campaign thinks that hitting that goal could be possible for Haley, one campaign official said.

In conversations with voters in New York's 3rd Congressional District, many said immigration was a top issue in Tuesday's special election.

For Republicans, the issue represents more than just the border thousands of miles away, it also is a gateway to anxieties voters feel about crime and the economy. Immigration is a topic that Republicans have hammered Democrat Tom Suozzi on during this race. It has also taken on renewed resonance here as a migrant shelter opened on the edge of the district last summer and local headlines recount a spree of crimes migrants are accused of including an attack against the New York Police Department.

But GOP officials admit that the issue may not resonate around the country even as they test drive it here. Suozzi has managed to argue he — not Republican candidate Mazi Pilip — is the only person offering solutions in the race.

Suozzi focused much of his campaign on targeting voters who were looking for bipartisan solutions, touting his role in the bipartisan Problem Solver’s Caucus and it’s a message that seemed to resonate.

Two voters who voted for Donald Trump said they were voting for Suozzi because they felt like he was the only candidate they trusted to work across the aisle. Suozzi has centered his defense of immigration on the now-dead Senate border compromise. The same voters said they also liked the fact that Souzzi was a familiar face who was active in the community and had a proven track record whereas PIlip is a relatively unknown commodity.

The issue has dominated the airwaves with Suozzi and his allies releasing five ads on the topic while Pilip and groups supporting her released nine.",2024-02-15,7

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Before entering the courtroom in New York on Thursday morning, Trump claimed the hush money case against him is “election interference.” He also argued that it is interfering with his ability to campaign in South Carolina ahead of the February 24 Republican presidential primary there.

“How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again — this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said.

Trump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in South Carolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.”

Facts First: Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in New York on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances.

Rather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a hearing related to charges he faces in Georgia.

And he had not been scheduled to be in South Carolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the New York hearing. His next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week. His next rally after the Thursday hearing is a Saturday event in Michigan.

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

First results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close.

Momentum to plot a swift impeachment of Mayorkas picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republicans expressed openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border.

Border authorities encountered more than 225,000 migrants along the US-Mexico border in December, marking the highest monthly total recorded since 2000, according to preliminary Homeland Security statistics shared with CNN. And in fiscal year 2022, according to the Department of Homeland Security, 1.4 million individuals who were encountered at the border were removed, which is more than in any previous year.

The border crisis has galvanized Republicans, unifying their party for more aggressive action on an issue central to the 2024 campaign, and a handful of the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to scuttle an effort to impeach Mayorkas in November 2023 recently signaled they’d back impeaching him if it went through the committee process, which happened late last month.

Moderate Republicans, including ones in districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020, also signaled more willingness to impeach Mayorkas than the president – a sign of the shifting political terrain on the issue.

While House Republicans have sought to use Mayorkas' impeachment to address their issues with Biden's handling of the border, the GOP also helped to tank – along with Donald Trump – a major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package that would have marked a tough change to immigration law championed by one of the Senate's most conservative members. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber, even if it ever made it out of the Senate.

Mayorkas wrote in a letter in advance of the vote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.”

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

We spoke to Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor and author of the new book, “Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away With It,” for a refresher on how grand juries and indictments work. Part of our conversation, conducted by phone, is below:

Grand jury vs. trial jury

WOLF: What should we know about the difference between a grand jury and a trial jury?

HONIG: A grand jury decides to indict, meaning to charge a case. A trial jury determines guilt or non-guilt.

A grand jury is bigger, typically 23 members, and the prosecutor only needs the votes of a majority of a grand jury — as opposed to a trial jury, which has to be unanimous.

The standard of proof in a grand jury is lower than a trial jury. In a grand jury, you only have to show probable cause, meaning more likely than not. But of course in a trial setting, you need to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The other thing to know is a grand jury is an almost entirely one-sided process.

Usually the only people allowed in the room at all are the grand jurors, the prosecutors, the witnesses and a court reporter.

In some instances, including New York, there’s a limited right of a potential defendant to present some evidence, but no defense lawyers are allowed in the room.

There’s no cross-examination of the prosecution’s evidence. There’s no presentation of defense evidence.

Close to every time a prosecutor seeks an indictment from a grand jury, he or she will get an indictment from the grand jury.

What is an indictment?

WOLF: How would you define “indictment”?

HONIG: It’s a document setting forth formal charges against the defendant.

3 Trump grand juries

WOLF: We have three grand juries that are top of mind — for election meddling in Georgia, at the federal level for declassified documents and then the Manhattan DA. How much variation is there in grand juries between city, county and federal?

HONIG: There are minor variations, but the basics remain the same.

Here’s an example of one of the minor variations in New York State, but not in the federal system, meaning for DOJ. The defendant does have some limited right to be notified and given a chance to testify or present defense evidence, which we saw play out with Trump and then him asking Robert Costello to testify.

That’s not the case federally. You do not have to give a defendant a chance to testify or present evidence. That’s one slight variation. But the basic fundamentals are the same.",2023-03-30,1

The appeals court has set up a very fast schedule for Donald Trump to ask the Supreme Court to block their ruling rejecting his claims of immunity from criminal prosecution.

The court is giving Trump until February 12 to file an emergency stay request with the Supreme Court, which would stop the clock while his attorneys craft a more substantive appeal on the merits. If he is successful with that, the criminal trial will not resume until after the high court decides what to do with his request for a pause.

Steve Womack Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

House Republicans were exasperated after the stunning defeat of their resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, lobbing some criticism at their own leadership over the fiasco even as they plan to bring the vote back up again when they have better attendance.

GOP Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said it was unwise of leadership to put the bill on the floor not knowing for sure whether it would pass, adding to the perception that House Republicans can’t govern.

“It's hard to sit there and see it, you know, I mean, it's tough. We're in a difficult spot right now,” he said. “If we whipped, we need a better whip. I'm not talking about the person in the job. I'm just saying the whip count. We need to know exactly where we are and we need to be careful not to get out ahead of our skis and put something on the floor that we don't have certainty on.”

Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina also criticized GOP leadership’s strategy on the Mayorkas vote.

“I would have thought they would have known that. I would have thought that would have been basic,” Norman said of the whip count. “They’re good on the other side of knowing that. Is it that hard?”

“But it did happen, it went down, and we live to fight another day,” he said.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene disputed that it was a miscalculation to put the bill on the floor, telling CNN, ""I don’t think it’s a failure at all,"" and warning that the Republicans who voted to sink the impeachment articles would be hearing from voters.

“I’m sure they’ll hear from their constituents. I’m sure they’re probably hearing from them already, but I think they should listen to them,"" the Georgia Republican said.

“I look forward to having Steve Scalise back. Of course, been praying for him this whole time to beat cancer,” she added, referring to the House majority leader who was absent from the vote as he recovers in Louisiana from a stem cell transplant.",2024-02-06,5

Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

A federal appeals court on Tuesday said that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency, flatly rejecting Trump’s arguments that he shouldn’t have to go on trial on federal election subversion charges.

Here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's decision:

Trump’s behavior after the 2020 election could be criminal: The judges made it clear that Trump's actions could be prosecuted in a court of law.

""Vital public interest"" of letting trial proceed weighed heavily on the court: The judges cited the public interest in accountability for potential crimes committed by a former president, and how that overcame Trump’s argument that immunity was necessary to protect the institution of the presidency. They flatly rejected Trump’s claim that his criminal indictment would have a “chilling effect” on future administrations.

Trial timing will be up to the Supreme Court: A key part of Trump’s legal strategy has been to delay his criminal cases until after the 2024 election. Now, the trial's timing will be in the hands of the Supreme Court. If Trump is successful with getting the Supreme Court to hear the appeal, the criminal trial would not resume until after the high court decides what to do with his request for a pause.",2024-02-06,5

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

“Even though it was a personal shot, and it was a shot that wasn't necessary, I think the bigger point is there are big differences between me and Ramaswamy. He doesn't think we should be helping Israel. He thinks that we should let Putin have Ukraine,” Haley said.

""We have real issues on that debate stage that differentiate us and that's what I wanted to talk about. He threw a petty shot there. It says more about him than it does about me,” she added.

Haley also responded to former President Donald Trump slamming her during his rally in Hialeah on Wednesday. Trump mocked the former South Carolina governor for previously saying she would not seek her party’s nomination if he opted to run a second time.

“Yes, I said I wouldn't run against him, but it was before we had the fall in Afghanistan, before we saw inflation go through the roof. It was before we lost the mid-terms…We cannot win the issues and fights of the 21st century if we continue to use politicians of the 20th century,” Haley said.

“It is slow and steady wins the race. We're now surging, second in Iowa, second in New Hampshire, second in South Carolina and we have one more fellow to go after and we'll do it.

Asked about Iranian proxies recently hitting US forces, Haley said it is “infuriating that our military men and women are having to deal with this.”

Charlie Neibergall/AP

The Colorado Supreme Court made history Tuesday with an unprecedented, freeze-in-your-tracks ruling that former President Donald Trump is constitutionally ineligible to run in 2024 because the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office covers his conduct on January 6, 2021.

The 4-3 decision removes Trump from the Republican primary ballot in Colorado, which is scheduled for Super Tuesday in early March. However, the Colorado justices paused their ruling so Trump can appeal to the US Supreme Court, which could even preserve his spot on the state’s primary ballot if the appeal isn’t settled quickly.

In many ways, the landmark ruling holds Trump accountable for trying to overturn the 2020 election and provides a political punishment for his anti-democratic behavior. The ruling is also a massive vindication for the liberal groups and constitutional scholars of all stripes who championed such 14th Amendment lawsuits despite their long odds.

Here are the key takeaways from the decision and what comes next:

Trump engaged in insurrection, court says: The top Colorado court upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the January 6 assault on the US Capitol was an insurrection and that Trump “engaged in” that insurrection.

These are key legal hurdles that the challengers needed to clear before Trump could be removed from any ballot, largely because the text of the 14th Amendment doesn’t actually define an “insurrection” or spell out what it means to “engage in” insurrection.

The justices also affirmed the decision that Trump’s January 6 speech at the Ellipse was not protected by the First Amendment. Trump has unsuccessfully pushed this argument in state and federal courts, which found that he incited violence when he told supporters to “walk down to the Capitol” and “fight like hell” to “take back our country.”

The ""insurrectionist ban"" does apply to Trump: The justices broke from the trial judge on one key issue, reversing her controversial decision that the “insurrectionist ban” applies to every office except the presidency.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment says oath-breaking insurrectionists can’t serve as senators, representatives, presidential electors, “or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State.” But it doesn’t mention the presidency.

This textual vagueness is why the trial judge kept Trump on the 2024 ballot. But the high court disagreed. And this was the linchpin of their decision to disqualify Trump.

The US Supreme Court will have the ultimate say: Everyone knows this isn’t the final word. The case is headed to the US Supreme Court.

It’s anyone’s guess how the justices will handle the case. How fast will they decide to take up the appeal? Will they hold oral arguments? How quickly will they issue a final decision? The answers to these questions will have implications for the political calendar, with the Iowa caucuses kicking off the GOP primary season in less than a month.

Before Americans pick a president in November, they get to pick the candidates in a series of primaries and caucuses.

It’s a wonky process that has evolved over the course of the country’s history and continues to evolve today.

Here’s what to know:

What is a primary?

It’s an election to select candidates, usually for a particular political party, to appear on the general election ballot. Primaries award delegates, and candidates must reach a magic number of delegates to win the nomination and appear on the general election ballot in November.

Who is ahead in the primaries?

Former President Donald Trump has long been the leader in polls for the Republican presidential primary, and he has the most delegates after the contest in Iowa. A large field of challengers has winnowed down to one major opponent, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who may have her best shot at beating Trump in New Hampshire’s primary.

President Joe Biden is the incumbent president and all but a lock to win the Democratic nomination, but he won’t even appear on the ballot in New Hampshire due to a disagreement between national Democrats and the state party over which primary should come first. Biden could still win New Hampshire’s primary through a write-in campaign, but the first sanctioned Democratic contest is in South Carolina in February.

When will we know who will win the primaries?

Keep an eye on Super Tuesday, March 5. While there won’t yet be enough delegates on the table to clinch the nomination, that is the night with the largest pot of delegates, where Republicans in 16 states and territories will vote for president.

It might take until May or June for one candidate to secure enough votes to win his or her party’s nomination. The last presidential primaries occur on June 4.

The earliest a candidate could mathematically win enough delegates to be the nominee is March 12.

Who can vote in a presidential primary?

It varies by state. Primaries are generally conducted in polling places like any other election.

But some states have “open primaries,” meaning any registered voter can vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary. Other states have “closed primaries,” meaning only people registered in a particular political party – usually Republicans or Democrats – can vote in that party’s primary.

Others offer voting day registration, which essentially opens the primaries to most registered voters.

When do the presidential primaries occur?

The first date on the presidential primary calendar was January 15, although it was not technically for a primary.

On that day in Iowa, Republican Party members gathered at events called caucuses, which are overseen by state parties and not conducted like normal elections. Trump won decisively.

Democrats also gathered that day in Iowa, but their vote for president is conducted by mail ending on March 5.

After Iowa, New Hampshire holds its “first-in-the-nation” primary on January 23, although Democrats are not sanctioning the event.

The calendar spreads out from there. Republicans compete in caucuses in Nevada and the US Virgin Islands on February 8 and South Carolina on February 24.

In some states, presidential primaries are conducted on one date and primaries for other offices are conducted later in the year. See the full calendar.

Delegates can either be apportioned through a winner-take-all system, meaning the top candidate in a state’s primary gets all of that state’s delegates, or they can be apportioned proportionally to the primary election results. Some states have thresholds where every candidate who gets over a certain amount of the vote – say, 20% – may be entitled to delegates.

Democrats these days apportion all of their delegates proportionally.

Republican rules this year generally require that states with primaries and caucuses before March 15 apportion delegates proportionally. States with primaries and caucuses after March 15 may switch to a winner-take-all format.

Delegates are mostly required to be “bound” (the Republican term) or “pledged” (the Democratic term) to a particular candidate heading into the convention.

A very small portion of delegates in certain states and territories on the Republican side are “unbound.” These few delegates can support whomever they choose at the outset of the convention.

Democrats have “unpledged” delegates – party bigwigs – but they do not cast ballots in the first round of voting on the convention floor if they could impact the outcome.

If there’s no clear majority winner after the delegates vote, they go to additional rounds of voting where the bound delegates become unbound so that they can ultimately select a nominee. This is what’s known as a “brokered convention.”

When we say this is rare, we mean it hasn’t happened since 1952.

How did this process come about?

It evolved over the course of the country’s history. It used to be congressional delegations who would select presidential candidates.

The first election for which there were political conventions for party members was 1832, when Andrew Jackson won the White House. The first convention was held by the short-lived and long-defunct Anti-Masonic Party.

The move toward focusing on primary elections and making the system more democratic began after violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, when party leaders had opted for then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey over anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy. (Humphrey went on to lose to Richard Nixon.)

Where and when are the 2024 conventions?

The Republican National Convention runs July 15-18 in Milwaukee.

The Democratic National Convention runs August 19-22 in Chicago.

Are there primaries that are not so focused on political parties?

Yes, but not for the office of president.

A growing number of states are experimenting with nonpartisan primaries, where all voters and candidates take part in one primary election and the top finishers, regardless of their party affiliation, square off on Election Day.

These nonpartisan primaries, which feature in statewide races for Senate and governor and for House races, are not used in the presidential election.

California, Nebraska and Washington use the top-two system. Alaska has a top-four system.

Louisiana has so-called “jungle primaries.” All candidates for local, state or federal office are listed on the Election Day ballot, and if no candidate gets a majority, the top-two finishers take part in a runoff.

Yes. The Green Party will likely have a presidential candidate on the ballot in most states, and the Libertarian Party expects to be on the ballot in all 50 states. These parties will select their nominees in their own conventions.

The last time a third-party or independent candidate secured electoral votes in a general election, however, was 1968.

Do the winners in Iowa and New Hampshire usually win the party’s nomination?

Not necessarily. In 2020, Biden didn’t win either Iowa or New Hampshire, but his campaign got a reset in South Carolina and he went on to the Democratic nomination and the White House.

In 2016, Trump lost Iowa but won New Hampshire, similar to fellow Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama won Iowa, but lost New Hampshire. Republican John McCain lost Iowa that year but won New Hampshire.

The last candidate to win both in Iowa and New Hampshire and go on to the White House was Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, although he technically placed second in Iowa, behind “uncommitted.”

Spencer Platt/Getty Images

An apparent backtrack by Donald Trump’s ex-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen threw the New York civil fraud trial into more chaos Wednesday afternoon.

Cohen gave combative testimony in the face of cross-examination to two Trump attorneys on Wednesday, after he had implicated Trump the day prior for directing him to “reverse-engineer” financial statements to increase his net worth.

On Wednesday morning, Trump attorney Alina Habba pressed Cohen about his 2019 congressional testimony when he said, “Not that I recall, no,” in response to a question about whether Trump had directed him or Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to inflate numbers for Trump’s personal statement.

Cohen said to Habba that he was lying in his testimony.

But after lunch, Cliff Robert, another Trump attorney, pressed Cohen further on his congressional testimony, and the former Trump attorney had a different response, saying that the testimony was not false.

“So, Mr. Trump never asked you to inflate the numbers on his financial statement,"" Robert asked.

“Correct,"" Cohen said.

That response prompted Trump’s attorney to ask the first time for a directed verdict to dismiss the trial because Cohen was a key witness in the case.

Engoron denied it, which led to Trump abruptly leaving the courtroom.

The New York attorney general's lawyers asked Cohen in follow up questions to clarify his response. Cohen said that Trump never directly asked to inflate the numbers, but that what he wanted was known, because he spoke like “a mob boss.”

""He tells you what he wants without specifically telling you,"" Cohen said. ""We understood what he wanted.”

At the conclusion of Cohen’s testimony, Robert renewed his request for a verdict to and ""end this case once and for all.""

“Absolutely denied,” Engoron said in response.

The case has evidence, credible or not, “all over the place,” the judge said.

Engoron also said he didn’t consider Cohen to be a “key witness” in the case, in which the New York attorney general accused Trump and his business of fraud in a $250 million suit.

“There’s enough evidence in this case to fill this courtroom,” Engoron said.",2023-10-25,1

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

All GOP representatives voted to formalize the inquiry, including Rep. Ken Buck who previously said he was leaning against it.

Part of the reason for Wednesday’s vote comes from the White House telling the trio of GOP-led congressional committees leading the investigation that its subpoenas were illegitimate without a formal House vote to authorize the inquiry, reluctant, more moderate Republican lawmakers started to get on board with their party’s investigative efforts.

The vote comes as the president's son Hunter Biden defied Republican investigator’s subpoena for closed-door testimony and reiterated that he is willing to testify publicly as part of the GOP-led investigation into the president.

But even as the majority of House Republicans rally around the inquiry vote, GOP leadership has made a point to indicate that formalizing the inquiry does not mean impeaching the president is inevitable, even as pressure within the party and among the Republican base grows.

“We’re not going to prejudge the outcome of this because we can’t,” Johnson told reporters Tuesday. “It’s not a political calculation. We’re following the law and we are the rule of law team and I’m going to hold to that.”

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, echoed Johnson’s sentiment by telling reporters, “Voting in favor of an impeachment inquiry does not equal impeachment.”

More on the inquiry: Since former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry in September, a trio of committees leading the investigation have interviewed various officials from the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service while also obtaining a mountain of documents and new bank records, including from Biden family members.

Even as Republicans issue new subpoenas and schedule more depositions, including with the president’s brother and son, they still have not uncovered credible evidence that backs up their loftiest claims against Biden. There has only been one hearing related to the inquiry since its launch, where the expert witnesses called by Republicans acknowledged GOP investigators hadn’t yet presented enough evidence to prove the accusations they were leveling.",2023-12-13,2

President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris delivered speeches Saturday from Wilmington, Delaware, after winning the presidency, CNN projects.

If you're just reading in, here's what you need to know:

Biden makes an appeal for unity: He said he was humbled by the trust America had placed in him and reached out to those Americans who did not vote for him. ""I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance,"" he said, adding later in his remarks, ""This is the time to heal in America.""

Biden paid homage to his deep faith: Citing Biblical verses and a popular hymn, Biden said, “And he will raise you up on eagle's wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you just sigh like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand. Now, together on eagle's wings we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do with full hearts and steady hands. With faith in America and each other. With love of country, a thirst for justice. Let us be the nation that we know we can be. A nation united. A nation strengthened. A nation healed. The United States of America, ladies and gentlemen. There's never, never been anything we've tried we've not been able to do.""

Harris noted the significance of her place on the stage: Harris, a senator from California, who will make history as the first woman, the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to become vice president, said, ""While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities."" Harris also thanked Black women, saying they are ""too often overlooked, but so often prove that they are the backbone of our democracy.""

She spoke about her mother and made a nod to suffragettes: She remembered her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who immigrated to the United States from India as a young woman. ""When she came here when was 19, she could not have imagined this moment,"" Harris said. The Vice President-elect also wore a white suit, a nod to suffragettes 100 years after women's constitutional right to vote was guaranteed.

Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from Florida, said the reason she was able to hug her children again after the Jan. 6 insurrection was because of the heroic actions of the officers testifying today, specifically DC Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges.

Hodges is seen in video footage holding a door with his body, preventing rioters from going further into the building. Murphy said she was in a small office with Rep. Kathleen Rice, a Democrat from New York, about 40 feet away from where the officers were.

""We had taken refuge in that office because we thought for sure being in the basement at the heart of the Capitol was the safest place we could be, and it turned out we ended up at the center of the storm,"" Murphy said.

The congresswoman said officers, like Hodges, prevented a tragic situation from becoming even more tragic. While officer Hodges was holding the door, Murphy said other officers were able to get her and Rice out of the office and down the hallway safely.

""Imagine if they had caught the two members of Congress that were just 40 feet from where you all were,"" she said.

""I think it's important for everybody, though, to remember that the main reason rioters didn't harm any members of Congress was because they didn't encounter any members of Congress,"" Murphy added.

She said she could hear officers yelling and struggling to breathe down the hall. During the hearing, Murphy thanked the officers for protecting her.

""I have a 10-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter, and they're the light of my life. And the reason I was able to hug them again was because of the courage that you and your fellow officers showed that day, and so just a really heart felt thank you,"" she said.

When Murphy asked officer Hodges what he was fighting for that day, he said, ""democracy.""",2021-07-27,1

A federal judge on Thursday set a June trial date for Hunter Biden after the president’s son pleaded not guilty to nine tax-related charges in a Los Angeles courtroom.

“I’m kind of keeping you on a tight schedule,” Judge Mark Scarsi said. “We like to move things along.”

The trial is set to begin on June 20, 2024.

Here's what happened in court today: Prosecutor Leo Wise told the court that discovery in the case had already largely been handed over and that some discovery in the Delaware case – where Hunter Biden faces three gun-related charges – will also be used in the case in California.

“It’s a common production,” Wise noted, “coming out of the same investigation.”

Hunter Biden’s attorney Abbe Lowell did not object to the dates set by the judge but noted that dates in the Delaware case have not yet been set.

Lowell said they would be seeking discovery related to how prosecutors changed their minds about striking a plea deal after one collapsed last year over similar charges.

“We had a resolution in this case in the summer of 2023. And then, things happened,” Lowell said. Wise shot back, arguing that he did not believe the situation was “that unusual.”

“Pleas fall apart all the time,” Wise said.

Scarsi also asked the parties to look for case law dealing with congressional interference, noting that he and his clerks could only find one case related to the issue.

Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.",2024-02-16,4

John Floyd, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ father, testified Friday that he taught his daughter to “hide cash” in case she needed it.

“What I told my child from the time she was a child was always have some money,” Floyd said, adding that he told her to always have “six months of cash always.”

Defense attorneys had pushed Willis over why she would keep a prevalence of cash in her home, which she said used to pay Nathan Wade back for various expenses. Floyd’s testimony corroborates Willis’ statements that she was taught to always have cash handy.

“Maybe, and excuse me your honor, I’m not trying to be racist, but it’s a black thing,” Floyd said. “I was trained, and most black folks, they hide cash or they keep cash, and I was trained you always keep some cash.”

“I gave my daughter her first cash box and told her, ‘always keep some cash,’” Floyd said.

Floyd referenced a time he had trouble paying for his meal at a restaurant several years ago to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“I had a American Express credit card and maybe a Visa,” Floyd said, as well as “a lot of what they call traveler’s checks.”

“For whatever reasons the man would not take my American Express credit card,” Floyd said. “So, I pulled out my Visa card, and he wouldn’t take my Visa card. So then I pulled out my traveler’s checks, and he said ‘we don’t take checks.’""

“The bill for my wife at the time … Fani and myself was like $9.95, I had a $10 bill. And I always remember that,” he said.",2024-02-16,4

Several advisers and confidants of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis privately urged her in recent weeks to encourage top prosecutor Nathan Wade voluntarily step aside, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.

Willis is being advised by people inside and outside of the district attorney’s office, though one source said there is a difference of legal opinions about what to do next.

Willis and Wade have so far resisted the push for him to resign from the Georgia election subversion case, a stance that the two reinforced in their defiant testimony Thursday in an Atlanta-area courtroom where they pushed back on allegations that their now-ended romantic relationship created a disqualifying conflict of interest.

CNN previously reported that Willis had no plans to recuse herself from the case after allegations surfaced that she and Wade engaged in an improper romantic relationship. Sources familiar with the situation said prior to Thursday’s hearing that Wade also did not have immediate plans to step away from the case either but acknowledged his future was more uncertain.

Wade is interchangeable and could be replaced without forcing the case to be assigned to another prosecutor's office, multiple sources familiar with the situation stressed before and after he testified on Thursday.

Privately, Wade has told others working on the Georgia election case he does not want to be a distraction, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Raphael Warnock exuded confidence but warned supporters against being complacent in his runoff election with Republican nominee and former football great Herschel Walker.

“There is still a path for Herschel Walker to win this race,” Warnock said after a campaign stop Monday. “If there’s anything I worry about it’s that people will think we don’t need their voice. We do. We need you to show up.”

Warnock was the leading vote-getter in the general election last month, but the contest extended into December since he failed to win a majority. After four weeks of runoff campaigning, Warnock and Democrats are optimistic that he can outlast Walker and secure a full, six-year term.

Such a victory would help solidify Georgia as a purple state after Joe Biden narrowly carried it in 2020 and Warnock and Jon Ossoff won January 2021 runoffs that delivered the president a Democratic Senate.

“We’re working on turnout, turnout, turnout,” Walker said as he barnstormed across northern Georgia at five scheduled rallies on the eve of the election. “A vote for Warnock is a vote for these failed policies. A vote for me is a better coming.”

Tuesday’s race, though, is still expected to be tight, with both parties and allied groups pouring tens of millions into a contest that will shape the balance of power in the Senate over the next two years.

Francis Chung/E&E News/Politico/AP

Conservative Supreme Court justices were hostile on Monday to the ongoing use of race-based affirmative action in college admissions.

The court took nearly five hours to debate affirmative action policies at the University of North Carolina and Harvard.

Based on Monday’s oral arguments, the six conservative justices appear ready to end the use of affirmative action in admissions, overturning a precedent from 1978.

Here are key takeaways from today's oral arguments:

Conservatives say defenders of affirmative action can’t articulate an end point

The conservative wing of the court harped on the lack of clarity around when the need for affirmative action would end. Multiple justices asked Ryan Park, the North Carolina Solicitor General who is defending the UNC admissions program, to elaborate on how to measure that a school has achieved the diversity goals that would render affirmative action unnecessary.

""I don't see how you can say that the program will ever end,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said during a pile-on that also included Justices Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett. ""Your position is that race matters because it's necessary for diversity, which is necessary for the sort of education you want. It's not going to stop mattering at some particular point, you're always going to have to look at race because you say race matters to give us the necessary diversity.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the court will struggle if they are asked to review affirmative action again in 10 years, “if you don’t have something measurable” that shows whether the diversity goals have been achieved.

Thomas questions educational benefit of racial diversity

Justice Clarence Thomas asked all three lawyers arguing in favor of UNC's affirmative action program — Park, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and David Hinojosa, who is representing UNC students defending the program — to explain how racial diversity benefits the educational experience students receive.

“I may be tone deaf when it comes to all these other things that happen on campus, about feeling good and all that,” Thomas said to Hinojosa. “I'm really interested in a simple thing. .. what benefits academically are there to your definition or the diversity that you're asserting?”

When he posed the question to Park, Thomas suggests that Park’s response reminded him of the arguments he heard in favor of segregation.

Jackson says barring all consideration of race invites its own constitutional problems

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson warned that if colleges are prohibited from making any consideration of race, it risks violating the Constitution’s equal protection protections for students who will not be able to present that background in their applications.

“I hear a process in which there's a form that says tell us about yourself and people can put all sorts of things. I'm Catholic, I'm from, you know, Los Angeles, I'm Latina, whatever,” she said. “But now we're — we're entertaining a rule in which some people can say the things they want, about who they are and have that valued in the system. But other people are not going to be able to. Because they won't be able to reveal that they're Latino or African American or whatever. And I'm worried that that creates an inequity in the system.”

Sotomayor points to how states that bar affirmative action have fared

Justice Sonia Sotomayor returned repeatedly to the statistics coming the schools in states that have barred affirmative action.

At one point, she raised those trends to push back on conservatives’ invocation of the 25-year timeline the Supreme Court set, in its 2003 ruling sanctioning the use of race in admissions, for affirmative action programs to no longer be necessary.

“Even your adversary said he didn't see the 25 years as a set deadline. It was an expectation,” Sotomayor said to Park. “What we know we have nine states who have tried it and in each of them as I mentioned earlier, whites have either, white admissions have either, remained the same or increased. And clearly, in some institutions, the numbers for underrepresented groups has fallen dramatically, correct?”

Harvard grilled on allegations of discrimination against Asian applicants

While the justices raised many of the same issues in the Harvard case's hearing as they did in the early UNC lawsuit arguments, Harvard attorney Seth Waxman got a grilling on the specific allegations of discrimination against Asian applicants -- allegations only being brought in the Harvard case.

Alito pressed Waxman extensively on the evidence that Asian applicants received lower personal ratings in the admissions process than other racial groups. Waxman's attempts to emphasize that race was an important factor in very few of the admission decisions prompted Roberts to remark sharply ""So there's only a little racial discrimination in the case?""

Roberts also had a pointed retort in Waxman compared the advantage an applicant might get because of their race to the advantage Harvard would give an oboe player if the school's orchestra was in need of that instrument.",2022-10-31,1

President Joe Biden's public schedule was clear Tuesday as his son Hunter Biden was in a Delaware courtroom pleading not guilty to federal gun charges.

Behind closed doors, the president was expected to place phone calls to foreign leaders, hoping to bolster confidence in continued US support for Ukraine after Congress failed to approve new funding over the weekend, according to people familiar with the matter.

The president's schedule was similarly empty on July 26, the day an expected plea agreement fell apart in the courtroom in Wilmington, Delaware. President Biden was kept abreast of the developments by his lawyers in between policy meetings with advisers. He also taped a podcast interview in which he publicly acknowledged his seventh grandchild — Hunter's daughter with a woman in Arkansas — for the first time.

First lady Jill Biden regularly teaches a class at Northern Virginia Community College on Tuesday mornings. She did not otherwise have any public events.

The White House continues to refer questions about the case to Hunter Biden's personal representatives or the Justice Department.

Hunter Biden hasn't been seen publicly at the White House in several months, but he is known to speak on a near-daily basis with his father. He spent a week in August on vacation with the president and his family at Lake Tahoe, but they were not seen in public together at any point.

Kramer was hired by the Phillips campaign to assist in ballot efforts in New York and Pennsylvania.

In the call, a voice that sounds like the president urges voters not to vote in the January 23 primary and instead to “save” their vote for the November election.

New Hampshire’s attorney general announced earlier this month that the call had been linked to a pair of Texas-based telecommunications companies and said state law enforcement had opened a criminal investigation. Senior US law enforcement officials have also been closely monitoring the incident to determine if a federal crime was committed, a senior US official familiar with the matter told CNN.

Former President Donald Trump’s trial in his election interference case in Washington, DC, is indefinitely postponed during ongoing appeals about presidential immunity.

But the judge who will oversee the trial has hinted at a quick timetable once the case returns to her jurisdiction. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has suggested in the past that there are about three months left of pre-trial work to be done before a trial could start.

Chutkan originally set the trial to begin on March 4 but delayed that date until the matter of whether Trump should be immune from prosecution is settled by appeals courts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments on the issue in April and is expected to issue a ruling by the end of the term in June.

The judge made clear in her order delaying the March trial date that she would revisit the timetable when those appeals are settled, and only then will new deadlines or trial dates be made official.

Here's what to know about the timing of this trial:

Who decides when a trial happens? This is entirely up to the courts. The judge overseeing the trial can take into consideration arguments from prosecutors and defense teams about when a trial can happen, but it’s the judge’s call at the end of the day.

Would Election Day put a fall trial on hold? Almost certainly no. Nothing on a political calendar would block a trial from happening. Trump’s team has tried to claim that the cases against him are “election interference” and repeatedly argued in court he should not face a jury while he is campaigning for president, but multiple judges overseeing his cases have rejected this idea. Chutkan previously told Trump’s lawyers his desire to conduct a campaign would have to yield in some ways to the needs of the justice system. She called his campaign a “day job” at an early hearing.

Could Trump still go to trial on federal 2020 election charges before the election? Yes. It’s possible, and even likely, that if the Supreme Court were to green-light a trial by the end of the court’s term in June, Trump would go to trial before the election. In that scenario, Chutkan could set the trial for a few weeks out once the immunity question is resolved. She has already worked through many of the pretrial issues in the case, with only a few still in limbo while the appeals have been ongoing.

Trump has no other ability to muster additional appeals to slow down this case before trial. And with only four counts against him as a sole defendant, it wouldn’t be out of line for the DC District Court to hold Trump’s trial about a year after he was initially charged, as the court does with many of its criminal defendants. If the Supreme Court agrees with Trump on presidential immunity, however, the case against him could be dismissed.",2024-03-01,7

Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to convince Judge Aileen Cannon that she will need to hold a hearing on their request for more discovery from several agencies and the White House.

Their request depends on an argument that officials from those agencies were advising prosecutors on prosecutorial decisions that essentially make them members of the prosecution team.

Cannon seemed open to the idea of holding a hearing, but pressed Trump attorney Emil Bove on what such a hearing would focus on and how it would work. Bove pointed to several examples of what he said was collaboration between multiple government agencies like the National Archives and the White House.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.",2024-03-01,7

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9. The trial is currently set to start in May.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Michigan state Rep. Alabas Farhat is voting ""uncommitted"" in today's primary to send a message to President Joe Biden to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and urge him to live up to his campaign promises from 2020.

""I want to make it clear that today's vote is an appeal to the White House, it is an appeal to President Biden to be the leader that we know he can, a leader that he promised the nation he would be in 2020, when he campaigned saying that he was going to restore dignity and humanity to the White House,"" the Democratic representative from Michigan's 3rd District told CNN.

They're watching ""their loved ones dying, children starving to death and they're hearing the screams of parents who are holding their children, their lifeless children,"" he said. He said the coalition wants to see an effort toward restoring humanitarian aid and lasting peace.

Farhat added that the push to vote uncommitted during the primary will probably not impact Biden winning, but those involved are building a diverse coalition to show the White House that there is a unified message calling for a ceasefire.

""The message though is that a plurality of voters, Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Gen Z voters are coming together — African American voters are coming together in a coalition to tell the president that, 'Hey, we want — we want to see you call for the ceasefire.

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley offered harsh criticism of former President Donald Trump, saying if he clinches the GOP nomination it “is like suicide for our country.”

“This may be his survival mode to pay his legal fees and get out of some sort of legal peril, but this is like suicide for our country. We’ve got to realize that if we don’t have someone who can win a general election, all we are doing is caving to the socialist left,” Haley said during an interview with the Wall Street Journal.

When making the case that he can’t win a general election, Haley has often pointed to Trump’s mounting legal troubles, which include 91 criminal charges for matters surrounding his handling of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Following Trump's $355 million civil fraud verdict earlier this month, Haley claimed the RNC could possibly become the ""piggy bank"" funding the former president’s legal fees.

Despite losing in four states to Trump, Haley has doubled down on questioning his electability. During an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan on Tuesday morning, the former South Carolina governor highlighted that while the former president won in early states, “he did not get 40% of the Republican primary vote.”

Two of the Big Three companies, GM and Chrysler, went bankrupt in 2009 and needed federal bailouts to survive.

That took a bite not only out of employment, but out of auto wages, as the United Auto Workers union agreed to deep concessions, including a lower tier of wages, to help keep all three companies alive. But that helped drag down wages in the state overall.

The state’s median household income was higher than the national average until 2000, according to the Growing Michigan Together Council, a group formed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to develop solutions to Michigan’s challenges. The state’s median income declined relative to the US level over the past five decades.

Today, the median household income in the state was just under $67,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau.

However, following a six-week strike last fall at GM, Ford and Stellantis, the United Auto Workers union won immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members. Pay for members is expected to rise more than 30% during the life of the contract, which expires in 2028.

While jobs in the state’s auto and parts plants have stabilized in recent years, jobs in the manufacturing sector overall have edged up by 4.5% since the end of 2020. But that still hasn’t recaptured jobs lost in that sector during the first year of the pandemic. Overall employment in the state in December was up 9.6% from the end of 2020, but still off 0.5% from December of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic.

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal dismissed concerns over the potential weakness of President Joe Biden’s electoral coalition — which has faced challenges amid concerns from Arab Americans and progressives over the administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

""I think the Biden coalition is strong, alive and well and focused on the basic accomplishments of this administration, as it will be on election day.

Blumenthal’s emphasis on a potential pause in the fighting in Gaza, which Biden said could possibly be reached as early as the end of this upcoming weekend, illustrates the ongoing political ramifications of the war.

Blumenthal also added that he’s ""very concerned"" about a government shutdown, pointing to its possible catastrophic consequences. ""It takes people focus on the real end game here which is not unnecessary and frivolous riders to prove a point or make a political stunt,"" he said.",2024-02-27,5

It was also noticeably less full.

Tension filled the courtroom earlier in the day as Trump’s lawyers squared off in a heated debate with Judge Arthur Engoron over the tedious questioning style of Trump attorney Jesus Suarez, who methodically questioned the former president's long-time accountant Donald Bender about his yearly financial statements for the company.

Suarez argued he had to go through all the years because ""It’s important"" to their case.

At one point, Engoron pounded the bench, exclaiming, “This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous,” scolding Trump’s attorney for the repetitive questioning the had already ordered Suarez to stop.

“You’re not going to get away with this,” Engoron said looking straight at Suarez.

Trump sat with his arms crossed during these exchanges, often shaking his head “No” in reaction to the judge.

“All I’m asking is that you lump things together so that we don't waste time.” “Let’s not waste time I’m just being logical here,"" the judge said.

Suarez peppered Bender, reviewing asset after asset, and asking him to confirm the accountant had ample time yet still found no issues with each line item of the spreadsheets — an attempt to attack Bender’s credibility.

Bender repeatedly confirmed he found no issues and maintained that his duty was only to compile the statements, not check the underlying data for truthfulness.

After the lunch break, Bender’s testimony was paused, allowing for the second witness to take the stand for the attorney general’s office.

Camron Harris, an audit partner for Whitley Penn, testified for about 90 minutes about his firm’s work for the Trump organization in 2021.

Whitley Penn compiled statements of financial condition for Donald Trump’s revocable trust for his time in office, along with the Trump Organization entities.

Assistant Attorney General Sherief Gaber reviewed disclaimers in the Whitley Penn engagement letter and statements signed by Trump’s sons, acknowledging that Whitley Penn as the accountant is not responsible for verifying any information shared by the Trump Organization.

Harris said the firm's job was to format the data appropriately, a similar response to Bender’s testimony about compiling statements of financial condition.

The accounting firm expressed in disclaimers that the Trump Organization is responsible for the accuracy of the supporting data in the financial statements.

Harris said he dealt with Eric Trump, who was president of the Trump Organization at the time, but also said he never spoke to Eric Trump specifically about the statements.

The attorney general's lawyer showed a transcript excerpt from a deposition with Harris.

Trump attorney Clifford Robert interrupted and asked Gaber to read a question he had skipped over, which asked, ""Did you have any meeting with either Don Jr. or Eric with respect to the SOFCs?"" ""Not specifically. Not specifically in relation to the SOCFs—yeah statement of condition,"" Harris answered in the transcript.

During this exchange, Trump attorneys and Eric Trump who was in the courtroom nodded along and Trump’s son looked back at the press in the galley.

Trump’s attorneys did not cross-examine Harris but reserved the right to call him during the defense case.

When Bender resumed cross-examination late in the afternoon, Suarez seemed to pare down his questioning enough to avoid any further admonishment from the judge.

Bender is expected to continue cross-examination Thursday morning, his fourth day on the stand. Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney may also testify Thursday.",2023-10-04,2

Nancy Mace of South Carolina: If you vote to oust McCarthy, the party might not be willing to help raise money for your race.

The warning to Mace, which was described by a source familiar with the conversation, is a sign of just how seriously the speaker drama has rankled the Republican party, with money often used as a powerful carrot – or stick – in Washington.

Yet Mace, a Republican who could face a competitive race and will need a well-funded campaign war chest to win reelection, ultimately joined seven other GOP lawmakers and all Democrats to sink McCarthy. And it’s not the only repercussion she could now be facing for her career-defining moment of defiance: Sources told CNN that there’s discussion among members on the Republican Governance Group about voting to kick her out of the moderate-leaning group.

It’s just one of many examples of the fallout from Tuesday’s stunning vote to remove the sitting speaker, which has reverberated through both sides of the Capitol and left a bitterly divided GOP scrambling to pick up the pieces. Much of the furor is directed at Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, the ringleader of the McCarthy rebellion. But Republicans are also turning their fire on their Democratic colleagues as well, furious that they sided with Gaetz to throw the House into chaos and let McCarthy be punished for funding the government with their votes.

And it all comes as a GOP leadership scramble to succeed McCarthy has begun to take shape, even as rank-and-file Republicans warn the speaker candidates that there is ample work that must be done to repair the frayed relations within their badly divided conference.

Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a North Dakota Republican and a close McCarthy ally, said there are a “lot of raw nerves” and that the next speaker candidates must make clear that they will “never” allow a single GOP member to oust a sitting speaker again.

“The next speaker better figure out how to negotiate with the exotics before you become speaker because you’re sure as hell gonna have to do it after you’re speaker,” Armstrong said.

“This isn’t a normal election,” he said of the speaker’s race. “And I think too many people are treating it like one.”

The high-stakes drama has not only sparked threats to remove GOP colleagues from the conference but also put key bipartisan working relationships in jeopardy ahead of another looming government funding deadline and prompted serious internal conversations about overhauling the House rules, further complicating any candidates’ bid to win the gavel.

“There was a meeting last night, as you may know, of Republicans and that room would have devolved into I think physical attacks on one another if people stayed in there for a long period of time,” said Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, a McCarthy ally. “People are mad … It is justified for them to be frustrated by what happened yesterday.”

South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects.

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",2024-02-03,1

Ahead of Tuesday's Nevada primary, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s campaign outlined their reasoning behind participating in the state’s primary election instead of the party-run GOP caucuses on Thursday.

“We have not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada. We aren't going to pay $55,000 to a Trump entity to participate in a process that is rigged for Trump. Nevada is not and has never been our focus. I’m truly not sure what the Trump team is up to out there, but they seem pretty spun up about it,” Haley’s campaign manager Betsy Ankney said during a press call on Monday.

More on the dueling GOP contests: While there will be a GOP primary Tuesday, Republicans have chosen to award their delegates via the caucuses, and the dueling contests have caused some confusion among Nevada voters.

Some Republican presidential contenders, including Haley, filed to run in the primary. Former President Donald Trump chose not to appear on the primary ballot, opting instead to appear on the GOP caucus ballot, which effectively guarantees his victory.

Only one Cabinet official has previously been impeached in American history: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876.

Here are key things to know about the upcoming vote:

What Republicans are saying: House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar. The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

Tight margin: But Republicans can only lose three votes in their razor-thin majority if all lawmakers are present, and a handful of lawmakers have not indicated how they plan to vote. GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado announced in an op-ed that he would not vote to impeach Mayorkas. GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California wrote on X on Tuesday he also will vote against impeaching the DHS secretary. House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee, who has led the impeachment effort, has been meeting with some of the remaining GOP holdouts in the lead up to the vote, according to GOP sources.

What happens after the vote: Even if Mayorkas is impeached in the House, it is highly unlikely that he will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond if Mayorkas is impeached: Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

What Mayorkas is saying: Mayorkas – whom the department said is meeting with staff in Mountain View, California, on Tuesday, to discuss cybersecurity and artificial intelligence – sent a letter to House Republicans to defend his record in public service. “My reverence for law enforcement was instilled in me by my parents, who brought me to this country to escape the Communist takeover of Cuba and allow me the freedoms and opportunity that our democracy provides,” Mayorkas said. The Department of Homeland Security has also blasted House Republicans over its upcoming committee vote, calling it a “farce” and “distraction from other vital national security priorities.”

The Senate is considering a border deal: While Republicans in the House argue that the remedy for fixing the crisis at the southern border is to impeach Mayorkas and pressure President Joe Biden to take more executive action, their counterparts in the Senate have worked with their Democratic colleagues to unveil a border deal that would make long-anticipated changes to immigration law.

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

Matt Rourke/AP

Donald Trump’s New Hampshire triumph puts him on a GOP primary tier few, if any, Republicans have reached. Unofficial returns at time of publication have the former president at about 55% of the vote.

He’s only the second nonincumbent Republican to win a majority of the GOP primary vote in New Hampshire in the modern era. The only other was Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Trump’s 55% surpasses Reagan’s 50.2%. He is also just the second nonincumbent Republican to win the New Hampshire primary twice in the modern era. The other Republican was John McCain.

The fact that Trump was able to win both Iowa and New Hampshire is quite unusual. No other nonincumbent Republican has ever done it. Mitt Romney in 2012 came the closest (winning New Hampshire but losing Iowa by 24 votes) – and he took less than 40% in New Hampshire and under 25% of the vote in Iowa.

Trump’s ability to win Iowa and New Hampshire with such ease tells you how strong his candidacy is among Republicans. He appeals to different parts of the party, as evidenced by the fact that he succeeded in two very different contests in two fairly different states:

Iowa is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists, dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. Few non-Republicans participate.

is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists, dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. Few non-Republicans participate. New Hampshire sees a relatively high turnout primary that openly invites registered independents (or undeclared voters). The Granite State voters are more moderate, far less religious and wealthier than Iowa's.

Put another way, New Hampshire should have been a far worse state for Trump. His biggest backers look a lot more like the Iowa electorate than New Hampshire voters: conservatives, religious Republicans and Republicans of more modest financial means.

But none of that stopped Trump from pulling in the largest share of the vote for an non-incumbent in New Hampshire GOP primary history. It seems quite plausible at this point that Trump may pull off the ultimate historic GOP primary win: becoming the first non-incumbent Republican to go undefeated in all 50 states during the primary season.",2024-01-25,1

One of the central questions of the 2024 campaign is whether President Joe Biden can make voters see the November election as a stark choice against Donald Trump — or whether the race merely becomes a referendum on policies of the Biden administration.

A critical test of that balance comes tonight — at least for Biden — when his foreign policy faces the scrutiny at the ballot box from Michigan voters. But even as the Biden campaign and the White House keep a close eye on the number of people who vote “uncommitted,” advisers acknowledge an even bigger challenge is motivating those who didn’t vote at all today.

The Democratic contest was not competitive, so it’s difficult to read too much into the turnout, but one prominent Detroit pastor said today he worries about the overall disinterest in the race among younger voters and many Black voters: “Apathetic voters don’t go out and vote uncommitted – they just stay home.”",2024-02-29,11

Junfu Han/Detroit Free Press/USA Today Network

A Michigan court has affirmed the removal of Kristina Karamo as the state’s Republican Party chair, in a move that could settle a bitter leadership dispute just days before the party’s convention this weekend.

In a preliminary injunction issued Tuesday, Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi said Karamo was properly removed from her position on January 6, when Michigan’s GOP state committee voted to oust her, and that any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.”

Tuesday’s ruling, a copy of which was published by NBC News, also prevents Karamo from representing herself as chair of the Michigan Republican State Committee or conducting business on behalf of the party.

Tuesday’s development was a victory for Pete Hoekstra, a former ambassador and representative who has been recognized by the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump as the rightful chair of the Michigan Republican Party.

The Michigan GOP is set to hold its convention on Saturday, when it will allocate the state’s delegates for the Republican National Convention. Karamo had planned a rival convention, potentially complicating the process.

CNN previously reported that under Karamo’s leadership, the Michigan GOP suffered from internal strife and lackluster finances. A CNN investigation published in late 2023 found the party’s financial problems had become so bad that an internal report revealed the state party had a net income of just $71,000 over a nine-month period that ended with it $600,000 in debt.",2024-02-29,11

As President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump head to Texas, a federal judge in Austin has ordered the state government to suspend enforcement of a controversial law that would allow state law enforcement agents to arrest and detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally.

“If allowed to procced, SB 4 could open the door to each state passing its own version of immigration laws,” Judge David Alan Ezra wrote, granting a preliminary injunction against the law.

The judge rejected the state’s argument that the current influx of migrants across the southern border is an “invasion” that Texas has the right to stop unilaterally. “SB 4 threatens the fundamental notion that the United States must regulate immigration with one voice,” Ezra wrote.

Without action from the court, the law was set to go into effect on Tuesday. Plaintiffs include the federal government and El Paso County, which claims enforcing the law would strain its jail system with thousands of new arrests.

“El Paso County applauds the court’s clear confirmation today that immigration policies rest solely under Federal jurisdiction, and the state of Texas’ interference with the U.S. Constitution will not be tolerated,” said Iliana Holguin, a commissioner for El Paso County.

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.",2024-02-29,11

In 2020, Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American activist and longtime Michigan Democrat, backed Joe Biden for president. But like many Arab Americans, she feels betrayed by his response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the rising civilian death toll. Biden would need to curtail US military aid to Israel and call for a permanent ceasefire before she could even consider supporting him in November, she said.

And as for Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Michigan, she’s leading the charge to convince Democrats to vote “uncommitted.” Elabed is the effort’s campaign manager and the sister of Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman in Congress.

The Listen to Michigan campaign was launched less than three weeks ago by Elabed and other Arab American activists in the Wolverine State. It’s a last-minute effort to send a “clear, sharp message” to Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party to address the concerns of the coalition that helped him win in 2020, Elabed said.

Since its launch, the effort has been endorsed by progressive groups such as Our Revolution and more than three dozen current and former state and local leaders, including Tlaib and former US Rep. Andy Levin. Volunteers have contacted more than 100,000 voters in the state, according to organizers.

The president’s reelection campaign has responded to the Listen to Michigan effort by emphasizing Biden’s domestic accomplishments, framing the general election as a binary choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump and stressing that the administration is listening to people’s concerns and open to future conversations.

Why this matters: If thousands of Michigan Democrats vote uncommitted Tuesday, it would be the clearest sign yet that Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza could cost him critical votes in November.

The conservative group, which pledged to back a single contender in the GOP presidential primary for the first time in its history, deployed its vast resources and standing army of activists on behalf of the former United Nations ambassador.

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

McHenry signaled the two sides are trading legislative text as they go along instead of just toplines, so they’re not starting from scratch when they go to write the actual bill.

Bill Hennessy

In a hearing Friday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan set the tone for how she will preside over the 2020 election subversion case against former President Donald Trump.

Chutkan kicked off the hearing – the first in the case before her and one that took place in her courtroom at DC federal courthouse – noting that while Trump’s rights as a criminal defendant would be protected, his First Amendment right to free speech was “not absolute.”

The hearing focused on what limits would be placed on how the former president can handle the evidence prosecutors will be turning over to him.

“In a criminal case such as this one, the defendant’s free speech is subject to the rules,” she said.

The judge closed the hearing with a promise that the case would advance like any normal proceeding in the criminal justice system, but warned that the more “inflammatory” statements were made by a party, the quicker she would need to move toward a trial to preserve a fair jury.

“It is a bedrock principle of the judicial process in this country,” she said, while quoting precedent, “that legal trials are not like elections, to be won through the use of the meeting hall, the radio and the newspaper.”

“This case is no exception,” she said.

Over the course of the proceedings, she expressed some skepticism to the arguments made by the office of special counsel Jack Smith, siding with Trump on at least a few matters related to the protective order over evidence that was the subject of Friday’s hearing. Addressing a submission from the government that she refused to let be filed under seal, she also emphasized a need for public transparency into the docket.

The hearing, roughly an hour and 40 minutes long, was the first in the case before Chutkan. She has already shown a habit of responding quickly and tersely on the docket to debates between the parties over scheduling. An Obama appointee and former public defender who has overseen several cases regarding the events of January 6, 2021, Chutkan has been outspoken about the harm the US Capitol attack caused to American democracy.

Chutkan later issued a protective order barring Trump from publicly disclosing sensitive information in the case.

Trump pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election last week, and the judge cautioned lawyers for Trump, who did not attend the hearing, about any public statements by their client that could possibly intimidate of witnesses.

Evan Vucci/AP

On any other week, special counsel Robert Hur's writing that President Joe Biden could be perceived as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" would have been a damning portrait of a sitting president.

For Biden, however, the special counsel's comments about his memory came at an even more inopportune moment. On three separate occasions this week, Biden has confused the names of European leaders who died years ago with those who more recently served in office, raising more questions about his mental recall.

In those episodes, Biden was describing an international summit in 2021. He described speaking with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, and French President Francois Mitterrand, who died in 1996.

Only about 45 minutes before the report was released publicly, the White House was working to downplay to slip-ups, saying it’s common for people to misspeak.

“Many people, elected officials…they can misspeak sometimes,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, citing recent examples from House Speaker Mike Johnson and TV host Sean Hannity.

She said in meetings, she had never witnessed Biden confuse names.

Yet the picture Hur painted of Biden in the report went well beyond the occasional mistaken name. He said in interviews, the president did not remember the years he was vice president or when his son Beau died.

Immediately after the report was released, White House officials and Biden's personal lawyer forcefully rejected what they said were inappropriate and incorrect statements about his memory.",2024-02-08,6

Unlike campaign events – which I usually cover – inside the Supreme Court, no electronics are allowed. Just pen and paper.

Even the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

From where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.

While Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.

You cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Mitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply...”

Kagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.

Another moment of laughter surrounded the order of specific questions. Kagan jumped in as Jackson pivoted to another point about the officer/office debate: “Could we — is that OK if we do this and then do that? Will there be an opportunity to do officer stuff or should we–?”

President Joe Biden on Thursday touted his cooperation in special counsel Robert Hur’s probe, drawing a sharp contrast with how his predecessor has treated a similar probe.

In a statement Thursday, Biden said that he was “pleased” that the special counsel’s report into his handling of classified documents did not include any charges. The president also added that this was “an exhaustive investigation” that went back more than 40 years.

And in a comment that will draw comparison to Donald Trump’s alleged attempts to withhold classified documents after he left office, Biden said his participation in Hur’s investigation was what Americans deserved.

“I just believed that’s what I owed the American people so they could know no charges would be brought and the matter closed,” Biden said.

Hur noted in his report there were distinctions between Trump and Biden's classified documents cases. Among them is the fact that the National Archives repeatedly tried and failed to get back documents in Trump’s possession. At one point, the FBI secured a search warrant to search his Florida estate.

Biden’s attorneys, on the other hand, notified the National Archives of the materials found in his possession. Those documents were discovered on November 2, just six days before the midterm elections, but the president’s attorneys only publicly acknowledged the discovery of the documents on November 7 — when news reports about the discovery broke.

Biden’s statement added, “I was pleased to see they reached the conclusion I believed all along they would reach – that there would be no charges brought in this case and the matter is now closed. This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s when I was a young Senator.”

The president also sought to explain the circumstances surrounding his interviews with the special counsel’s team, saying they were five hours long over the course of two days right after Israel had been attacked on October 7.

“I was so determined to give the Special Counsel what they needed that I went forward with five hours of in-person interviews over two days on October 8th and 9th of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked on October 7th and I was in the middle of handling an international crisis,” Biden said.

Biden concluded the statement by saying, “I take these issues seriously and no one has ever questioned that.”",2024-02-08,6

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

Introduces a new process in which US Citizenship and Immigration Services would decide an asylum claim without it going through the immigration court system. The process doesn’t apply to unaccompanied migrant children.

The split contests are the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in their new lineup.

Republicans opposed an earlier Michigan primary, which violated Republican National Committee rules limiting which states can hold contests before March 1. After Democrats, who control the legislature and the governor’s office, moved the Michigan primary to February 27 despite the Republican opposition, the RNC and the Michigan GOP came up with the hybrid model.

News 12 Long Island

Democratic former Rep. Tom Suozzi and Republican Nassau County legislator Mazi Melesa Pilip squared off Thursday night in the first and only debate of their race to replace disgraced former Rep. George Santos — a heated affair that underscored the contest’s national stakes.

Santos himself was largely an afterthought as issues such as immigration and abortion – which have roiled New York’s 3rd Congressional District along with the rest of the country – dominated the debate.

The pair, along with News 12 anchor Rich Barrabi and the town hall-style audience, steered clear of the Santos fiasco that gripped the district for the better part of last year.

Here are the main takeaways:

Immigration takes center stage: Pilip accused Suozzi of “opening the border” and demanded that he “own” the issue, pointing to his past criticism of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and support for sanctuary cities.

Suozzi, a moderate Democrat and former member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, rejected the charge, accusing Pilip of misleading the public about his record – which included a bipartisan immigration reform attempt with former GOP Rep. Peter King – and deriding her as a big talker with no coherent plan to fix the problem.

Suozzi touts his brand: Suozzi has held office on Long Island for most of the three decades since he was first elected mayor of Glen Cove, on Long Island’s North Shore, in 1993. During the debate, he frequently questioned Pilip’s qualifications and ability to make legislation move on Capitol Hill while also leaning on his well-honed brand to fend off a flurry of attacks from Pilip, who has sought to paint him as a leftist.

Pilip at times became frustrated, and at one point, during an exchange over abortion, took a step toward Suozzi’s lectern. The Democrat responded with a deep-cut New York political reference – joking that she was channeling former Senate candidate Rick Lazio, who infamously infringed on then-candidate Hillary Clinton’s turf during a 2000 campaign debate.

Questions about abortion: Another fiery exchange between the candidates came on the issue of abortion. Pilip accused Suozzi of lying about her stance and Suozzi pushed her to answer whether she’d vote to codify abortion rights protections.

What about George?: Pilip, who had initially endorsed Santos and later called for his resignation, acknowledged that the Santos scandal was “frustrating” and said that the former congressman “lied to all of us.” She swore to the accuracy of her resume, while Suozzi insisted he’s an “open book” and has been “examined over and over again.”

Suozzi, however, used the opportunity to criticize Pilip for not participating in more debates, as this was their first, arguing that debates provide voters a chance to “fully vet the candidates and understand what they stand for, clear as day.”

The craft, described by US intelligence as a surveillance balloon, presented a comparatively low-tech, modest security threat compared to the multilayered espionage, economic, cyber, military and geopolitical rivalry escalating every day.

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

(Doug Mills/Pool/Reuters)

Former White House counsel Pat Cipollone testified for eight hours in front of the House Jan. 6 Committee on Friday in a closed-door interview. Here are some key moments of his testimony played at the committee's seventh hearing on Tuesday.

He did not think there was sufficient evidence of election fraud: In his testimony, Cipollone said he agreed with former Attorney General Bill Barr, who concluded there was insufficient evidence of election fraud. He recounted former chief of staff Mark Meadows saying in November 2020 that then-President Trump should have conceded, to which he said he agreed. Jason Miller, a former senior adviser to Trump, told the committee that Cipollone called John Eastman's theory to overturn the election ""nutty."" Cipollone did not refute this statement.

He was verbally attacked during the Dec. 18, 2020 meeting at the White House. Cipollone told the committee he walked into the Dec.18 meeting attended by Trump, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, none of which, he said, he was ""happy to see.""

The meeting, which lasted six hours, was described as “unhinged” by former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson after hearing screaming coming from the West Wing. Ideas circulated about overturning the election including Flynn's suggestion to invoke martial law and inspection of voting machines.

“I don’t think any of these people were providing the President with good advice,” Cipollone told the committee.

After asking where the evidence was for claims of voter fraud, Cipollone said that he and Meadows were verbally attacked for questioning where the evidence for Trump’s falsely claimed victory came from. Cipollone told the committee the group responded with “general disregard for wanting to back up claims with facts.”

In addition to floating claims of voter fraud and plots to overturn the election, Cipollone described his opposition to Trump’s suggestion of naming Powell as a special counsel to investigate voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""I was vehemently opposed — I didn't think she should be appointed to anything,"" Cipollone told the committee during his closed-door interview, according to a video clip from that meeting played Tuesday.

He thought it was a “terrible idea” for the President to follow a plan to seize election machines: A proposal for the federal government to seize election machines was ""a terrible idea,"" Cipollone told the committee.",2022-07-12,1

Jason Murray, the attorney representing a group of Colorado voters challenging Donald Trump’s eligibility for the 2024 ballot at the Supreme Court, finished his arguments after nearly an hour.

Here's they key moment to know about:

Justices focused on ballot eligibility over January 6: Murray argued the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol was unprecedented and rose to the level of an insurrection, but many of the justices focused on issues in this case that would take them away from the facts of the attack, such as how and if states determine ballot eligibility.

Much of the questioning of Trump's attorney Jonathan Mitchell also revolved around similar sweeping questions of state power and how the 14th Amendment could allow for Colorado to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot.

History of 14th amendment: Chief Justice John Roberts suggested one of the main arguments Murray raised was “at war” with the history of the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist ban at center in the case.

“The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Roberts said. “On the other hand, it augmented federal power.”

Justices were concerned about a single state's power: Several justices signaled their skepticism over whether a single state should have the power to decide what candidates can be on the ballot for a national election. “Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens but also for the nation,” Justice Elena Kagan asked, saying that “seems quite extraordinary.”

Justice Amy Coney Barrett echoed the concerns, adding: “It just doesn’t seem like a state call.”

In response, Murray argued that each state would still have the ability to determine what appears on their own ballots, despite what officials in another state might decide.",2024-02-09,15

Norma Anderson, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to disqualify Donald Trump from office, is a lifelong Republican who has had a storied political career, including stints as the first-ever woman majority leader in both chambers of the Colorado legislature.

“I’m an old-fashioned Republican that believes in strong defense, supporting business, and helping those who don’t know how to help themselves, and less government, and a fair tax base,” Anderson said.

Here are some highlights of her career:

She spent 12 years in the statehouse , before having to leave due to term limits. While there, from 1997 to 1998, she was the majority leader of the lower chamber. After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003.

After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003. Her record: While serving in the Colorado statehouse, Anderson helped enact legislation to improve child literacy and lower the cost of in-state colleges and established a home nursing program with funds from a landmark lawsuit against the large tobacco companies.

Battling Trump – especially in court – comes with acclaim in some circles, and vitriol in others. Anderson said she has received a lot of support from friends and family, except for one or two holdouts who are still die-hard Trump supporters. She said most of her friends weren’t surprised that she got involved in the case.

“I was born four months before FDR was elected,” Anderson said. “I’ve lived through a lot of presidents. Some I liked, some I didn’t. But not one of them caused an insurrection, until Donald Trump.”

Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images

Former President Donald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell concluded his initial arguments before the Supreme Court justices after nearly an hour.

Here are some of the key things that happened:

Power of states: Several of the justices from both ideological sides pressed the Trump lawyer about stripping states of their ability to exclude candidates from power, including whether an “admitted insurrectionist” could be removed from the ballot.

Mitchell argued that it was the role of Congress to determine whether someone should be disqualified — so even if a person admits to being an insurrectionist, states have no basis to act. ""Even if the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist, Section 3 (of the 14th Amendment) still allows the candidate to run for office, and even win election for office, and then see whether Congress lifts that disability after the election,"" Mitchell said in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts.

The role of Congress: Mitchell argued that Colorado's decision to remove Trump from the ballot was improper because, among other reasons, the state disqualified Trump before Congress explicitly gave it the power to do that.

The debate over the term ""officer"": The justices pressed Mitchell over whether the framers of the 14th Amendment believed the president is an “officer of” the United States, and therefore subject to the “insurrectionist ban” under Section 3. The argument is a central focus of the former president’s legal team, which believes that when the amendment’s framers wrote “officer,” they meant lower federal officials appointed by the president – not the president himself.

That discussion led to this particularly intense exchange:

“For an insurrection, there needs to be an organized, concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence,” Mitchell said.

“A chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection?” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked.

Mitchell responded: “This was a riot. It was not an insurrection.”

After turning several recent trials and court hearings into campaign stops, Donald Trump is not expected to be in the room when the highest court in the land takes up the question of his ballot eligibility, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN.

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

While many legal experts believe Trump could prevail on the ballot challenges issue, his appearance could be considered disruptive to the normally staid and above-the-fray decorum of the Supreme Court.

Trump and his team have treated various court appearances as opportunities for him to cry “election interference,” call out who he deems “Trump-hating” judges and attack the system as rigged “political persecution.” His presence and the attendant

The Supreme Court appears poised to back former President Donald Trump and fend off a blockbuster challenge to his eligibility to appear on Colorado’s ballot as a presidential candidate in 2024, a move that would extract the justices from one of the most politically fraught appeals in the court’s history.

If Trump is pulled off the ballot in Colorado, Chief Justice John Roberts predicted that other states would eventually attempt to knock other candidates off the ballot. That, he signaled, would be inconsistent with the purpose and history of the 14th Amendment.

“It’ll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,” Roberts said. “That’s a pretty daunting consequence.”

At issue is a provision in the 14th Amendment that bars certain public officials from serving in the government again if they took part in an insurrection. The six Republican and independent voters from Colorado who challenged Trump say his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol makes him ineligible under that “insurrection ban.”

A majority of the conservative justices on the court posed tough questions to the lawyers representing the voters -- including whether the insurrection ban can be enforced without a law first passed by Congress – though it was unclear which route the court might take.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed the attorneys about a 19th century decision from a lower court that suggested it was congress, not states, that must act first on enforcing an insurrection ban.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, on the other hand, stressed the idea that the ban only applies to serving in office – not necessarily running for office.

The amendment’s key provision, Section 3, says in part: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”",2024-02-09,15

They were talking about Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies extremism. He testified in November in Denver District Court about Trump’s history of embracing of far-right extremists how those militant groups interpreted his incendiary rhetoric on the morning of January 6, immediately proceeding the violent storming of the US Capitol.

Simi’s testimony ended up being influential to the Colorado Supreme Court’s eventual decision to bar Trump from the ballot. But Alito pressed lawyer Jason Murray on whether other states might draw different conclusions, if they were to vet Trump’s actions on January 6. He suggested that other states might not even consider Simi as an expert.

The questioning was yet another example of how the justices appear to be skeptical of the effort to bar Trump from the ballot.

Here’s CNN’s coverage from when Simi testified at the trial:

Trump was often “using language with a wink and a nod,” Simi said, but members of these extremist groups consistently interpreted his comments as a “clarion call” toward “anger, resentment and mobilization.” This ramped up in summer 2020 as Trump began claiming he was being cheated in the presidential election, Simi said.

Eric Olson, an attorney for the Colorado challengers, played clips from Trump’s January 6 speech, where he urged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” so they could “save” the country (Though, at times, he also said they should do so peacefully.)

Right-wing extremists understood those words as “a call to violence,” Simi testified.

""Within far-right extremist culture, fighting is meant to be taken literally … especially within the context as it’s laid out, that these threats are imminent, and that you’re going to lose your country. Then, fighting would be understood as requiring violent action.”

The relationship between Trump and far-right extremists is “unprecedented,” Simi said.

“Far-right extremists really were galvanized by his candidacy starting in 2015,” Simi said. “And a relationship really emerged between Donald Trump and far-right extremists, with far-right extremists really seeing him as speaking their language, and really addressing many of their key grievances.",2024-02-09,15

Unlike campaign events – which I usually cover – inside the Supreme Court, no electronics are allowed. Just pen and paper.

Even the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out during the hearing Thursday that several state-level officials have been barred in the past from holding public office under the 14th Amendment.

“History proves a lot to me and to my colleagues,” Sotomayor said, adding that “there's a whole lot of examples of states relying on Section 3 to disqualify insurrectionists for state offices.”

According to the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, at least eight public officials have been barred from public office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment since its ratification in 1868.

Most recently, convicted January 6 rioter and Cowboys for Trump founder Couy Griffin was removed from his elected position as a county commissioner in New Mexico for his role in the US Capitol attack.

Other individuals removed from office, according to CREW, include a state solicitor who served in the Confederate army, a senator from North Carolina who served in the Confederate army, and a Wisconsin representative who was convicted of charges under the espionage act.

Remember: The 14th Amendment says Americans who take an oath to uphold the Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection” are disqualified from holding future public office.

The amendment’s key provision, Section 3, says in part: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”

However, the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban. And there is an open legal debate over how some of the terms in the vague provision should be defined. For instance, the amendment doesn’t explain what level of political violence is tantamount to “insurrection.”",2024-02-09,15

The US Supreme Court is reviewing a decision from the Colorado Supreme Court, which said in a landmark 4-3 ruling in December that the “insurrectionist ban” applies to Trump.

To reach that conclusion, the Colorado justices also ruled against Trump on several other key matters. They concluded that the ban applies to the presidency, even though the presidency isn’t explicitly mentioned in the provision. They concluded that courts have the power to enforce the ban, and don’t need to wait for authorization from Congress.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh tossed an important question to Trump’s attorney about a 19th century decision dealing with the same issue the court is wrestling with now.

Known as “Griffin’s case,” the 1869 decision found that the insurrection ban could not be enforced without some action first from Congress. The opinion was written by Chief Justice Salmon Chase. It was not a Supreme Court decision but it’s one of the closest things the Supreme Court has to a precedent.

By asking the question, Kavanaugh – often a key swing vote — seems to be signaling an interest in siding with Trump in a narrow way: By ruling that the insurrection ban at issue cannot be enforced with a law enacted by Congress.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

From where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.

While Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.

You cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote to watch in the case, suggested one of the main arguments raised by challengers was “at war” with the history of the insurrection ban at center in the case.

“The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Roberts said. “On the other hand, it augmented federal power.”

Roberts suggested the idea that the amendment would give states power to remove candidates under the provision would be “at war” with the whole thrust and history of the 14th Amendment.

The challengers claimed the 14th Amendment lets states bar insurrectionists from the ballot – which means in simple terms that Congress was providing some very strong powers to the states.

Former President Donald Trump's lawyer Jonathan Mitchell argued that the events of January 6 were “shameful, criminal, violent” – but not an insurrection.

The definition of insurrection is crucial to the case because if January 6 doesn’t reach that high bar, then Trump couldn’t have “engaged in insurrection,” which would disqualify him from office under the 14th Amendment.

“This was a riot, it was not an insurrection,” Mitchell said. “For an insurrection, there needs to be an organized concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence.”

Mitchell made these comments while being questioned by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was the only justice to ask him sharp questions about the definition of “insurrection” that touched on Trump’s conduct on that day.

Notably, Mitchell’s comments condemning January 6 are different than what his client, Trump, regularly says in interviews and on the campaign trail, and even on that day. He has repeatedly praised his supporters and bemoaned the fact that hundreds of them are now being subjected to criminal prosecution for their actions.",2024-02-09,15

Arizona's Maricopa County expects to start releasing Friday evening the first results from its outstanding 290,000 mail-in ballots that voters dropped off on Election Day, a top official told CNN late Thursday.

""We should start to see those tomorrow, I believe – we’ll start seeing those come in,"" said Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors.

Maricopa is Arizona's most populous county and it includes the city of Phoenix.

We’re going to do it on a timeline that’s frankly consistent with how long it takes us to get this done every two and every four years.”

Gates pushed back on criticism from Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who has been questioning the integrity of the elections and the length of time to get results.

“There’s nothing out of the ordinary; it makes me wonder if Kari Lake has really been following elections in the past in Maricopa County,” he said.

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”",2024-02-24,6

South Carolina primary voters flocked to Jennie Moore Elementary School in Mount Pleasant on Saturday, with several participants waiting for close to an hour to cast their votes.

The town is part of Charleston County, one of the counties in South Carolina that supported the Democratic candidate in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

That dynamic was reflected in interviews CNN conducted with a series of voters on Saturday, some of whom were Democrats who said they were proud to take advantage of the state's primary registration rules, which allow members of any party to participate.

Missel said she believes Haley is hoping Democrats will ""save her from Trump.""

""I don’t think enough will, because I don’t like her either, but I just want him to lose,” she told CNN.

More from voters: Roy Layman, a 78-year-old registered Republican who voted for Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, told CNN he voted for Haley because he was impressed with her performance as the state's former governor. He added that he believed Trump has been “a mess” over the past two years, and that he wasn't sure if he would support him over President Joe Biden in a general election.

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

Feinstein rarely talked about the day when Moscone and Milk were shot but she opened up about the tragic events in a 2017 interview with CNN’s Dana Bash.

Feinstein was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors then, and assassin Dan White had been a friend and colleague of hers.

“The door to the office opened, and he came in, and I said, ‘Dan?’ ”

“I heard the doors slam, I heard the shots, I smelled the cordite,” Feinstein recalled.

It was Feinstein who announced the double assassination to the public. She was later sworn in as the first female mayor of San Francisco.

Her political career was marked by a series of historic firsts.

By that time she became mayor in 1978, she had already broken one glass ceiling, becoming the first female chair of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

California’s first woman sent to the US Senate racked up many other firsts in Washington. Among those: She was the first woman to sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the first female chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, and the first female chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Feinstein also served on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and held the title of ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2017 to 2021. In November 2022, she was poised to become president pro tempore of the Senate – third in line to the presidency – but declined to pursue the position, citing her husband’s recent death.

Feinstein reflected on her experience as a woman in politics in her 2017 interview with Bash, saying, “Look, being a woman in our society even today is difficult,” and noting, “I know it in the political area.” She would later note in a statement the week she became the longest-serving woman in US history, “We went from two women senators when I ran for office in 1992 to 24 today – and I know that number will keep climbing.”

“It has been a great pleasure to watch more and more women walk the halls of the Senate,” Feinstein said in November 2022.",2023-09-29,1

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.

65e4447d396409552c7bfa53,Supreme Court justices: All but 8 have been White men,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/scotus-card-imageartboard-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",https://edition.cnn.com/politics/supreme-court-justices-dg/index.html,2024-02-04,Supreme Court justices: All but 8 have been White men  CNN,"CNN —

Since the Supreme Court first convened in 1790, 116 justices have served on the bench. Of those, 108 have been White men.

But in recent decades the court has become more diverse. Over half of its appointed justices since 1990 have been women or minorities.

The two most recently appointed justices were women, and one a woman of color. Ketanji Brown Jackson, previously a federal appeals court judge, in 2022 became the first Black woman on the high court. She succeeded Stephen Breyer, who is White.

And Amy Coney Barrett, also previously a federal appeals court judge, was chosen by Donald Trump to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020.

Here’s how the demographics of the nation’s highest court have stacked up since its beginning.

Four have been people of color

Only three African American justices, Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson have served on the court.

The first appointment – when Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Marshall – was in 1967. When Johnson announced the nomination, he said he thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it.

Thomas’s appointment happened decades later, in 1991 under George H.W. Bush.

Jackson became the court’s third Black justice in 2022 after being nominated by Joe Biden.

Sonia Sotomayor is the first and only Hispanic justice in history. (Some say Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was Portuguese, was the first Hispanic member, but he doesn’t qualify under current Census standards.) She was nominated by Barack Obama in 2009.

No justices so far have identified as Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander.

And no women or people of color have served as chief justices of the nation’s highest court.

Six have been women

Of the 116 justices in history, 110 – or 94.8% – have been men. Until 1981, every Supreme Court justice was male. But Ronald Reagan promised he’d put a woman on the court, and during his first year in office he kept that promise by appointing Sandra Day O’Connor.

Before that, presidents had appointed women to lower courts. While Harry Truman, who was president from 1945-1953, thought about nominating a woman to the high court, sitting justices at the time said women “would inhibit their conference deliberations.”

Bill Clinton made the second appointment of a woman to the high court by nominating Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993.

And Barack Obama appointed two women, the aforementioned Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, whom he appointed in 2010.

Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett and Jackson all sit on the current court.

Eight have been Jewish

At its founding, the court was made up almost entirely of Protestant members, and a majority of the 116 justices throughout history have been Protestants.

The court today is more diverse. There are currently six Catholic justices, not including Neil Gorsuch — nominated by Trump in 2017 — who was raised Catholic but has more recently worshiped at an Episcopal church.

The US has never had a Jewish president, but eight Jewish justices have sat on the bench, including Kagan who currently sits on the bench.

There has never been a Muslim or Hindu justice on the Supreme Court.

Ivy League graduates dominate in recent decades

While the educational law background of many Supreme Court justices’ has varied in past centuries, modern history has been less so. Of the 60 justices confirmed between 1902 and 2022, 15 graduated from Harvard, seven from Yale and four from Columbia law schools.

On today’s court, all but one — Barrett, who attended Notre Dame Law School — hail from Yale or Harvard. The four Yale graduates are Brett Kavanaugh, Sotomayor, Thomas and Samuel Alito, and the four Harvard graduates are Gorsuch, Kagan, Jackson and Chief Justice John Roberts.

Since Oliver Wendell Holmes’ appointment in 1902, the Supreme Court has maintained at least one Harvard law graduate, and it has usually had multiple graduates.

Yale Law School did not have a graduate on the court until Potter Stewart’s confirmation in 1958.

Why diversity matters

The Supreme Court has ruled on a diverse set of topics and sees a wide array of cases.

It’s laid out decisions that affect many segments of the nation’s population, like whether schools should be segregated, whether women can get abortions and if public accommodations can refuse services based on religious beliefs.

The court has heard cases that none of its members can directly relate to. Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was decided by nine justices, none of whom have identified as gay. No past or present justices have publicly identified themselves as anything other than straight.

In 2016, Sotomayor said the court could use more diversity.

“A different perspective can permit you to more fully understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand,” she said.

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that former President Donald Trump could not be removed from the ballot in Colorado or any other state. It was a sweeping and historic ruling that brushed aside a lawsuit claiming that he disqualified himself from office because of his actions on January 6, 2021.

In a repudiation of the notion that Trump’s actions left him ineligible under the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban,” a unanimous court ruled that an individual state could not dump the former president from the ballot.

However, the justices did not say if Trump was an insurrectionist and split on technicalities of how the ban could be enforced. A 5-4 majority said no state could dump a federal candidate off any ballot — but four justices asserted that the court should have limited its opinion.

Here are some of the key takeaways from the ruling:

Trump will appear on the ballot: There was no equivocation in the Supreme Court’s short opinion: States do not have the power to remove a federal candidate from the ballot under the Constitution’s “insurrectionist ban.” It is Congress, the court wrote, that can enforce the provision, not states. That means that the impact of the decision will sweep far wider than the controversy in Colorado.

That means that the impact of the decision will sweep far wider than the controversy in Colorado. Court heads off 2025 showdown: The high court’s opinion also appeared to make it much harder for the insurrectionist ban to be enforced at the federal level. Four justices – Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – asserted that their colleagues went too far. The court’s opinion, the three liberal justices wrote in a concurrence, “shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement,” by requiring Congress to act to pass legislation first, something that’s highly unlikely. The move appeared to address a concern that a narrow ruling from the court could lead to a messy confrontation in Congress when the electoral votes are counted in 2025.

Avoiding insurrectionist debate: The Supreme Court’s opinion doesn’t directly address whether Trump’s actions on January 6 qualified as an “insurrection,"" skirting an issue that the courts in Colorado wrestled with. The unsigned opinion noted that lower courts in Colorado found Trump’s remarks before the attack on the US Capitol qualified as engaging in an insurrection within the meaning of the Constitution. But the court’s unsigned opinion didn’t return to that judgment direction.

Barrett's concern with ""national temperature"": Barrett devoted more than half of her one-page concurrence to urging the public to look past the fact that four of the court’s members — herself included — disagreed with how broadly their colleagues decided the case. The conservative justice stressed that although she and the three liberal justices were at odds with their other colleagues, “this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency.”

They said that the majority opinion limited federal enforcement of the insurrection ban as well as state enforcement. That decision, they said, wasn’t before the Supreme Court in the case and would “insulate all alleged insurrectionists” from future challenges.

Jose Luis Magana/AP

The House speakership drama enters a new week under increased urgency as Israel declared war Sunday following unprecedented surprise attacks by Hamas.

Kevin McCarthy’s historic ouster as speaker leaves the House in uncharted legal territory regarding what it can do under acting Speaker Patrick McHenry. When lawmakers return to Washington, they will be under pressure to elect a new speaker swiftly amid the crisis in Israel, which has prompted some calls from within the Republican Party to speed up their timeline given the national security implications of keeping the role vacant.

In a briefing with House leadership Sunday night, Biden administration briefers from the State and Defense Departments told lawmakers they are moving as quickly as they can to deliver weapons and resources to Israel that were part of already existing contracts by accelerating them, three people familiar with the call told CNN. That could help ensure that the US can provide some items as soon as possible even as there are larger questions about how quickly Congress could act on a larger aid package.

Administration officials said they will look to the current $100 million in Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the rapid dispatch of weapons from existing stocks, to send more aid immediately, according to a person familiar with the discussion. The drawdown will likely need additional funds from Congress, the officials told lawmakers.

As the Biden administration looks to provide additional assistance to Israel, officials were unsure Saturday about what could be accomplished without a sitting speaker. While McHenry is serving as speaker pro tempore, he has little power outside of recessing, adjourning or recognizing speaker nominations, and it’s unclear whether he can participate in intelligence briefings on the crisis in Israel.

Multiple lawmakers on national security and appropriations committees have asked for classified briefings, with indications that may happen soon after the Monday national holiday.

Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Sunday that he had conversations with the White House and the National Security Council on Saturday, but he has not yet met with the so-called Gang of Eight – which typically includes the top leaders and heads of the intelligence committees in both parties and both chambers.

“I do anticipate that we’ll have the opportunity to have a secure briefing at some point next week,” Jeffries told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

Jeffries said it is his understanding that the Biden administration can make some decisions regarding aid to Israel without waiting for Congress and urged the administration to do so, adding that he expects “it will provide whatever assistance it can.”

Since the beginning of February, more money has been spent on ads for the California Senate race than the presidential race.

At $71.3 million, California’s Senate race has seen more ad spending than any non-presidential 2024 contest so far, excluding future reservations.

The next closest is the Ohio Senate race which has drawn about $29.2 million in ad spending so far.

For comparison, the last two Senate primaries in California – albeit with incumbents – drew far less in ad spending; about $4.2 million in 2018, when the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein was seeking reelection; and just over $6 million in 2022, when Sen. Alex Padilla was seeking his first full term, having been appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021 to replace Vice President Kamala Harris.

The key question entering the race to fill the seat once held by the late Sen. Feinstein is whether the general election will feature two Democrats or one.

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff appears poised to claim one of the spots on the November ballot and would prefer to take on Republican Steve Garvey, a former baseball star, rather than fellow Democratic Rep. Katie Porter.

Alaska Democrats will hold a party-run mail primary ending on April 6. The party expects to report results no later than the evening of April 7.

November will be Alaska’s first presidential election held under ranked-choice voting, where voters can rank up to four candidates in order of preference.

Elections for other offices in Alaska also use a top-four open primary system, where candidates from all parties appear on the same primary ballot and voters select one. The top four then advance to a ranked-choice general election.

Ranked-choice voting delivered Alaska’s first woman and native Alaskan to the House in a 2022 special election when Democrat Mary Peltola was elected to finish the late GOP Rep. Don Young’s term. She won a full term in November 2022.

The first down-ballot primaries of the year on Super Tuesday are likely to be even more consequential than the day’s presidential contests, which are unlikely to change the trajectory of the Democratic and Republican races.

On the ballot Tuesday are primaries for US Senate and governor, but it’s the primaries for the US House – where Republicans are defending a razor-thin majority – that are by far the most important for the balance of power in Washington.

Central to the fight for control of the chamber is California. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to flip the House, and in California alone, the party is targeting seven GOP-held seats. President Joe Biden would have won five of them in 2020 had the current district lines been in place, making these so-called crossover districts potential low-hanging fruit for a party looking to flip seats.

Other states holding primaries for competitive House races Tuesday include North Carolina and Texas — and, to a lesser extent, Alabama, where redistricting has created a new district that’s much more favorable to Democrats. The four states, and Arkansas, also have primaries for seats seen as safe for either party, but the nominating contests could serve as key ideological tests.

Only Texas and California have Senate primaries Tuesday. Republicans need to pick up one or two seats in the fall – depending on who wins the White House – to win the majority. The Texas race for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz’s seat has taken on increased importance for Senate Democrats in what is otherwise a tough landscape for them.

North Carolina is also hosting gubernatorial primaries Tuesday in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The open-seat contest is expected to draw fierce attention in this presidential battleground state, which former President Donald Trump narrowly carried in 2020 and which Biden is hoping to flip.

Since the beginning of February, more money has been spent on ads for the California Senate race than the presidential race.

At $71.3 million, California’s Senate race has seen more ad spending than any non-presidential 2024 contest so far, excluding future reservations.

The next closest is the Ohio Senate race which has drawn about $29.2 million in ad spending so far.

For comparison, the last two Senate primaries in California – albeit with incumbents – drew far less in ad spending; about $4.2 million in 2018, when the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein was seeking reelection; and just over $6 million in 2022, when Sen. Alex Padilla was seeking his first full term, having been appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021 to replace Vice President Kamala Harris.

The key question entering the race to fill the seat once held by the late Sen. Feinstein is whether the general election will feature two Democrats or one.

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff appears poised to claim one of the spots on the November ballot and would prefer to take on Republican Steve Garvey, a former baseball star, rather than fellow Democratic Rep. Katie Porter.

Schiff's campaign has run ads elevating Garvey as ""too conservative"" in hopes of getting a more favorable matchup in the deep-blue state.",2024-03-05,15

“Losers who are losers are never graceful,” he said in a rare interview with New Yorker’s Evan Osnos when pressed on whether Trump would concede. “I just think that he’ll do anything to try to win. If—and when—I win, I think he’ll contest it. No matter what the result is.”

The president has repeatedly cast Trump as a “loser” on the campaign trail and at closed-door fundraisers. And in a campaign speech in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, earlier this year, he framed Trump as the “election denier-in-chief.”

Biden’s view is also held by many Americans: In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS out last month, just 25% of Americans say they expect Trump to accept the results if he loses in November as the Republican nominee, down from 37% in October 2020. By contrast, 76% of Americans expect that Biden would concede if he loses, similar to the 71% who said the same four years ago.

Here’s a look at how CNN reports on the results of elections and how the CNN Decision Desk projects the winner.

Q. Where does CNN get its election data and information?

A. CNN is a member of the National Election Pool along with ABC News, CBS News and NBC News, working with Edison Research to collect vote returns from election officials and to conduct exit or entrance polls among voters who are casting ballots in major elections. Edison Research deploys a team of hundreds of interviewers and vote reporters across each state in those contests to conduct scientific surveys on voters’ opinions and to work with election officials to report election results quickly and accurately.

CNN correspondents and anchors are also often on the scene of major contests, reporting on what they learn about the situation on the ground from election officials and voters themselves, and can provide pieces of information about the vote count that are essential to accurate projections.

Q. How does CNN project races where one candidate holds a wide lead?

A. In some cases, CNN’s Decision Desk can project a result based on exit or entrance poll results when one candidate holds a very wide lead. Exit and entrance polls are effective for this purpose for several reasons.

First, a statistically sound sample can produce an accurate estimate of the outcome of the election within the poll’s margin of sampling error. In races with a wide margin, the difference between the two candidates vastly exceeds the error margin, giving the team confidence that the poll’s result will hold up when all the votes are counted.

Second, unlike pre-election polls, exit and entrance polls interview voters and caucusgoers at their polling places, eliminating the need for what pollsters call likely voter modeling, used to try to determine who will vote. Those conducting the poll can be sure that the people in these samples actually voted because they have physically shown up at the location where voting happens.

And finally, in states with large absentee or early voting populations, the National Election Pool will supplement results from in-person exit or entrance polls on Election Day with surveys of absentee and early voters conducted online, by phone or in-person to make sure that the views of all voters are reflected in those surveys.

Q. What about races with tighter margins?

A. Elections that cannot be projected based on exit poll results could ultimately be projected based on several different ways of analyzing actual vote data.

As vote returns start to come in, the CNN Decision Desk will be looking for patterns in the data, how the results and turnout compare with past results for each location, and whether there are any anomalies in what’s been reported so far.

As counties and localities begin reporting results, the team’s statistical models will start to run, modeling outcomes based on different combinations of past vote, type of vote and geographic region. Consistent, strong models using those data and producing a high level of statistical confidence (99% certainty or more) could lead to a projection of the winner.

At the same time, Edison Research will attempt to collect the actual vote at each of the places where an exit poll was conducted, and since that sample of voting locations is a scientifically representative sample of all locations in a state, it is possible that those vote results could be enough to make for a statistically sound projection, even if there isn’t much county-level vote reported.

And in the closest races, the CNN Decision Desk will be looking closely at estimates of how much vote is left to count – overall amount, what type it is and where it could come from. Determining whether there is enough remaining vote to shift the outcome will be the central question in deciding when it is possible to project a winner.",2024-01-24,2

Usually incumbent presidents win party primaries in a walk. But due to the Democratic Party's beef with the date of New Hampshire's primary, President Joe Biden isn't even appearing on the ballot in New Hampshire. The Democratic Party is also penalizing New Hampshire by taking away most of its delegates to the national convention.

Even though he's boycotting the ballot, Biden's supporters are still hoping he wins and have organized a campaign to encourage Democratic primary voters to write his name in on the ballot.

You won't usually hear about write-in campaigns because they're usually just about impossible to win. It's the “triple lindy” of American politics.

The most recent, major write-in victory in a nationally important race happened in 2010, when Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, lost her party primary to Joe Miller, who mounted a challenge from the right wing. It was only the second successful Senate write-in campaign.

The late Sen. Strom Thurmond, a seriously controversial figure today, won the first general election write-in campaign back in 1954, riding a wave of frustration after the party anointed a candidate to fill the shoes of the primary winner who had died.

So is a write-in win impossible? No. Is it a frequent occurrence? It is not.

Biden should have an easier time as a write-in candidate than either Murkowski or Thurmond. None of his competition has anywhere close to his name recognition. Plus, the people who show up for a Democratic primary in a year when their party is the incumbent are perhaps more politically attuned than the public at large.",2024-01-24,2

After 2 hours and 20 minutes of oral arguments, the three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals appears inclined to restore the limited gag order in former President Donald Trump’s federal election subversion case, but may loosen some restrictions so he can more directly criticize special counsel Jack Smith.

None of the judges embraced Trump’s claims that the gag order should be wiped away for good because it is a “categorically unprecedented” violation of his free speech rights.

Yet they also posed sharp questions to prosecutors as they tried to find the boundary of where intense campaign-trail rhetoric crosses the line of undermining a criminal case.

The limited gag order from district Judge Tanya Chutkan – which was temporarily frozen by the appeals panel when they agreed to hear the case — restricts Trump’s ability to directly attack Smith, members of his team, court staff or potential trial witnesses. He is allowed to criticize the Justice Department, proclaim his innocence, can say that the case is “politically motivated.”

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP/File)

The 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.

Rep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.

Republicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.

Here are key things to know about Tuesday’s vote:

How the day will unfold: Congress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, Jan. 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.

Members will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.

Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.

Members can vote for anyone they want: There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.

Both parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead. McCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.

If neither wins a majority, a “floor fight” happens: Lawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected. This is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker. In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.

It doesn’t always require 218 votes: One important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.

William T. Robles via AP

A former FBI informant charged with falsely telling his handler that the Bidens accepted multimillion-dollar bribes will remain in jail while he awaits trial, a federal judge ruled Monday.

US District Judge Otis Wright said that “there is nothing garden variety” about the criminal case involving former informant Alexander Smirnov, whom Wright said has a “habit or practice of making false statements.”

“I have not changed my mind,” Wright said. “The defendant will be remanded pending trial.”

Smirnov, a 43-year-old dual US-Israeli citizen, is accused of telling his handler that a Ukrainian energy company paid $5 million in bribes each to President Joe Biden and his son Hunter – an allegation that prosecutors say was a complete fabrication.

“The records are fairly clear,” prosecutor Leo Wise said. Smirnov “made it all up.”

Smirnov has pleaded not guilty to the two charges he faces for allegedly lying to his handler and falsifying records. A magistrate judge in Las Vegas, where Smirnov lives, had ordered that Smirnov could leave jail and be subject to GPS monitoring. Smirnov was re-arrested days later, however, while meeting with his attorneys.

Former President Donald Trump has been laying the groundwork for a 2024 general election battle over the working-class voters who helped propel him to the White House in 2016, but favored President Joe Biden in 2020.

Trump’s campaign believes it can drive a wedge between Biden and organized labor. It has made appealing to union members a key part of its strategy to win over working-class voters, especially in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — all three of whom broke for Biden in the 2020 election after backing Trump four years earlier.

While in Michigan, Trump has argued that the influx of migrants would negatively effect union workers. During his September visit to a nonunion shop amid the autoworker strike he lamented that Biden’s policies encouraging a move to electric vehicles was threatening their jobs.

The United Auto Workers endorsed Biden in January — Trump responded by calling the organization’s president Shawn Fain a “weapon of mass destruction.”

Trump later met with Teamsters union leaders and members in Washington, DC, which angered one executive board member, who denounced Trump as “a known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.” Biden is expected to meet with the Teamsters next month.

Trump’s share of the vote of union households fell from 48% in 2016 to 37% in 2020, according to CNN exit polls. The recent Fox News survey from Michigan found Biden leading Trump 53% to 41% among union households. Regaining that support could prove key to turning Michigan red again in 2024.",2024-02-28,26

The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Gary Peters heads to the floor of the Senate for a vote on Capitol Hill on February 11, in Washington, DC. Samuel Corum/Getty Images

Sen. Gary Peters, the chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm who hails from Michigan, downplayed the progressive-led effort to vote “uncommitted” in Tuesday’s primary as a form of protest over President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

“I'm not sure what we'll see tonight, we'll be watching that number. But it's certainly not unusual for people to vote uncommitted,” Peters told CNN, ticking off the number of uncommitted votes in previous cycles, including when Barack Obama was president and ran unopposed.

Asked if he harbors any concerns about cracks in Biden’s coalition, Peters said: “No, no, I don't see that. But we'll continue to hold that together and continue to be strong. You know, if you look at former President Trump — he has an opponent taking 40% in primaries away from him. To me that's more significant.”

However, others in the party have expressed concern about the organized “uncommitted” effort — led in part by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — even as they say they respect the views of voters and acknowledge it’s imperative for Biden to hear out their concerns in a key battleground state.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the other Michigan senator, said on CNN earlier today she thinks the campaign to urge voters to vote uncommitted is “certainly not helpful.”

And one House Democrat told CNN there is “massive” frustration inside the party over the effort, worried it could backfire if it winds up helping get Trump elected. “The president is weak enough without hobbling him more with a concerted campaign against him,” the lawmaker told CNN.",2024-02-28,26

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of House progressives, said the number of ""uncommitted"" votes in Michigan is a major warning sign for President Joe Biden in November.

“This is exactly what I warned about several months ago,” Jayapal told CNN. “The war on Gaza is a deep moral issue and the lack of attention and empathy for this perspective from the administration is breaking apart the fragile coalition we built to elect Joe Biden in 2020.”

Jayapal says there is “still a little bit of time to change this dynamic.” But she added: “It has to be a dramatic policy and rhetorical shift from the president on this issue and a new strategy to rebuild a real partnership with progressives in multiple communities who are absolutely key to winning the election.”

Organizers of the movement to vote ""uncommitted"" had hoped at least 10,000 people would cast their vote for the cause, a nod to the 10,700-vote margin that delivered the state to Donald Trump in 2016. They had far surpassed that goal just before 11 p.m. Tuesday night.

One of the leading voices in the campaign to vote “uncommitted,” former Democratic US Rep. Andy Levin, said the early numbers show a “historic” result. He said he felt the effort was a success in conveying people's anger to the president.

Levin’s message to voters who are mad about the war in Gaza was: “Don't stay home, don't stay home. Go out and shake your fist. Go to the ballot box and tell the president you're mad otherwise, he won’t know.”

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.",2024-02-28,26

Few states are as closely associated with a single industry as Michigan and autos, which is holding its Republican and Democratic primaries today. But auto jobs aren’t as dominant in the state as they once were. Michigan has lost many of the automotive jobs it once had to other parts of the country.

Jobs in the state’s auto plants, parts factories and corporate offices shrank by 35% since 1990, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And those jobs make up only 3.7% of the jobs in the state, roughly half what it was in 1990. Today, more than four times as many workers in Michigan have jobs at one of the state’s hospitals than at an auto assembly plant.

Some of the auto jobs disappeared because of automation. Some evaporated as auto plants moved to Mexico since the passage of NAFTA and as some auto manufacturing shifted to nonunion plants in Southern states.

With cars far more technologically complex today, many tech jobs in the state focus on serving the auto industry, along with traditional support industries like trucking and other suppliers that don’t show up as auto parts makers.

Two of the Big Three companies, GM and Chrysler, went bankrupt in 2009 and needed federal bailouts to survive.

That took a bite not only out of employment, but out of auto wages, as the United Auto Workers union agreed to deep concessions, including a lower tier of wages, to help keep all three companies alive. But that helped drag down wages in the state overall.

The state’s median household income was higher than the national average until 2000, according to the Growing Michigan Together Council, a group formed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to develop solutions to Michigan’s challenges. The state’s median income declined relative to the US level over the past five decades.

Today, the median household income in the state was just under $67,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau.

However, following a six-week strike last fall at GM, Ford and Stellantis, the United Auto Workers union won immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members. Pay for members is expected to rise more than 30% during the life of the contract, which expires in 2028.

While jobs in the state’s auto and parts plants have stabilized in recent years, jobs in the manufacturing sector overall have edged up by 4.5% since the end of 2020. But that still hasn’t recaptured jobs lost in that sector during the first year of the pandemic. Overall employment in the state in December was up 9.6% from the end of 2020, but still off 0.5% from December of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Asked about Michigan, Democratic Sen. Dick Blumenthal told CNN: “I’m deeply concerned about this election and about holding together our coalition because there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed to make sure that we're unified and we can take nothing for granted. This will be a hard fought election, and we need every single vote.”

Reacting to the Michigan results, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin said Biden needs to be more direct in addressing concerns over the war in Gaza.

But Sen. Gary Peters, the Michigan Democrat, tried to ease concern, saying his state has a history of protest votes.

“Oh, I’m not concerned. It’s not unusual to have uncommitted. We’ve had that in all elections,” Peters said. “We continue to do our work to make sure that folks understand that voting for President Biden is absolutely critical for the future of this country.”

Senate Democrats largely seemed to agree Wednesday morning they were not worried about Biden’s performance in Michigan and argued that when the choice is between Biden and former President Donald Trump, voters will come back to Biden in the general election.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said “I think voters will come home in November. I think you had a lot of people who wanted to express their concern.” But Van Hollen did admit that the numbers last night suggested the administration may need to have shifted its message on Gaza sooner and may need to do more to ensure humanitarian aid gets to the region.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, says he had no concerns about the number of uncommitted voters last night, saying Biden’s numbers were “fantastic.”",2024-02-28,26

President Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win tonight’s Democratic primary in Michigan. But that hasn’t stopped those who believe he should be pushing harder for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas from organizing a vote for “uncommitted.”

That is, a vote in the primary for “uncommitted” is a protest vote against Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza. It’s not clear how well this effort will do, but a high percentage of support could suggest general election trouble for Biden in the Wolverine State.

Take a look at the 2020 Republican presidential primaries: President Donald Trump romped to wins everywhere with 94% of the vote nationally, but his weakest region (or census subdivision) by far was New England. He was under 90% of the primary vote in all those states and even came in with less than 80% in Connecticut. In the general election, all the New England states swung against Trump by about 2 to 4 times as much as the swing against him nationally compared with 2016.

In the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, we saw a somewhat similar phenomenon. President Barack Obama won about 90% of the vote nationally. He got below 60% of the primary vote in a line of states from Oklahoma to Arkansas to Kentucky to West Virginia.

All four were among the six states that swung the most toward the Republican candidate on the presidential level from 2004 to 2012.

It’s not exactly clear what a low level of support tonight for Biden would be. Still, he got over 95% of the vote in South Carolina and nearly 90% in Nevada. If he falls significantly short of those levels, it could be ominous.",2024-02-28,26

(WCVB-TV/ABC/Reuters)

Jack Teixeira, 21, a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, was arrested by the FBI on Thursday in connection with the leaking of classified documents that have been posted online.

John Miller, CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, discussed the circumstances surrounding the investigation and the dramatic arrest outside a residence in Massachusetts.

How did the arrest on Thursday happen?

John Miller: What you saw was a very intensive investigation that has been going on since the day the Department of Defense referred this case to the Justice Department and the FBI.

When the FBI made the call to move in today, it was not their preferred plan.

They have been closing in on Teixeira for a few days. The investigation is only five days old. His father’s home and his mom’s residence were both under surveillance today while agents worked with prosecutors to ensure the evidence they had was enough for prosecutors to approve they had probable cause to make an arrest. What they wanted to do was arrest him when he went to work at the military base where he was assigned. That would have been a controlled environment. But he didn’t go to work today.

Why didn't they want to arrest him at home?

Miller: His social media posts indicated he owned a significant number of weapons including military-style assault weapons and, of course, he has received military training in those weapons. It’s also pretty clear from stories appearing in The New York Times and The Washington Post that Jack Teixeira knew it was a matter of time before he was identified and arrested. Not knowing his mental state, going up against a trained military person in a house with weapons was not an ideal scenario. The surveillance teams were literally watching New York Times reporters showing up at the door of the house. The suspect’s name was in the Times and that was out on social media — so the FBI made the decision to move in.

What will the FBI be looking for in the house?

Miller: They are going to want any computers, phones, hard drives, thumb drives, discs, gaming systems, printers, basically anything that could store data. They are going to look for notes, writings, papers, and documents. They are going to look for other things — the hunting magazine or the nail clippers, those things that were seen on the bed where it appears the pictures of documents were taken. If the bedspread matches the one that was in the background of some of the pictures of documents, they’ll take that too.

So how was the suspect caught?

Miller: You had two fields of investigation here. One was on social media. How could you trace these documents back from Twitter to Discord to a private chatroom with a limited number of participants? That means serving Discord with orders to preserve these records so users can't delete them. That means getting subpoenas and search warrants for the contents of that chatroom. That takes some time because you have to show probable cause. The FBI was able to convince a reluctant witness who was a member of the chat group to cooperate and that helped move this process forward

The Washington Post was able to exploit that end of the case and talk to a member of the chat group who wouldn’t name the leader who posted the documents. The New York Times published his name before he was arrested, but that’s reporting, not evidence.

The DOD, FBI and OSI, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations explored those same paths, but they also did things reporters and online gamers and sleuths couldn’t do — they pulled logs. Who looked at those documents? Who, in a classified setting, read those reports and then sent them to a classified printer that logs every document it prints with a time stamp and the computer that sent the request. The computer records the chip of the ID card and the login of the user that pulled up the document to print it. They quickly narrowed a large number of possibilities to a very small number and zeroed in on this 21-year-old airman over the last 48 hours.

Jean Carroll defamation case  CNN,"Donald Trump clashed in court Wednesday with yet another judge overseeing one of his trials – after the judge in his civil defamation case threatened to remove the former president for making comments that could be overheard by the jury while his accuser was testifying.

The exchange with Judge Lewis Kaplan was merely the latest in a string of Trump’s in-court fights during two civil trials in New York over the past several months, offering a preview of what’s to come if any of the former president’s criminal trials are held this year as he runs for president.

Meanwhile, on the witness stand, E. Jean Carroll told the jury how Trump’s statements after she went public about him allegedly sexually assaulting her shattered her reputation and led to an onslaught of threatening messages. A civil jury last year found Carroll’s allegations to be credible.

“I thought I was going to get shot,” she said.

Carroll will return on the stand Thursday morning as Trump attorney Alina Habba finishes her cross-examination.

The former president is not expected to be there watching, as Trump plans to travel to Florida for his mother-in-law’s funeral, and Kaplan declined to postpone the trial in his absence at Trump’s request again on Wednesday.

President Joe Biden signed the bill late Saturday night.

Catch up here:

How it came together: House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced the stopgap proposal Saturday morning, a move that came after weeks of infighting among House Republicans and a failed effort to pass a GOP stopgap bill in the chamber. The bill passed the House with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, and it then was sent to the Senate. The final vote was 88 to 9.

The bill will keep the government open through November 17 and includes natural disaster aid but not additional funding for Ukraine or border security.

Concerns over Ukraine funding: The stopgap bill originally included funding for Ukraine to help Kyiv fight the full-scale invasion from Russia, but the funds were dropped after some conservatives raised objections during negotiations.

Democratic Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet briefly held up the vote on the bill after he objected over concerns about the lack of funding in it. Bipartisan members of Senate leadership released a joint statement committing to vote on further funding for Ukraine aid ""in the coming weeks.""

House Democratic leadership said in a statement that they expect McCarthy to bring a separate Ukraine aid bill to vote when the House returns.

“We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,” Biden said in a statement.

McCarthy's fate unknown: The decision by McCarthy to put a bill on the floor that would win support from Democrats could put his speakership at risk as hardline conservatives continue to threaten a vote to oust him from the top House leadership post.

McCarthy was defiant after the vote, daring his detractors to try to push him out as he argued he did what was needed to govern effectively.

“If somebody wants to make a motion against me, bring it,” McCarthy told CNN’s Manu Raju at a news conference. “There has to be an adult in the room. I am going to govern with what’s best for this country.”

Hardliners are expected to force a vote to remove McCarthy as speaker, just “not yet,” according to a Republican lawmaker.

Fire alarm incident: New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman pulled a fire alarm in a House office building on Saturday morning shortly before the House was scheduled to vote on the funding bill, which he said was an accident.

“I was trying to get to a door. I thought the alarm would open the door, and I pulled the fire alarm to open the door by accident,” he told reporters.

“I was just trying to get to my vote, and the door that’s usually open wasn’t open, it was closed,” Bowman added.

House Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil, who first revealed the incident, said ""an investigation into why it was pulled is underway.""

McCarthy said the House ethics committee should look into it, while GOP Rep. Lisa McClain told CNN that she was circulating a resolution to censure Bowman.",2023-10-01,1
