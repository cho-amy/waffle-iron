Will she reply to Trump's racist attacks? In a post Tuesday on his Truth Social platform, Trump slammed Haley while referring to her first name, Nimarata — which he misspelled as Nimrada. Trump also recently amplified a post that falsely claimed Haley was ineligible to run for president because her parents were not United States citizens at the time of her birth. She was born in South Carolina, and is a US citizen.

       "    'text': 'An audio recording of a phone call between then-President Donald Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is played during Tuesday\\'s hearing. (Al Drago/Pool/AP)\\n\\nThe latest hearing before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection revealed new details Tuesday about how former President Donald Trump pressured state officials to help him overturn the 2020 presidential election.\\n\\nThe panel featured testimony from three Republican officials who were all on the receiving end of Trump\\'s outreach after the election: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, his deputy Gabe Sterling and Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers.\\n\\nLike previous hearings, these officials testified about their unwillingness to participate in legally dubious schemes that would undermine the election, including efforts to subvert the Electoral College with fake pro-Trump electors.\\n\\nThe panel\\'s next hearing is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET on Thursday and will focus on Trump\\'s attempt to use the Justice Department to back his election disinformation.\\n\\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Tuesday\\'s hearing:\\n\\nRepublican witnesses tie Trump directly to fake electors effort\\n\\nMultiple witnesses told the committee that Trump was personally involved in the effort to put forward slates of fake electors in key battleground states — a key part of the broader effort to overturn Biden\\'s legitimate election victory.\\n\\nCNN has previously reported on the role that key Trump allies, including his former attorney Rudy Giuliani, played in overseeing the effort but witnesses revealed new details Tuesday about how the former President himself was not only aware of the push, but seemingly endorsed it.\\n\\nBowers told the committee that he received a call from Trump and Giuliani during which they urged him to go along with a plan to put forward illegitimate, pro-Trump electors from the state.\\n\\n\"I told them I did not want to be used as a pawn,\" Bowers said on Tuesday, recalling what he told Giuliani and Trump on the Nov. 22, 2020 phone call.\\n\\nCommittee reveals new details about how congressional Republicans helped Trump\\'s efforts to overturn election\\n\\nTuesday\\'s hearing featured new details about two congressional Republicans played a role in Trump\\'s sprawling efforts to try to overturn his 2020 election loss. The first was Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who called Bowers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, asking him to support decertification of his state\\'s electors for Biden.\\n\\n\"I said I would not,\" Bowers testified on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe second occurred several hours later, minutes before then-Vice President Mike Pence gaveled in the joint session of Congress to certify the electoral votes. According to text messages obtained by the committee, an aide to GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked an aide to Pence how Johnson could hand-deliver him the fake slates of Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin, which had not been sent to the National Archives. Pence\\'s aide responded that Johnson should \"not give that to him.\"\\n\\nBoth the effort to decertify Biden electors and put forward fake Trump electors were part of the Trump team\\'s scheme to stop the congressional certification of the election on Jan. 6. The role that Trump\\'s allies in Congress played have been of interest of interest to the committee, which has subpoenaed five House GOP members, including Biggs and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\\n\\nWitnesses describe how Trump\\'s lies had serious consequences — including threats\\n\\nThe committee\\'s hearing underscored how the lies about the election spread by Trump and his team spiraled into multi-faceted disasters for the state officials forced to grapple with them.\\n\\nAll of the witnesses who appeared at Tuesday\\'s hearing talked about the serious repercussions they faced as a result of the false claims that Trump and his team put forward. That included pressure to help in the effort to overturn the election, the repeated attempts to try to debunk the claims and the threats they faced from pro-Trump supporters for refusing to go along with Trump\\'s efforts.\\n\\nBowers delivered emotional testimony about \"disturbing\" protests outside his home. He got emotional as he discussed the impact protests at this house had on his wife and his daughter, who was at home gravely ill at the time and was \"upset by what was happening outside.\" He also read passages from his personal journal about friends who had turned on him.\\n\\nRaffensperger described the attacks that his wife faced after the election, which he said he suspected was an attempt to pressure him to quit. Schiff cited Raffensperger\\'s book, in which he wrote, \"I felt then and still believe today that this was a threat.\"\\n\\nRepublican officials take the lead testifying against Trump\\n\\nYet again, the Democratic-run January 6 committee turned to Republican officials to make their case against Trump. In fact, the majority of the in-person witnesses so far have been Republicans.\\n\\nTuesday\\'s hearing featured in-person testimony from three conservative Republicans who endorsed Trump in 2020. The committee also played deposition clips from two other GOP officials: Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler.\\n\\nThey all provided damning testimony against Trump, describing how he repeatedly tried to twist their arms and cajole them to overturn the results. They also described the threats and pressure they faced from Trump supporters who believed his election lies and protested outside their homes and offices and bombarded them with calls and text messages.\\n\\nTop Arizona Republican refutes Trump in real-time\\n\\nBowers said under oath Tuesday that Trump lied about him in a press release that came out shortly before the hearing started, where Trump claimed Bowers told him in November 2020 that he believed the election was rigged.\\n\\nIn the statement, Trump attacked Bowers and described a call they had after the election, claiming, \"during the conversation, he told me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona.\" Trump added, \"Bowers should hope there\\'s not a tape of the conversation.\"\\n\\nUnder questioning from Schiff, Bowers confirmed that he \"did have a conversation with the president, but that certainly isn\\'t it.\"\\n\\nEmotional testimony highlights victims of Trump\\'s disinformation\\n\\nLater in the day, the committee heard from Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, who were election workers in Atlanta during the 2020 election. Trump, Giuliani and other GOP figures put them both at the center of their unhinged lies about massive voter fraud in Georgia.\\n\\nCoverage of Trump\\'s presidency often focused on his words and lies. But the emotional and deeply personal testimony from Moss and Freeman flipped the script and showed the human toll of Trump\\'s lies.\\n\\nThey described in devastating terms how Trump\\'s lies essentially destroyed their lives.\\n\\nMoss said she felt \"helpless\" and stopped giving out her business card because \"I don\\'t want anyone knowing my name.\" Her mother said she gets \"nervous when I have to give food orders\" because someone who believes Trump\\'s lies might recognize her name. She said she felt \"homeless\" while she lived in hiding for two months after the FBI told her she wasn\\'t safe at home.\\n\\n\"I have lost my sense of security, all because of a group of people, starting with (Trump) and his ally Rudy Giuliani, decided to scapegoat me, and my daughter, Shaye, to push lies about how the election was stolen,\" Freeman said in a videotaped deposition, a clip of which was played during Tuesday\\'s hearing.',\n",

       "    'text': 'President Trump’s team launched a series of lawsuits in key battleground states that seemed less about sound legal reasoning and more about slowing Joe Biden from marching over the electoral vote threshold.\\n\\nAt times, the lawsuits have contested ballots in the double digits — hundreds if not thousands of votes away of potentially swing any state’s result.\\n\\n“Admitting defeat is not a plausible reaction so soon after the election, so they throw a lot of Hail Mary lawsuits at the wall and hope something sticks,” said longtime Republican elections lawyer and CNN contributor Ben Ginsberg. He said these types of suits aren’t indicative of a campaign that’s feeling optimistic — and instead, is scrambling.\\n\\n“I think much of the litigation is a longshot and unlikely to succeed,” said Franita Tolson, a law professor at USC Gould School of Law and CNN contributor.\\n\\nShe pointed to a lawsuit in Georgia the Trump campaign announced Wednesday night over a poll worker mixing unprocessed and processed absentee ballots. That might have the potential to affect few votes, she said.\\n\\n“I suspect that a big goal of this litigation is, in the short term, to change the narrative” from a potential Biden win to a conversation about election mismanagement or even fraud, Tolson said.\\n\\nAnother law professor and CNN contributor, Rick Hasen, said the lawsuits appeared to be more public relations than serious litigation. “These lawsuits so far are not tackling any major problem that would seem to call overall vote totals into questions,” he said.\\n\\nJustin Levitt, another elections expert and law professor, called some of the suits, like in Michigan, “laughable.”\\n\\n“One says you didn’t put people by absentee dropboxes, so stop the count. Huh?!”\\n\\nEven a Republican-appointed federal judge in Pennsylvania cast doubt on the validity of a suit from Republicans on Wednesday, when they challenged fewer than 100 ballots that absentee voters corrected in a county outside Philadelphia. At a hearing Wednesday morning, the judge, Timothy Savage, did not rule, yet he suggested the lawyer for Republican canvass observers was seeking to disenfranchise votes. He noted the lawsuit appeared to have other problems in its arguments.\\n\\nSome legal challenges in Pennsylvania from the Trump campaign were quickly dismissed on Election Day, with Trump touting his appeals of those losses apparently as new cases Wednesday. For instance, a Philadelphia election day judge had shot down a Trump campaign case over ballot processing access, writing that “observers are directed only to observe and not to audit ballots” and deciding that the city’s board of elections complied with the law. Another Election Day challenge from the Trump campaign to the ballot observation process in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, also near Philly, was dismissed by a judge, though Trump is now appealing, according to Pennsylvania court records.\\n\\nLawyers for the Trump campaign sued in Nevada on Tuesday, too, claiming that their observers were not given enough access to all aspects of the ballot counting process — from opening the ballots, to machine and manual signature checking and duplicating spoiled ballots. A Nevada judge denied the GOP challenge to the early voting process in the heavily Democratic county.\\n\\n“If this last-minute suit were successful, it would require a major change in how [Nevada] processed absentee [ballots] to determine if the signature on the ballot matched the voter’s prior signature on file,” said Richard Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University and CNN election law analyst. “Courts are typically unwilling to let plaintiffs come in the door so late in the day and ask for major changes to a process that’s already well underway.”\\n\\nHowever, one suit, the petition before the US Supreme Court on Pennsylvania’s ballot deadline, may be a more serious litigation challenge. It challenges the validity of potentially several thousand votes cast in good faith by voters, but received by officials after the election through the mail.\\n\\nFor this case to make a difference, Pennsylvania would need to be the deciding state for the election, and the margin of difference between Trump and Biden would need to be a few tens of thousands of votes.\\n\\nCNN’s Maeve Reston and Stephen Collinson contributed to this report.',\n",

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\\n\\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.\\n\\nHaley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,\" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.\\n\\n“I mean, yes, I\\'m a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that\\'s not the American dream, I don\\'t know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can\\'t do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.\\n\\nWhen asked by \"Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”\\n\\n“We\\'re not a racist country, Brian. We\\'ve never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.\\n\\n“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We\\'ve had enough of that in America,” she added.\\n\\nA Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”\\n\\nMore context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Former Vice President Mike Pence participates in a CNN Republican Presidential Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday, June 7. Will Lanzoni/CNN\\n\\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.\\n\\nPence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.\\n\\nHere are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:\\n\\nVladimir Putin and Russia\\'s war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.\\n\\nJanuary 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.\\n\\nSocial Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump\\'s position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden\\'s. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.\\n\\nImmigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration\\'s controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump\\'s comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.\\n\\nAnd here are other key takeaways from the town hall:\\n\\nJustice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.\\n\\nTransgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.\\n\\nPro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country\" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He also offered qualified support for social spending programs to help support newborns and new parents but stopped short of specifically endorsing paid family leave for all Americans or subsidized child care.\\n\\nRead more takeaways here.',\n",

Barry Williams/New York Daily News/Getty Images\\n\\nIn conversations with voters in New York's 3rd Congressional District, many said immigration was a top issue in Tuesday's special election.\\n\\nFor Republicans, the issue represents more than just the border thousands of miles away, it also is a gateway to anxieties voters feel about crime and the economy. Immigration is a topic that Republicans have hammered Democrat Tom Suozzi on during this race. It has also taken on renewed resonance here as a migrant shelter opened on the edge of the district last summer and local headlines recount a spree of crimes migrants are accused of including an attack against the New York Police Department.\\n\\nBut GOP officials admit that the issue may not resonate around the country even as they test drive it here. Suozzi has managed to argue he — not Republican candidate Mazi Pilip — is the only person offering solutions in the race.\\n\\nSuozzi focused much of his campaign on targeting voters who were looking for bipartisan solutions, touting his role in the bipartisan Problem Solver’s Caucus and it’s a message that seemed to resonate.\\n\\nTwo voters who voted for Donald Trump said they were voting for Suozzi because they felt like he was the only candidate they trusted to work across the aisle. Suozzi has centered his defense of immigration on the now-dead Senate border compromise. The same voters said they also liked the fact that Souzzi was a familiar face who was active in the community and had a proven track record whereas PIlip is a relatively unknown commodity.\\n\\nThe issue has dominated the airwaves with Suozzi and his allies releasing five ads on the topic while Pilip and groups supporting her released nine.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'Former US President Donald Trump appears in court with members of his legal team for an arraignment on Tuesday, April 4. (Andrew Kelly/Pool/Reuters)\\n\\nTuesday’s arraignment of former President Donald Trump was a whirlwind of historic firsts.\\n\\nNow the wait begins for the long slog of the judicial system to play out, with the next scheduled actions in court months away.\\n\\nAway from the courthouse, however, Trump quickly went back to attacking Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Judge Juan Merchan, along with their families – raising questions about whether his rhetoric could land him in hot water legally.\\n\\nHere’s what’s next in Trump’s New York criminal case: During Tuesday’s arraignment, prosecutors said they were negotiating the logistics of a “protective order” with Trump’s defense team, which would limit how Trump and his attorneys can use the documents they will be given from the grand jury proceedings during the discovery process.\\n\\nProsecutors specifically said they want to prohibit Trump from posting any discovery materials to social media or sharing them with third parties, such as journalists. They also said they plan to allow Trump to review certain sensitive materials only with his lawyers.\\n\\nTrump’s attorneys will have to agree to the specifics of the agreement, but the exchanges showed the concern in the district attorney’s office about what Trump might say or post about the evidence they hand over.\\n\\n“The entirety of the prosecution’s case file will soon have to be turned over to the defense,” Agnifilo said. “Prosecutors don’t want it made public because they’re focused on the proceedings and know Trump will try this in the court of public opinion way before any trial in a court. That’s where the integrity of the proceedings can get really dicey — and that’s what they’re trying to accomplish with a protective order.”\\n\\nWhen could a trial actually start? If the case goes to trial, it’s not going to be until next year — when Trump could be in the thick of the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\\n\\nMerchan set an August 8 deadline for Trump’s lawyers to file motions in the case — such as an attempt to get the charges dismissed or reduced to misdemeanors. Prosecutors will have until September 19 to respond, and then Merchan expects to rule on the motions at the December hearing.\\n\\nThe next hearing date for the case is December 4.\\n\\nProsecutors asked Merchan to plan on a trial beginning in January 2024, but Trump’s attorneys suggested that the spring might be more realistic, given they had not yet received any documents in the case.\\n\\nMerchan seemed to side with Trump’s lawyers.\\n\\n“I understand what you are saying,” Merchan said. “I think that is reasonable. You have not received discovery. It is difficult to anticipate if you will be ready for trial in January of 2024. The message I would like to deliver is we would like to move ahead as expeditiously as possible, without undue delay.”\\n\\nRead more.',\n",

Her father, Republican Mike Huckabee, was governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. And by defeating Democrat Chris Jones, Sanders will also become the first daughter in US history to serve as governor of the same state her father once led.\\n\\nSanders previously worked for two years in the George W. Bush administration and later ran her father’s 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and then was campaign manager for his 2016 bid.\\n\\nShe gained national prominence in her role as former President Donald Trump’s White House press secretary, serving as a staunch defender of the then-President and his policies for more than two years. On many occasions, she clashed with national reporters and eventually scaled back televised briefings. She defended the move, saying that journalists could hear from Trump directly.\\n\\nSanders earned an early endorsement from Trump after joining the race for Arkansas governor, and prominent rivals later dropped out of the race, clearing her path to the GOP nomination.\\n\\nSanders’ path to victory in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov.

(Jason Bean/Reno Gazette Journal/USA Today Network)\\n\\nVice President Kamala Harris will make the case for President Joe Biden’s 2024 reelection bid Tuesday at a political rally on reproductive freedom, a Harris adviser told CNN, saying that \"finishing the job\" is about fighting to protect abortion and other rights facing nationwide restrictions.\\n\\nHarris will \"highlight the extremism of elected Republicans and the unrelenting attacks on women and healthcare providers state by state,\" the adviser said.\\n\\nThe rally draws an immediate contrast with Biden, who is likely to shun more campaign-style events in the coming months. Earlier, a Biden adviser previously told CNN, \"he’s just gonna keep doing his schedule.\"\\n\\nThe event at the vice president’s alma mater Howard University will be a high-profile moment for Harris, crystallizing her role as the administration’s lead messenger in its efforts to safeguard access to abortion on a day where all eyes are on the White House following Biden’s announcement. Abortion rights protests were featured prominently in Biden’s long-awaited reelection campaign announcement video.\\n\\nBut Biden and Harris face significant political headwinds in their bid for a second term, including low approval numbers and an unenthusiastic American electorate. A majority of voters, recent polling shows, does not want Biden to seek a second term, citing age as a major factor.\\n\\nStill, the president said in his Tuesday video that \"the question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer,\" a clear indication that issues like abortion will loom large in his argument to American voters. Abortion rights were a motivating issue for Democrats during the 2022 midterm election, and Biden officials hope to utilize the same energy in 2024.\\n\\n\"It’s a winning issue for them,\" a source close to the vice president’s office told CNN.\\n\\nMore about the vice president\\'s remarks: Harris is expected to \"describe the moment we’re in,\" according to the adviser. She will address what the adviser called \"extremist\" Republicans who seek to make abortion bans federal law. She’ll also discuss book bans, voting rights and gun safety, the adviser said.\\n\\nHarris’ Tuesday remarks also come less than a week after the Supreme Court issued a brief protecting access to medication abortion and blocking a court ruling that revoked the US Food and Drug Administration\\'s approval of the drug mifepristone while an appeal works its way through lower courts.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Former President Donald Trump has made numerous false and unsupported claims about the federal investigation into his handling of government documents, a probe he announced Thursday has resulted in his indictment.\\n\\nHere is a fact check of the claims Trump has made about the investigation since the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago resort and residence in August 2022.\\n\\nFalse claim: Trump was following the Presidential Records Act by refusing to immediately return documents\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that the Presidential Records Act, a 1978 law, says he was supposed to hold negotiations with the National Archives and Records Administration about the return of official documents after his presidency.\\n\\nFor example, he said in a March 2023 interview on Fox that the law is “very specific”: “It says you are going to discuss the documents. You discuss everything – not only docu– everything – about what’s going in NARA, et cetera, et cetera. You’re gonna discuss it. You will talk, talk, talk. And if you can’t come to an agreement, you’re gonna continue to talk.”\\n\\nHe made a similar claim at a CNN town hall in May, saying the law “says you talk, you negotiate, you make a deal.”\\n\\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is false. The Presidential Records Act says that, the moment a president leaves office, NARA gets custody and control of all presidential records from his administration. Nothing in the law says there should be a negotiation between a former president and NARA over a former president’s return of presidential documents – much less that there should have been a monthslong battle after NARA first contacted Trump’s team in 2021 to try to get some of the records that had not been handed over at the end of his presidency.\\n\\nThe key sentence from the Presidential Records Act is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”\\n\\nFalse claim: Obama, the Bushes and others took millions of documents home with them after leaving office\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that he has been singled out by federal law enforcement even though his predecessors as president all took documents with them after leaving office.\\n\\nFor example, Trump claimed in the fall of 2022 that former presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush all took millions of documents; he repeated the claim that Obama took documents at the CNN town hall in May. He also claimed that George H.W. Bush took his documents to a poorly secured Chinese restaurant and bowling alley.\\n\\nFacts First: This is all false, as NARA itself pointed out in a statement in 2022. In reality, NARA was granted custody of the presidential records of former presidents (beginning with Ronald Reagan as soon as these presidents left office) as soon as these presidents left office, as required by the Presidential Records Act, and it was NARA, not those presidents, that moved those documents out of the nation’s capital to NARA-managed temporary archival facilities near where their permanent presidential libraries would be built. The NARA-managed facility where records from the George H.W. Bush administration were stored was indeed a former restaurant and bowling alley, but it had been turned into a full-fledged archival facility, and professionally secured in various ways, by the time the documents were moved in.\\n\\nRead more here',\n",

The investigational cocktail, known by its investigational name REGN-COV2, has been in clinical trials since June.\\n\\nRemdesivir: President Trump is being given a five-day course of the antiviral drug remdesivir, one of the doctors treating him said during a briefing on Saturday. The treatment is intended to shorten recovery time for Covid-19 patients.

       "    'text': 'Sources familiar with the matter tell CNN that it appears that the suspected Chinese spy balloon movements appear to rely primarily on the jet stream, allowing Beijing to predict its likely path.\\n\\nChina can control the surveillance balloon to an extent, for example by turning on and off the surveillance gear inside of it, the sources said. The fact that China does have some control over the balloon’s capabilities is why the US government has raised their concerns with Beijing about it, the sources said.\\n\\nWhat US officials are saying: The balloon’s surveillance equipment appears to be powered by a solar array, one US official said, which would provide the system with a reliable source of power at high altitude. But the solar array does not appear to be connected to any type of motor that would allow China to steer the balloon, the official added.\\n\\nPentagon officials said they did not believe the balloon had surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities above and beyond Chinese spy satellites in low earth orbit, but unlike satellites that pass rapidly over a location every 90 minutes, a spy balloon can loiter over a spot and gather more of a “pattern of life” of a particular site, the official said.\\n\\nIn the past, the US has simply allowed balloons like this to waft away, without taking any action or publicizing their presence over the US, the sources said. It is also not the first time a surveillance balloon has appeared over the United States.\\n\\nThe US official said there were similar incidents with suspected Chinese surveillance balloons over Hawaii and Guam in recent years. On Thursday, a senior defense official said, “Instances of this activity have been observed over the past several years, including prior to this administration.”\\n\\nThe US government now believes that it has gotten China’s attention about the balloon, and that the matter could be resolved soon, the sources said.',\n",

       "    'text': \"Former President Donald Trump participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on Wednesday, May 10. Will Lanzoni/CNN\\n\\nThe 2024 presidential campaign is only beginning, but former President Donald Trump made clear that his third bid for the White House will feel very much like the first two.\\n\\nTrump might be trying a new tack in this campaign, running what is, to date, a more conventional race with less internal drama. But when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, the 76-year-old showed on Wednesday night that he is very much the same person Americans came to know in 2016, throughout his four years in office, and in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the mostly Trump-loyal audience lapped it up. Trump’s place in the GOP primary polls, as he often mentioned, is strong. In New Hampshire on Wednesday night, he showed why.\\n\\nHere are some takeaways from Trump’s CNN town hall:\\n\\nTrump says GOP should be willing to blow up debt ceiling: The US is on the brink of a catastrophic default on its sovereign debt. Asked what his advice is to Republicans in Washington, Trump was clear. “If they don’t give you massive cuts,” he said, “you’re going to have to do a default.” The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking so-called extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.\\n\\nTrump makes dismissive comments about Carroll: A little more than 24 hours after a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, and awarded her $5 million, the former president denied the accusations and again said he had never met Carroll. “This woman, I don’t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is,” Trump said, before going off on an odd tangent about her former husband and a pet.\\n\\nTrump also brushed off a question over whether the verdict would hurt his standing with female voters, saying he doubted it. The reaction from the Trump-friendly audience appeared to support his opinion – they laughed at his jokes and other dismissive comments about Carroll.\\n\\nTrump doesn’t say if he would back Ukraine in war with Russia: Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to prevail in its war with invading Russia.“I don’t think in terms of winning and losing,” he said, “I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people.” Asked to choose a side he would prefer to win, Trump again demurred. “I want everyone to stop dying,” he said before promising to end the war in “24 hours.”\\n\\nTrump suggests family separation immigration policy could return: Trump said he would return to one of the harshest immigration enforcement policies imposed by his administration: separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said. His comments come as Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restriction that became a key tool officials used to expel migrants at the US-Mexico border, is set to expire Thursday.\\n\\nTrump was vague on federal abortion ban: Trump repeatedly ducked questions about whether he would sign into law a federal abortion ban, as well as questions regarding after how many weeks into a pregnancy abortion should be made illegal. He touted the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion rights as “such a great victory” – and one made possible by his appointment of three conservative justices. Trump said he supports exemptions to abortion bans for cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is threatened. “We now have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done,” Trump said.\\n\\nRead more takeaways from tonight's town hall here and read our team's fact checks here.\",\n",

       "    'text': \"Former President Donald Trump attends a primary election night party at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Columbia on Saturday. Andrew Harnik/AP\\n\\nDonald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.\\n\\nThe race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.\\n\\nTrump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.\\n\\nWhere does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.\\n\\nNikki Haley arrives to speaks to supporters after the South Carolina presidential primary on Saturday in Charleston. Chris Carlson/AP\\n\\nA big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.\\n\\nTim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.\",\n",

       "    'text': \"The sleeping area at the Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center on August 15, 2023, in Queens, New York. Barry Williams/New York Daily News/Getty Images\\n\\nIn conversations with voters in New York's 3rd Congressional District, many said immigration was a top issue in Tuesday's special election.\\n\\nFor Republicans, the issue represents more than just the border thousands of miles away, it also is a gateway to anxieties voters feel about crime and the economy. Immigration is a topic that Republicans have hammered Democrat Tom Suozzi on during this race. It has also taken on renewed resonance here as a migrant shelter opened on the edge of the district last summer and local headlines recount a spree of crimes migrants are accused of including an attack against the New York Police Department.\\n\\nBut GOP officials admit that the issue may not resonate around the country even as they test drive it here. Suozzi has managed to argue he — not Republican candidate Mazi Pilip — is the only person offering solutions in the race.\\n\\nSuozzi focused much of his campaign on targeting voters who were looking for bipartisan solutions, touting his role in the bipartisan Problem Solver’s Caucus and it’s a message that seemed to resonate.\\n\\nTwo voters who voted for Donald Trump said they were voting for Suozzi because they felt like he was the only candidate they trusted to work across the aisle. Suozzi has centered his defense of immigration on the now-dead Senate border compromise. The same voters said they also liked the fact that Souzzi was a familiar face who was active in the community and had a proven track record whereas PIlip is a relatively unknown commodity.\\n\\nThe issue has dominated the airwaves with Suozzi and his allies releasing five ads on the topic while Pilip and groups supporting her released nine.\",\n",

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP\\n\\nIn an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.\\n\\n“It\\'s interesting that we\\'re here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: \\'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,\\'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.\\n\\n“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,\" she continued. \"I don\\'t need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don\\'t need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who\\'s ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”\\n\\nThe defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it\\'s critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.\\n\\nIn court filings, defendant Mike Roman\\'s team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.\\n\\nWillis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.',\n",

I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again — this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said.\\n\\nTrump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in South Carolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.”\\n\\nFacts First: Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in New York on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances.\\n\\nRather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a hearing related to charges he faces in Georgia.\\n\\nAnd he had not been scheduled to be in South Carolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the New York hearing. His next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week.

And in fiscal year 2022, according to the Department of Homeland Security, 1.4 million individuals who were encountered at the border were removed, which is more than in any previous year.\\n\\nThe border crisis has galvanized Republicans, unifying their party for more aggressive action on an issue central to the 2024 campaign, and a handful of the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to scuttle an effort to impeach Mayorkas in November 2023 recently signaled they’d back impeaching him if it went through the committee process, which happened late last month.\\n\\nModerate Republicans, including ones in districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020, also signaled more willingness to impeach Mayorkas than the president – a sign of the shifting political terrain on the issue.\\n\\nWhile House Republicans have sought to use Mayorkas' impeachment to address their issues with Biden's handling of the border, the GOP also helped to tank – along with Donald Trump – a major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package that would have marked a tough change to immigration law championed by one of the Senate's most conservative members. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber, even if it ever made it out of the Senate.\\n\\nMayorkas wrote in a letter in advance of the vote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.”\\n\\nCNN's Melanie Zanona, Manu Raju and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.\",\n",

       "    'text': \"Following the Manhattan grand jury's indictment of former President Donald Trump, it’s worth looking at the mechanics of what’s going on in the legal system and how the process that applies to everyone is being applied to Trump.\\n\\nWe spoke to Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor and author of the new book, “Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away With It,” for a refresher on how grand juries and indictments work. Part of our conversation, conducted by phone, is below:\\n\\nGrand jury vs. trial jury\\n\\nWOLF: What should we know about the difference between a grand jury and a trial jury?\\n\\nHONIG: A grand jury decides to indict, meaning to charge a case. A trial jury determines guilt or non-guilt.\\n\\nA grand jury is bigger, typically 23 members, and the prosecutor only needs the votes of a majority of a grand jury — as opposed to a trial jury, which has to be unanimous.\\n\\nThe standard of proof in a grand jury is lower than a trial jury. In a grand jury, you only have to show probable cause, meaning more likely than not. But of course in a trial setting, you need to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\nThe other thing to know is a grand jury is an almost entirely one-sided process.\\n\\nUsually the only people allowed in the room at all are the grand jurors, the prosecutors, the witnesses and a court reporter.\\n\\nIn some instances, including New York, there’s a limited right of a potential defendant to present some evidence, but no defense lawyers are allowed in the room.\\n\\nThere’s no cross-examination of the prosecution’s evidence. There’s no presentation of defense evidence.\\n\\nClose to every time a prosecutor seeks an indictment from a grand jury, he or she will get an indictment from the grand jury.\\n\\nWhat is an indictment?\\n\\nWOLF: How would you define “indictment”?\\n\\nHONIG: It’s a document setting forth formal charges against the defendant.\\n\\n3 Trump grand juries\\n\\nWOLF: We have three grand juries that are top of mind — for election meddling in Georgia, at the federal level for declassified documents and then the Manhattan DA. How much variation is there in grand juries between city, county and federal?\\n\\nHONIG: There are minor variations, but the basics remain the same.\\n\\nHere’s an example of one of the minor variations in New York State, but not in the federal system, meaning for DOJ. The defendant does have some limited right to be notified and given a chance to testify or present defense evidence, which we saw play out with Trump and then him asking Robert Costello to testify.\\n\\nThat’s not the case federally. You do not have to give a defendant a chance to testify or present evidence. That’s one slight variation. But the basic fundamentals are the same.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Waterloo, Iowa, on December 19. Charlie Neibergall/AP\\n\\nThe Colorado Supreme Court made history Tuesday with an unprecedented, freeze-in-your-tracks ruling that former President Donald Trump is constitutionally ineligible to run in 2024 because the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office covers his conduct on January 6, 2021.\\n\\nThe 4-3 decision removes Trump from the Republican primary ballot in Colorado, which is scheduled for Super Tuesday in early March. However, the Colorado justices paused their ruling so Trump can appeal to the US Supreme Court, which could even preserve his spot on the state’s primary ballot if the appeal isn’t settled quickly.\\n\\nIn many ways, the landmark ruling holds Trump accountable for trying to overturn the 2020 election and provides a political punishment for his anti-democratic behavior. The ruling is also a massive vindication for the liberal groups and constitutional scholars of all stripes who championed such 14th Amendment lawsuits despite their long odds.\\n\\nHere are the key takeaways from the decision and what comes next:\\n\\nTrump engaged in insurrection, court says: The top Colorado court upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the January 6 assault on the US Capitol was an insurrection and that Trump “engaged in” that insurrection.\\n\\nThese are key legal hurdles that the challengers needed to clear before Trump could be removed from any ballot, largely because the text of the 14th Amendment doesn’t actually define an “insurrection” or spell out what it means to “engage in” insurrection.\\n\\nThe justices also affirmed the decision that Trump’s January 6 speech at the Ellipse was not protected by the First Amendment. Trump has unsuccessfully pushed this argument in state and federal courts, which found that he incited violence when he told supporters to “walk down to the Capitol” and “fight like hell” to “take back our country.”\\n\\nThe \"insurrectionist ban\" does apply to Trump: The justices broke from the trial judge on one key issue, reversing her controversial decision that the “insurrectionist ban” applies to every office except the presidency.\\n\\nSection 3 of the 14th Amendment says oath-breaking insurrectionists can’t serve as senators, representatives, presidential electors, “or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State.” But it doesn’t mention the presidency.\\n\\nThis textual vagueness is why the trial judge kept Trump on the 2024 ballot. But the high court disagreed. And this was the linchpin of their decision to disqualify Trump.\\n\\nThe US Supreme Court will have the ultimate say: Everyone knows this isn’t the final word. The case is headed to the US Supreme Court.\\n\\nIt’s anyone’s guess how the justices will handle the case. How fast will they decide to take up the appeal? Will they hold oral arguments? How quickly will they issue a final decision? The answers to these questions will have implications for the political calendar, with the Iowa caucuses kicking off the GOP primary season in less than a month.\\n\\nRead more on the takeaways from the historic ruling.',\n",

       "    'text': 'CNN —\\n\\nBefore Americans pick a president in November, they get to pick the candidates in a series of primaries and caucuses.\\n\\nIt’s a wonky process that has evolved over the course of the country’s history and continues to evolve today.\\n\\nHere’s what to know:\\n\\nWhat is a primary?\\n\\nIt’s an election to select candidates, usually for a particular political party, to appear on the general election ballot. Primaries award delegates, and candidates must reach a magic number of delegates to win the nomination and appear on the general election ballot in November.\\n\\nWho is ahead in the primaries?\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump has long been the leader in polls for the Republican presidential primary, and he has the most delegates after the contest in Iowa. A large field of challengers has winnowed down to one major opponent, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who may have her best shot at beating Trump in New Hampshire’s primary.\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden is the incumbent president and all but a lock to win the Democratic nomination, but he won’t even appear on the ballot in New Hampshire due to a disagreement between national Democrats and the state party over which primary should come first. Biden could still win New Hampshire’s primary through a write-in campaign, but the first sanctioned Democratic contest is in South Carolina in February.\\n\\nWhen will we know who will win the primaries?\\n\\nKeep an eye on Super Tuesday, March 5. While there won’t yet be enough delegates on the table to clinch the nomination, that is the night with the largest pot of delegates, where Republicans in 16 states and territories will vote for president.\\n\\nIt might take until May or June for one candidate to secure enough votes to win his or her party’s nomination. The last presidential primaries occur on June 4.\\n\\nThe earliest a candidate could mathematically win enough delegates to be the nominee is March 12.\\n\\nWho can vote in a presidential primary?\\n\\nIt varies by state. Primaries are generally conducted in polling places like any other election.\\n\\nBut some states have “open primaries,” meaning any registered voter can vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary. Other states have “closed primaries,” meaning only people registered in a particular political party – usually Republicans or Democrats – can vote in that party’s primary.\\n\\nOthers offer voting day registration, which essentially opens the primaries to most registered voters.\\n\\nWhen do the presidential primaries occur?\\n\\nThe first date on the presidential primary calendar was January 15, although it was not technically for a primary.\\n\\nOn that day in Iowa, Republican Party members gathered at events called caucuses, which are overseen by state parties and not conducted like normal elections. Trump won decisively.\\n\\nDemocrats also gathered that day in Iowa, but their vote for president is conducted by mail ending on March 5.\\n\\nAfter Iowa, New Hampshire holds its “first-in-the-nation” primary on January 23, although Democrats are not sanctioning the event.\\n\\nThe calendar spreads out from there. Republicans compete in caucuses in Nevada and the US Virgin Islands on February 8 and South Carolina on February 24.\\n\\nIn some states, presidential primaries are conducted on one date and primaries for other offices are conducted later in the year. See the full calendar.\\n\\nDelegates can either be apportioned through a winner-take-all system, meaning the top candidate in a state’s primary gets all of that state’s delegates, or they can be apportioned proportionally to the primary election results. Some states have thresholds where every candidate who gets over a certain amount of the vote – say, 20% – may be entitled to delegates.\\n\\nIn this February 2020 photo, then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks during the 100 Club Dinner at SNHIU in Manchester, New Hampshire.

States with primaries and caucuses after March 15 may switch to a winner-take-all format.\\n\\nDelegates are mostly required to be “bound” (the Republican term) or “pledged” (the Democratic term) to a particular candidate heading into the convention.\\n\\nA very small portion of delegates in certain states and territories on the Republican side are “unbound.” These few delegates can support whomever they choose at the outset of the convention.\\n\\nDemocrats have “unpledged” delegates – party bigwigs – but they do not cast ballots in the first round of voting on the convention floor if they could impact the outcome.\\n\\nIf there’s no clear majority winner after the delegates vote, they go to additional rounds of voting where the bound delegates become unbound so that they can ultimately select a nominee. This is what’s known as a “brokered convention.”\\n\\nWhen we say this is rare, we mean it hasn’t happened since 1952.\\n\\nIn this July 2016 photo, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and then-Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence acknowledge the crowd at the end of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\\n\\nHow did this process come about?\\n\\nIt evolved over the course of the country’s history. It used to be congressional delegations who would select presidential candidates.\\n\\nThe first election for which there were political conventions for party members was 1832, when Andrew Jackson won the White House. The first convention was held by the short-lived and long-defunct Anti-Masonic Party.\\n\\nThe move toward focusing on primary elections and making the system more democratic began after violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, when party leaders had opted for then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey over anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy. (Humphrey went on to lose to Richard Nixon.)\\n\\nWhere and when are the 2024 conventions?\\n\\nThe Republican National Convention runs July 15-18 in Milwaukee.\\n\\nThe Democratic National Convention runs August 19-22 in Chicago.\\n\\nAre there primaries that are not so focused on political parties?\\n\\nYes, but not for the office of president.\\n\\nA growing number of states are experimenting with nonpartisan primaries, where all voters and candidates take part in one primary election and the top finishers, regardless of their party affiliation, square off on Election Day.\\n\\nThese nonpartisan primaries, which feature in statewide races for Senate and governor and for House races, are not used in the presidential election.\\n\\nCalifornia, Nebraska and Washington use the top-two system. Alaska has a top-four system.\\n\\nLouisiana has so-called “jungle primaries.” All candidates for local, state or federal office are listed on the Election Day ballot, and if no candidate gets a majority, the top-two finishers take part in a runoff.\\n\\nYes. The Green Party will likely have a presidential candidate on the ballot in most states, and the Libertarian Party expects to be on the ballot in all 50 states. These parties will select their nominees in their own conventions.\\n\\nThe last time a third-party or independent candidate secured electoral votes in a general election, however, was 1968.\\n\\nDo the winners in Iowa and New Hampshire usually win the party’s nomination?\\n\\nNot necessarily. In 2020, Biden didn’t win either Iowa or New Hampshire, but his campaign got a reset in South Carolina and he went on to the Democratic nomination and the White House.\\n\\nIn 2016, Trump lost Iowa but won New Hampshire, similar to fellow Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama won Iowa, but lost New Hampshire. Republican John McCain lost Iowa that year but won New Hampshire.\\n\\nThe last candidate to win both in Iowa and New Hampshire and go on to the White House was Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, although he technically placed second in Iowa, behind “uncommitted.”\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional information.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN\\n\\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.\\n\\nIn the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.\\n\\nHere are takeaways from the CNN town hall:\\n\\nFocusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.\\n\\nHe took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.\\n\\nIt continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.\\n\\nIt was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.\\n\\nDeSantis says Trump is \"flip-flopping\" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”\\n\\nHe argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.\\n\\nThe six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.\\n\\nHe then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”\\n\\nOn a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.\\n\\nBiden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.\\n\\nDeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”\\n\\n“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”\\n\\nDeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.\\n\\nDeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.\\n\\nSimilarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.\\n\\nRead more of the key moments from the Iowa town hall with Ron DeSantis.',\n",

Ken Buck who previously said he was leaning against it.\\n\\nPart of the reason for Wednesday’s vote comes from the White House telling the trio of GOP-led congressional committees leading the investigation that its subpoenas were illegitimate without a formal House vote to authorize the inquiry, reluctant, more moderate Republican lawmakers started to get on board with their party’s investigative efforts.\\n\\nThe vote comes as the president's son Hunter Biden defied Republican investigator’s subpoena for closed-door testimony and reiterated that he is willing to testify publicly as part of the GOP-led investigation into the president.\\n\\nBut even as the majority of House Republicans rally around the inquiry vote, GOP leadership has made a point to indicate that formalizing the inquiry does not mean impeaching the president is inevitable, even as pressure within the party and among the Republican base grows.\\n\\n“We’re not going to prejudge the outcome of this because we can’t,” Johnson told reporters Tuesday. “It’s not a political calculation. We’re following the law and we are the rule of law team and I’m going to hold to that.”\\n\\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, echoed Johnson’s sentiment by telling reporters, “Voting in favor of an impeachment inquiry does not equal impeachment.”\\n\\nMore on the inquiry: Since former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry in September, a trio of committees leading the investigation have interviewed various officials from the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service while also obtaining a mountain of documents and new bank records, including from Biden family members.\\n\\nEven as Republicans issue new subpoenas and schedule more depositions, including with the president’s brother and son, they still have not uncovered credible evidence that backs up their loftiest claims against Biden. There has only been one hearing related to the inquiry since its launch, where the expert witnesses called by Republicans acknowledged GOP investigators hadn’t yet presented enough evidence to prove the accusations they were leveling.\",\n",

Rebecca Blackwell/AP\\n\\nJudge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.\\n\\nEngoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.\\n\\n“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.\\n\\nHere are key takeaways from the decision:\\n\\nThe biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx.

       "    'text': 'Members of the public enter the Supreme Court to attend oral arguments on Monday. Francis Chung/E&E News/Politico/AP\\n\\nConservative Supreme Court justices were hostile on Monday to the ongoing use of race-based affirmative action in college admissions.\\n\\nThe court took nearly five hours to debate affirmative action policies at the University of North Carolina and Harvard.\\n\\nBased on Monday’s oral arguments, the six conservative justices appear ready to end the use of affirmative action in admissions, overturning a precedent from 1978.\\n\\nHere are key takeaways from today\\'s oral arguments:\\n\\nConservatives say defenders of affirmative action can’t articulate an end point\\n\\nThe conservative wing of the court harped on the lack of clarity around when the need for affirmative action would end. Multiple justices asked Ryan Park, the North Carolina Solicitor General who is defending the UNC admissions program, to elaborate on how to measure that a school has achieved the diversity goals that would render affirmative action unnecessary.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see how you can say that the program will ever end,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said during a pile-on that also included Justices Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett. \"Your position is that race matters because it\\'s necessary for diversity, which is necessary for the sort of education you want. It\\'s not going to stop mattering at some particular point, you\\'re always going to have to look at race because you say race matters to give us the necessary diversity.\"\\n\\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said the court will struggle if they are asked to review affirmative action again in 10 years, “if you don’t have something measurable” that shows whether the diversity goals have been achieved.\\n\\nThomas questions educational benefit of racial diversity\\n\\nJustice Clarence Thomas asked all three lawyers arguing in favor of UNC\\'s affirmative action program — Park, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and David Hinojosa, who is representing UNC students defending the program — to explain how racial diversity benefits the educational experience students receive.\\n\\n“I may be tone deaf when it comes to all these other things that happen on campus, about feeling good and all that,” Thomas said to Hinojosa. “I\\'m really interested in a simple thing. .. what benefits academically are there to your definition or the diversity that you\\'re asserting?”\\n\\nWhen he posed the question to Park, Thomas suggests that Park’s response reminded him of the arguments he heard in favor of segregation.\\n\\nJackson says barring all consideration of race invites its own constitutional problems\\n\\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson warned that if colleges are prohibited from making any consideration of race, it risks violating the Constitution’s equal protection protections for students who will not be able to present that background in their applications.\\n\\n“I hear a process in which there\\'s a form that says tell us about yourself and people can put all sorts of things. I\\'m Catholic, I\\'m from, you know, Los Angeles, I\\'m Latina, whatever,” she said. “But now we\\'re — we\\'re entertaining a rule in which some people can say the things they want, about who they are and have that valued in the system. But other people are not going to be able to. Because they won\\'t be able to reveal that they\\'re Latino or African American or whatever. And I\\'m worried that that creates an inequity in the system.”\\n\\nSotomayor points to how states that bar affirmative action have fared\\n\\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor returned repeatedly to the statistics coming the schools in states that have barred affirmative action.\\n\\nAt one point, she raised those trends to push back on conservatives’ invocation of the 25-year timeline the Supreme Court set, in its 2003 ruling sanctioning the use of race in admissions, for affirmative action programs to no longer be necessary.\\n\\n“Even your adversary said he didn\\'t see the 25 years as a set deadline. It was an expectation,” Sotomayor said to Park. “What we know we have nine states who have tried it and in each of them as I mentioned earlier, whites have either, white admissions have either, remained the same or increased. And clearly, in some institutions, the numbers for underrepresented groups has fallen dramatically, correct?”\\n\\nHarvard grilled on allegations of discrimination against Asian applicants\\n\\nWhile the justices raised many of the same issues in the Harvard case\\'s hearing as they did in the early UNC lawsuit arguments, Harvard attorney Seth Waxman got a grilling on the specific allegations of discrimination against Asian applicants -- allegations only being brought in the Harvard case.\\n\\nAlito pressed Waxman extensively on the evidence that Asian applicants received lower personal ratings in the admissions process than other racial groups. Waxman\\'s attempts to emphasize that race was an important factor in very few of the admission decisions prompted Roberts to remark sharply \"So there\\'s only a little racial discrimination in the case?\"\\n\\nRoberts also had a pointed retort in Waxman compared the advantage an applicant might get because of their race to the advantage Harvard would give an oboe player if the school\\'s orchestra was in need of that instrument.',\n",

       "    'text': \"Former President Donald Trump gestures while speaking in Nashville, Tennessee on February 22. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump’s trial in his election interference case in Washington, DC, is indefinitely postponed during ongoing appeals about presidential immunity.\\n\\nBut the judge who will oversee the trial has hinted at a quick timetable once the case returns to her jurisdiction. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has suggested in the past that there are about three months left of pre-trial work to be done before a trial could start.\\n\\nChutkan originally set the trial to begin on March 4 but delayed that date until the matter of whether Trump should be immune from prosecution is settled by appeals courts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments on the issue in April and is expected to issue a ruling by the end of the term in June.\\n\\nThe judge made clear in her order delaying the March trial date that she would revisit the timetable when those appeals are settled, and only then will new deadlines or trial dates be made official.\\n\\nHere's what to know about the timing of this trial:\\n\\nWho decides when a trial happens? This is entirely up to the courts. The judge overseeing the trial can take into consideration arguments from prosecutors and defense teams about when a trial can happen, but it’s the judge’s call at the end of the day.\\n\\nWould Election Day put a fall trial on hold? Almost certainly no. Nothing on a political calendar would block a trial from happening. Trump’s team has tried to claim that the cases against him are “election interference” and repeatedly argued in court he should not face a jury while he is campaigning for president, but multiple judges overseeing his cases have rejected this idea. Chutkan previously told Trump’s lawyers his desire to conduct a campaign would have to yield in some ways to the needs of the justice system. She called his campaign a “day job” at an early hearing.\\n\\nCould Trump still go to trial on federal 2020 election charges before the election? Yes. It’s possible, and even likely, that if the Supreme Court were to green-light a trial by the end of the court’s term in June, Trump would go to trial before the election. In that scenario, Chutkan could set the trial for a few weeks out once the immunity question is resolved. She has already worked through many of the pretrial issues in the case, with only a few still in limbo while the appeals have been ongoing.\\n\\nTrump has no other ability to muster additional appeals to slow down this case before trial. And with only four counts against him as a sole defendant, it wouldn’t be out of line for the DC District Court to hold Trump’s trial about a year after he was initially charged, as the court does with many of its criminal defendants. If the Supreme Court agrees with Trump on presidential immunity, however, the case against him could be dismissed.\",\n",

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\\n\\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley offered harsh criticism of former President Donald Trump, saying if he clinches the GOP nomination it “is like suicide for our country.”\\n\\n“This may be his survival mode to pay his legal fees and get out of some sort of legal peril, but this is like suicide for our country. We’ve got to realize that if we don’t have someone who can win a general election, all we are doing is caving to the socialist left,” Haley said during an interview with the Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nWhen making the case that he can’t win a general election, Haley has often pointed to Trump’s mounting legal troubles, which include 91 criminal charges for matters surrounding his handling of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Following Trump\\'s $355 million civil fraud verdict earlier this month, Haley claimed the RNC could possibly become the \"piggy bank\" funding the former president’s legal fees.\\n\\nDespite losing in four states to Trump, Haley has doubled down on questioning his electability. During an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan on Tuesday morning, the former South Carolina governor highlighted that while the former president won in early states, “he did not get 40% of the Republican primary vote.”\\n\\n“You can\\'t win a general election without the 40%,” she said, referring to her share of the vote in the South Carolina GOP primary.',\n",

Two of the Big Three companies, GM and Chrysler, went bankrupt in 2009 and needed federal bailouts to survive.\\n\\nThat took a bite not only out of employment, but out of auto wages, as the United Auto Workers union agreed to deep concessions, including a lower tier of wages, to help keep all three companies alive. But that helped drag down wages in the state overall.\\n\\nThe state’s median household income was higher than the national average until 2000, according to the Growing Michigan Together Council, a group formed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to develop solutions to Michigan’s challenges. The state’s median income declined relative to the US level over the past five decades.\\n\\nToday, the median household income in the state was just under $67,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau.\\n\\nHowever, following a six-week strike last fall at GM, Ford and Stellantis, the United Auto Workers union won immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members. Pay for members is expected to rise more than 30% during the life of the contract, which expires in 2028.\\n\\nWhile jobs in the state’s auto and parts plants have stabilized in recent years, jobs in the manufacturing sector overall have edged up by 4.5% since the end of 2020. But that still hasn’t recaptured jobs lost in that sector during the first year of the pandemic. Overall employment in the state in December was up 9.6% from the end of 2020, but still off 0.5% from December of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Michigan also faces serious challenges as automakers plan to shift to electric vehicles, or EVs',\n",

Not specifically in relation to the SOCFs—yeah statement of condition,\" Harris answered in the transcript.\\n\\nDuring this exchange, Trump attorneys and Eric Trump who was in the courtroom nodded along and Trump’s son looked back at the press in the galley.\\n\\nTrump’s attorneys did not cross-examine Harris but reserved the right to call him during the defense case.\\n\\nWhen Bender resumed cross-examination late in the afternoon, Suarez seemed to pare down his questioning enough to avoid any further admonishment from the judge.\\n\\nBender is expected to continue cross-examination Thursday morning, his fourth day on the stand.

Nancy Mace of South Carolina: If you vote to oust McCarthy, the party might not be willing to help raise money for your race.\\n\\nThe warning to Mace, which was described by a source familiar with the conversation, is a sign of just how seriously the speaker drama has rankled the Republican party, with money often used as a powerful carrot – or stick – in Washington.\\n\\nYet Mace, a Republican who could face a competitive race and will need a well-funded campaign war chest to win reelection, ultimately joined seven other GOP lawmakers and all Democrats to sink McCarthy. And it’s not the only repercussion she could now be facing for her career-defining moment of defiance: Sources told CNN that there’s discussion among members on the Republican Governance Group about voting to kick her out of the moderate-leaning group.\\n\\nIt’s just one of many examples of the fallout from Tuesday’s stunning vote to remove the sitting speaker, which has reverberated through both sides of the Capitol and left a bitterly divided GOP scrambling to pick up the pieces. Much of the furor is directed at Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, the ringleader of the McCarthy rebellion. But Republicans are also turning their fire on their Democratic colleagues as well, furious that they sided with Gaetz to throw the House into chaos and let McCarthy be punished for funding the government with their votes.\\n\\nAnd it all comes as a GOP leadership scramble to succeed McCarthy has begun to take shape, even as rank-and-file Republicans warn the speaker candidates that there is ample work that must be done to repair the frayed relations within their badly divided conference.\\n\\nRep. Kelly Armstrong, a North Dakota Republican and a close McCarthy ally, said there are a “lot of raw nerves” and that the next speaker candidates must make clear that they will “never” allow a single GOP member to oust a sitting speaker again.\\n\\n“The next speaker better figure out how to negotiate with the exotics before you become speaker because you’re sure as hell gonna have to do it after you’re speaker,” Armstrong said.\\n\\n“This isn’t a normal election,” he said of the speaker’s race. “And I think too many people are treating it like one.”\\n\\nThe high-stakes drama has not only sparked threats to remove GOP colleagues from the conference but also put key bipartisan working relationships in jeopardy ahead of another looming government funding deadline and prompted serious internal conversations about overhauling the House rules, further complicating any candidates’ bid to win the gavel.\\n\\n“There was a meeting last night, as you may know, of Republicans and that room would have devolved into I think physical attacks on one another if people stayed in there for a long period of time,” said Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, a McCarthy ally. “People are mad … It is justified for them to be frustrated by what happened yesterday.”\\n\\nRead more about the in-fighting within the House GOP',\n",

       "    'text': 'The House is set to vote soon on whether to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, where lawmakers could take the rare step of impeaching a Cabinet official for the first time in nearly 150 years. Only one Cabinet official has previously been impeached in American history: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876.\\n\\nHere are key things to know about the upcoming vote:\\n\\nWhat Republicans are saying: House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar. The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.\\n\\nTight margin: But Republicans can only lose three votes in their razor-thin majority if all lawmakers are present, and a handful of lawmakers have not indicated how they plan to vote. GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado announced in an op-ed that he would not vote to impeach Mayorkas. GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California wrote on X on Tuesday he also will vote against impeaching the DHS secretary. House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee, who has led the impeachment effort, has been meeting with some of the remaining GOP holdouts in the lead up to the vote, according to GOP sources.\\n\\nWhat happens after the vote: Even if Mayorkas is impeached in the House, it is highly unlikely that he will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond if Mayorkas is impeached: Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.\\n\\nWhat Mayorkas is saying: Mayorkas – whom the department said is meeting with staff in Mountain View, California, on Tuesday, to discuss cybersecurity and artificial intelligence – sent a letter to House Republicans to defend his record in public service. “My reverence for law enforcement was instilled in me by my parents, who brought me to this country to escape the Communist takeover of Cuba and allow me the freedoms and opportunity that our democracy provides,” Mayorkas said. The Department of Homeland Security has also blasted House Republicans over its upcoming committee vote, calling it a “farce” and “distraction from other vital national security priorities.”\\n\\nThe Senate is considering a border deal: While Republicans in the House argue that the remedy for fixing the crisis at the southern border is to impeach Mayorkas and pressure President Joe Biden to take more executive action, their counterparts in the Senate have worked with their Democratic colleagues to unveil a border deal that would make long-anticipated changes to immigration law. But House Speaker Mike Johnson declared the Senate deal “dead on arrival” in the House after the text was released Sunday evening.\\n\\nRead more about the upcoming vote here.',\n",

Matt Rourke/AP\\n\\nDonald Trump’s New Hampshire triumph puts him on a GOP primary tier few, if any, Republicans have reached. Unofficial returns at time of publication have the former president at about 55% of the vote.\\n\\nHe’s only the second nonincumbent Republican to win a majority of the GOP primary vote in New Hampshire in the modern era. The only other was Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Trump’s 55% surpasses Reagan’s 50.2%. He is also just the second nonincumbent Republican to win the New Hampshire primary twice in the modern era. The other Republican was John McCain.\\n\\nThe fact that Trump was able to win both Iowa and New Hampshire is quite unusual. No other nonincumbent Republican has ever done it. Mitt Romney in 2012 came the closest (winning New Hampshire but losing Iowa by 24 votes) – and he took less than 40% in New Hampshire and under 25% of the vote in Iowa.\\n\\nTrump’s ability to win Iowa and New Hampshire with such ease tells you how strong his candidacy is among Republicans. He appeals to different parts of the party, as evidenced by the fact that he succeeded in two very different contests in two fairly different states:\\n\\nIowa is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists, dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. Few non-Republicans participate.\\n\\nis a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists, dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. Few non-Republicans participate. New Hampshire sees a relatively high turnout primary that openly invites registered independents (or undeclared voters). The Granite State voters are more moderate, far less religious and wealthier than Iowa's.\\n\\nPut another way, New Hampshire should have been a far worse state for Trump. His biggest backers look a lot more like the Iowa electorate than New Hampshire voters: conservatives, religious Republicans and Republicans of more modest financial means.\\n\\nBut none of that stopped Trump from pulling in the largest share of the vote for an non-incumbent in New Hampshire GOP primary history. It seems quite plausible at this point that Trump may pull off the ultimate historic GOP primary win: becoming the first non-incumbent Republican to go undefeated in all 50 states during the primary season.\",\n",

Karamo had planned a rival convention, potentially complicating the process.\\n\\nCNN previously reported that under Karamo’s leadership, the Michigan GOP suffered from internal strife and lackluster finances. A CNN investigation published in late 2023 found the party’s financial problems had become so bad that an internal report revealed the state party had a net income of just $71,000 over a nine-month period that ended with it $600,000 in debt.',\n",

Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.\\n\\nThe former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus.

Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.\\n\\nTrump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.\",\n",

Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”\\n\\nRaskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.\\n\\n“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.\",\n",

Sam Wolfe/Reuters\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.\\n\\n“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”\\n\\nTrump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.\\n\\nTrump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.\\n\\nIf the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.\\n\\nIf the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.',\n",

But like many Arab Americans, she feels betrayed by his response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the rising civilian death toll. Biden would need to curtail US military aid to Israel and call for a permanent ceasefire before she could even consider supporting him in November, she said.\\n\\nAnd as for Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Michigan, she’s leading the charge to convince Democrats to vote “uncommitted.” Elabed is the effort’s campaign manager and the sister of Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman in Congress.\\n\\nThe Listen to Michigan campaign was launched less than three weeks ago by Elabed and other Arab American activists in the Wolverine State. It’s a last-minute effort to send a “clear, sharp message” to Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party to address the concerns of the coalition that helped him win in 2020, Elabed said.\\n\\nSince its launch, the effort has been endorsed by progressive groups such as Our Revolution and more than three dozen current and former state and local leaders, including Tlaib and former US Rep. Andy Levin. Volunteers have contacted more than 100,000 voters in the state, according to organizers.\\n\\nThe president’s reelection campaign has responded to the Listen to Michigan effort by emphasizing Biden’s domestic accomplishments, framing the general election as a binary choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump and stressing that the administration is listening to people’s concerns and open to future conversations.\\n\\nWhy this matters: If thousands of Michigan Democrats vote uncommitted Tuesday, it would be the clearest sign yet that Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza could cost him critical votes in November. Arab and Muslim Americans make up a substantial voting bloc in Michigan, a key battleground state.\\n\\nRead more about the campaign for the \"uncommitted\" vote.',\n",

The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.\\n\\nTuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.\\n\\nThis is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.\\n\\nNow, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind.

This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s when I was a young Senator.”\\n\\nThe president also sought to explain the circumstances surrounding his interviews with the special counsel’s team, saying they were five hours long over the course of two days right after Israel had been attacked on October 7.\\n\\n“I was so determined to give the Special Counsel what they needed that I went forward with five hours of in-person interviews over two days on October 8th and 9th of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked on October 7th and I was in the middle of handling an international crisis,” Biden said.\\n\\nBiden concluded the statement by saying, “I take these issues seriously and no one has ever questioned that.”\",\n",

News 12 Long Island\\n\\nDemocratic former Rep. Tom Suozzi and Republican Nassau County legislator Mazi Melesa Pilip squared off Thursday night in the first and only debate of their race to replace disgraced former Rep. George Santos — a heated affair that underscored the contest’s national stakes.\\n\\nSantos himself was largely an afterthought as issues such as immigration and abortion – which have roiled New York’s 3rd Congressional District along with the rest of the country – dominated the debate.\\n\\nThe pair, along with News 12 anchor Rich Barrabi and the town hall-style audience, steered clear of the Santos fiasco that gripped the district for the better part of last year.\\n\\nHere are the main takeaways:\\n\\nImmigration takes center stage: Pilip accused Suozzi of “opening the border” and demanded that he “own” the issue, pointing to his past criticism of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and support for sanctuary cities.\\n\\nSuozzi, a moderate Democrat and former member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, rejected the charge, accusing Pilip of misleading the public about his record – which included a bipartisan immigration reform attempt with former GOP Rep. Peter King – and deriding her as a big talker with no coherent plan to fix the problem.\\n\\nSuozzi touts his brand: Suozzi has held office on Long Island for most of the three decades since he was first elected mayor of Glen Cove, on Long Island’s North Shore, in 1993. During the debate, he frequently questioned Pilip’s qualifications and ability to make legislation move on Capitol Hill while also leaning on his well-honed brand to fend off a flurry of attacks from Pilip, who has sought to paint him as a leftist.\\n\\nPilip at times became frustrated, and at one point, during an exchange over abortion, took a step toward Suozzi’s lectern. The Democrat responded with a deep-cut New York political reference – joking that she was channeling former Senate candidate Rick Lazio, who infamously infringed on then-candidate Hillary Clinton’s turf during a 2000 campaign debate.\\n\\nQuestions about abortion: Another fiery exchange between the candidates came on the issue of abortion. Pilip accused Suozzi of lying about her stance and Suozzi pushed her to answer whether she’d vote to codify abortion rights protections.\\n\\nWhat about George?: Pilip, who had initially endorsed Santos and later called for his resignation, acknowledged that the Santos scandal was “frustrating” and said that the former congressman “lied to all of us.” She swore to the accuracy of her resume, while Suozzi insisted he’s an “open book” and has been “examined over and over again.”\\n\\nSuozzi, however, used the opportunity to criticize Pilip for not participating in more debates, as this was their first, arguing that debates provide voters a chance to “fully vet the candidates and understand what they stand for, clear as day.”\\n\\nRead more on the special election debate here.\",\n",

And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.\\n\\nIt was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.\\n\\nIn what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.\\n\\nThis all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.\\n\\n“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.\\n\\nRead the full analysis here.',\n",

(Doug Mills/Pool/Reuters)\\n\\nFormer White House counsel Pat Cipollone testified for eight hours in front of the House Jan. 6 Committee on Friday in a closed-door interview. Here are some key moments of his testimony played at the committee\\'s seventh hearing on Tuesday.\\n\\nHe did not think there was sufficient evidence of election fraud: In his testimony, Cipollone said he agreed with former Attorney General Bill Barr, who concluded there was insufficient evidence of election fraud. He recounted former chief of staff Mark Meadows saying in November 2020 that then-President Trump should have conceded, to which he said he agreed. Jason Miller, a former senior adviser to Trump, told the committee that Cipollone called John Eastman\\'s theory to overturn the election \"nutty.\" Cipollone did not refute this statement.\\n\\nHe was verbally attacked during the Dec. 18, 2020 meeting at the White House. Cipollone told the committee he walked into the Dec.18 meeting attended by Trump, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, none of which, he said, he was \"happy to see.\"\\n\\nThe meeting, which lasted six hours, was described as “unhinged” by former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson after hearing screaming coming from the West Wing. Ideas circulated about overturning the election including Flynn\\'s suggestion to invoke martial law and inspection of voting machines.\\n\\n“I don’t think any of these people were providing the President with good advice,” Cipollone told the committee.\\n\\nAfter asking where the evidence was for claims of voter fraud, Cipollone said that he and Meadows were verbally attacked for questioning where the evidence for Trump’s falsely claimed victory came from. Cipollone told the committee the group responded with “general disregard for wanting to back up claims with facts.”\\n\\nIn addition to floating claims of voter fraud and plots to overturn the election, Cipollone described his opposition to Trump’s suggestion of naming Powell as a special counsel to investigate voter fraud in the 2020 election. \"I was vehemently opposed — I didn\\'t think she should be appointed to anything,\" Cipollone told the committee during his closed-door interview, according to a video clip from that meeting played Tuesday.\\n\\nHe thought it was a “terrible idea” for the President to follow a plan to seize election machines: A proposal for the federal government to seize election machines was \"a terrible idea,\" Cipollone told the committee.',\n",

Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell concluded his initial arguments before the Supreme Court justices after nearly an hour.\\n\\nHere are some of the key things that happened:\\n\\nPower of states: Several of the justices from both ideological sides pressed the Trump lawyer about stripping states of their ability to exclude candidates from power, including whether an “admitted insurrectionist” could be removed from the ballot.\\n\\nMitchell argued that it was the role of Congress to determine whether someone should be disqualified — so even if a person admits to being an insurrectionist, states have no basis to act. \"Even if the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist, Section 3 (of the 14th Amendment) still allows the candidate to run for office, and even win election for office, and then see whether Congress lifts that disability after the election,\" Mitchell said in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts.\\n\\nThe role of Congress: Mitchell argued that Colorado\\'s decision to remove Trump from the ballot was improper because, among other reasons, the state disqualified Trump before Congress explicitly gave it the power to do that.\\n\\nThe debate over the term \"officer\": The justices pressed Mitchell over whether the framers of the 14th Amendment believed the president is an “officer of” the United States, and therefore subject to the “insurrectionist ban” under Section 3. The argument is a central focus of the former president’s legal team, which believes that when the amendment’s framers wrote “officer,” they meant lower federal officials appointed by the president – not the president himself.\\n\\nThat discussion led to this particularly intense exchange:\\n\\n“For an insurrection, there needs to be an organized, concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence,” Mitchell said.\\n\\n“A chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection?” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked.\\n\\nMitchell responded: “This was a riot. It was not an insurrection.”\\n\\nWhat happens next for Trump\\'s legal team: Mitchell will have an opportunity to make brief rebuttal arguments to the justices at the end of the hearing, after lawyers for the Colorado voters and secretary of state finish presenting their case.',\n",

Evelyn Hockstein/Re\\n\\nThe Supreme Court appears poised to back former President Donald Trump and fend off a blockbuster challenge to his eligibility to appear on Colorado’s ballot as a presidential candidate in 2024, a move that would extract the justices from one of the most politically fraught appeals in the court’s history.\\n\\nIf Trump is pulled off the ballot in Colorado, Chief Justice John Roberts predicted that other states would eventually attempt to knock other candidates off the ballot. That, he signaled, would be inconsistent with the purpose and history of the 14th Amendment.\\n\\n“It’ll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,” Roberts said. “That’s a pretty daunting consequence.”\\n\\nAt issue is a provision in the 14th Amendment that bars certain public officials from serving in the government again if they took part in an insurrection. The six Republican and independent voters from Colorado who challenged Trump say his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol makes him ineligible under that “insurrection ban.”\\n\\nA majority of the conservative justices on the court posed tough questions to the lawyers representing the voters -- including whether the insurrection ban can be enforced without a law first passed by Congress – though it was unclear which route the court might take.\\n\\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed the attorneys about a 19th century decision from a lower court that suggested it was congress, not states, that must act first on enforcing an insurrection ban.\\n\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, on the other hand, stressed the idea that the ban only applies to serving in office – not necessarily running for office.\\n\\nThe amendment’s key provision, Section 3, says in part: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”',\n",

He testified in November in Denver District Court about Trump’s history of embracing of far-right extremists how those militant groups interpreted his incendiary rhetoric on the morning of January 6, immediately proceeding the violent storming of the US Capitol.\\n\\nPeter Simi testifies during a hearing for a lawsuit to keep former President Donald Trump off the Colorado state ballot in Denver in October 2023. Jack Dempsey/Pool via AP\\n\\nSimi’s testimony ended up being influential to the Colorado Supreme Court’s eventual decision to bar Trump from the ballot. But Alito pressed lawyer Jason Murray on whether other states might draw different conclusions, if they were to vet Trump’s actions on January 6. He suggested that other states might not even consider Simi as an expert.\\n\\nThe questioning was yet another example of how the justices appear to be skeptical of the effort to bar Trump from the ballot.\\n\\nHere’s CNN’s coverage from when Simi testified at the trial:\\n\\nTrump was often “using language with a wink and a nod,” Simi said, but members of these extremist groups consistently interpreted his comments as a “clarion call” toward “anger, resentment and mobilization.” This ramped up in summer 2020 as Trump began claiming he was being cheated in the presidential election, Simi said.\\n\\nEric Olson, an attorney for the Colorado challengers, played clips from Trump’s January 6 speech, where he urged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” so they could “save” the country (Though, at times, he also said they should do so peacefully.)\\n\\nRight-wing extremists understood those words as “a call to violence,” Simi testified.\\n\\n\"Within far-right extremist culture, fighting is meant to be taken literally … especially within the context as it’s laid out, that these threats are imminent, and that you’re going to lose your country. Then, fighting would be understood as requiring violent action.”\\n\\nThe relationship between Trump and far-right extremists is “unprecedented,” Simi said.\\n\\n“Far-right extremists really were galvanized by his candidacy starting in 2015,” Simi said. “And a relationship really emerged between Donald Trump and far-right extremists, with far-right extremists really seeing him as speaking their language, and really addressing many of their key grievances.',\n",

       "    'text': \"The 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” has already come up multiple times in today's Supreme Court oral arguments. It is a relic of the Civil War that hasn’t been touched in more than a century until the Donald Trump-fueled attack on the US Capitol.\\n\\nWhat does the 14th Amendment say? The 14th Amendment says Americans who take an oath to uphold the Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection” are disqualified from holding future public office.\\n\\nThe amendment’s key provision, Section 3, says in part: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”\\n\\nHowever, the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban. And there is an open legal debate over how some of the terms in the vague provision should be defined. For instance, the amendment doesn’t explain what level of political violence is tantamount to “insurrection.”\\n\\nThe US Supreme Court is reviewing a decision from the Colorado Supreme Court, which said in a landmark 4-3 ruling in December that the “insurrectionist ban” applies to Trump.\\n\\nTo reach that conclusion, the Colorado justices also ruled against Trump on several other key matters. They concluded that the ban applies to the presidency, even though the presidency isn’t explicitly mentioned in the provision. They concluded that courts have the power to enforce the ban, and don’t need to wait for authorization from Congress. They also concluded that the Denver-based trial was properly conducted under Colorado’s election laws that govern ballot access challenges.\",\n",

One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.\\n\\nMitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply...”\\n\\nKagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.\\n\\nAnother moment of laughter surrounded the order of specific questions. Kagan jumped in as Jackson pivoted to another point about the officer/office debate: “Could we — is that OK if we do this and then do that? Will there be an opportunity to do officer stuff or should we–?”\\n\\n“Absolutely. Absolutely,” Roberts said, diffusing the confusion, as people laughed.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'The South Carolina Republican presidential primary is usually the most important contest of the nominating season. The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.\\n\\nThis year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.\\n\\nTo put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.\\n\\n(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)\\n\\nAnother ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.\\n\\nKeep reading about what a Trump win in South Carolina could mean.',\n",

Janet Fries/Getty Images\\n\\nFeinstein was born in San Francisco in 1933 and graduated from Stanford University in 1955. After serving as a San Francisco County supervisor, Feinstein became the city’s mayor in 1978 in the wake of the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician from California to be elected to office.\\n\\nFeinstein rarely talked about the day when Moscone and Milk were shot but she opened up about the tragic events in a 2017 interview with CNN’s Dana Bash.\\n\\nFeinstein was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors then, and assassin Dan White had been a friend and colleague of hers.\\n\\n“The door to the office opened, and he came in, and I said, ‘Dan?’ ”\\n\\n“I heard the doors slam, I heard the shots, I smelled the cordite,” Feinstein recalled.\\n\\nIt was Feinstein who announced the double assassination to the public. She was later sworn in as the first female mayor of San Francisco.\\n\\nHer political career was marked by a series of historic firsts.\\n\\nBy that time she became mayor in 1978, she had already broken one glass ceiling, becoming the first female chair of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\\n\\nCalifornia’s first woman sent to the US Senate racked up many other firsts in Washington.

Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, Sen. Tim Scott and former Vice President Mike Pence participate in the FOX Business Republican Primary Debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on September 27, 2023 in Simi Valley, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\\n\\nThe second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.\\n\\nThe seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.\\n\\nTwo candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.\\n\\nHowever, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.\\n\\nHere are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:\\n\\nTrump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.\\n\\nA messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.\\n\\nCandidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”\\n\\nPalmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.\\n\\nAn uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.\\n\\nRead more debate takeaways.',\n",

       "    'text': 'CNN —\\n\\nSince the Supreme Court first convened in 1790, 116 justices have served on the bench. Of those, 108 have been White men.\\n\\nBut in recent decades the court has become more diverse. Over half of its appointed justices since 1990 have been women or minorities.\\n\\nThe two most recently appointed justices were women, and one a woman of color. Ketanji Brown Jackson, previously a federal appeals court judge, in 2022 became the first Black woman on the high court. She succeeded Stephen Breyer, who is White.\\n\\nAnd Amy Coney Barrett, also previously a federal appeals court judge, was chosen by Donald Trump to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020.\\n\\nHere’s how the demographics of the nation’s highest court have stacked up since its beginning.\\n\\nFour have been people of color\\n\\nOnly three African American justices, Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson have served on the court.\\n\\nThe first appointment – when Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Marshall – was in 1967. When Johnson announced the nomination, he said he thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it.\\n\\nThomas’s appointment happened decades later, in 1991 under George H.W. Bush.\\n\\nJackson became the court’s third Black justice in 2022 after being nominated by Joe Biden.\\n\\nSonia Sotomayor is the first and only Hispanic justice in history. (Some say Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was Portuguese, was the first Hispanic member, but he doesn’t qualify under current Census standards.) She was nominated by Barack Obama in 2009.\\n\\nNo justices so far have identified as Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander.\\n\\nAnd no women or people of color have served as chief justices of the nation’s highest court.\\n\\nSix have been women\\n\\nOf the 116 justices in history, 110 – or 94.8% – have been men. Until 1981, every Supreme Court justice was male. But Ronald Reagan promised he’d put a woman on the court, and during his first year in office he kept that promise by appointing Sandra Day O’Connor.\\n\\nBefore that, presidents had appointed women to lower courts. While Harry Truman, who was president from 1945-1953, thought about nominating a woman to the high court, sitting justices at the time said women “would inhibit their conference deliberations.”\\n\\nBill Clinton made the second appointment of a woman to the high court by nominating Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993.\\n\\nAnd Barack Obama appointed two women, the aforementioned Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, whom he appointed in 2010.\\n\\nSotomayor, Kagan, Barrett and Jackson all sit on the current court.\\n\\nEight have been Jewish\\n\\nAt its founding, the court was made up almost entirely of Protestant members, and a majority of the 116 justices throughout history have been Protestants.\\n\\nThe court today is more diverse. There are currently six Catholic justices, not including Neil Gorsuch — nominated by Trump in 2017 — who was raised Catholic but has more recently worshiped at an Episcopal church.\\n\\nThe US has never had a Jewish president, but eight Jewish justices have sat on the bench, including Kagan who currently sits on the bench.\\n\\nThere has never been a Muslim or Hindu justice on the Supreme Court.\\n\\nIvy League graduates dominate in recent decades\\n\\nWhile the educational law background of many Supreme Court justices’ has varied in past centuries, modern history has been less so. Of the 60 justices confirmed between 1902 and 2022, 15 graduated from Harvard, seven from Yale and four from Columbia law schools.\\n\\nOn today’s court, all but one — Barrett, who attended Notre Dame Law School — hail from Yale or Harvard. The four Yale graduates are Brett Kavanaugh, Sotomayor, Thomas and Samuel Alito, and the four Harvard graduates are Gorsuch, Kagan, Jackson and Chief Justice John Roberts.\\n\\nSince Oliver Wendell Holmes’ appointment in 1902, the Supreme Court has maintained at least one Harvard law graduate, and it has usually had multiple graduates.\\n\\nYale Law School did not have a graduate on the court until Potter Stewart’s confirmation in 1958.\\n\\nWhy diversity matters\\n\\nThe Supreme Court has ruled on a diverse set of topics and sees a wide array of cases.\\n\\nIt’s laid out decisions that affect many segments of the nation’s population, like whether schools should be segregated, whether women can get abortions and if public accommodations can refuse services based on religious beliefs.\\n\\nThe court has heard cases that none of its members can directly relate to. Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was decided by nine justices, none of whom have identified as gay. No past or present justices have publicly identified themselves as anything other than straight.\\n\\nIn 2016, Sotomayor said the court could use more diversity.\\n\\n“A different perspective can permit you to more fully understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand,” she said.\\n\\nThis is an updated version of a story that was first published in 2018 and updated in 2022.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Former President Donald Trump speaks at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday in Palm Beach, Florida. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\\n\\nThe Supreme Court on Monday ruled that former President Donald Trump could not be removed from the ballot in Colorado or any other state. It was a sweeping and historic ruling that brushed aside a lawsuit claiming that he disqualified himself from office because of his actions on January 6, 2021.\\n\\nIn a repudiation of the notion that Trump’s actions left him ineligible under the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban,” a unanimous court ruled that an individual state could not dump the former president from the ballot.\\n\\nHowever, the justices did not say if Trump was an insurrectionist and split on technicalities of how the ban could be enforced. A 5-4 majority said no state could dump a federal candidate off any ballot — but four justices asserted that the court should have limited its opinion.\\n\\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the ruling:\\n\\nTrump will appear on the ballot: There was no equivocation in the Supreme Court’s short opinion: States do not have the power to remove a federal candidate from the ballot under the Constitution’s “insurrectionist ban.” It is Congress, the court wrote, that can enforce the provision, not states. That means that the impact of the decision will sweep far wider than the controversy in Colorado.\\n\\nThere was no equivocation in the Supreme Court’s short opinion: States do not have the power to remove a federal candidate from the ballot under the Constitution’s “insurrectionist ban.” It is Congress, the court wrote, that can enforce the provision, not states. That means that the impact of the decision will sweep far wider than the controversy in Colorado. Court heads off 2025 showdown: The high court’s opinion also appeared to make it much harder for the insurrectionist ban to be enforced at the federal level. Four justices – Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – asserted that their colleagues went too far. The court’s opinion, the three liberal justices wrote in a concurrence, “shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement,” by requiring Congress to act to pass legislation first, something that’s highly unlikely. The move appeared to address a concern that a narrow ruling from the court could lead to a messy confrontation in Congress when the electoral votes are counted in 2025.\\n\\nThe high court’s opinion also appeared to make it much harder for the insurrectionist ban to be enforced at the federal level.

Avoiding insurrectionist debate: The Supreme Court’s opinion doesn’t directly address whether Trump’s actions on January 6 qualified as an “insurrection,\" skirting an issue that the courts in Colorado wrestled with. The unsigned opinion noted that lower courts in Colorado found Trump’s remarks before the attack on the US Capitol qualified as engaging in an insurrection within the meaning of the Constitution. But the court’s unsigned opinion didn’t return to that judgment direction.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion doesn’t directly address whether Trump’s actions on January 6 qualified as an “insurrection,\" skirting an issue that the courts in Colorado wrestled with.

Barrett\\'s concern with \"national temperature\": Barrett devoted more than half of her one-page concurrence to urging the public to look past the fact that four of the court’s members — herself included — disagreed with how broadly their colleagues decided the case. The conservative justice stressed that although she and the three liberal justices were at odds with their other colleagues, “this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency.”\\n\\nBarrett devoted more than half of her one-page concurrence to urging the public to look past the fact that four of the court’s members — herself included — disagreed with how broadly their colleagues decided the case.

They said that the majority opinion limited federal enforcement of the insurrection ban as well as state enforcement.

Jose Luis Magana/AP\\n\\nThe House speakership drama enters a new week under increased urgency as Israel declared war Sunday following unprecedented surprise attacks by Hamas.\\n\\nKevin McCarthy’s historic ouster as speaker leaves the House in uncharted legal territory regarding what it can do under acting Speaker Patrick McHenry. When lawmakers return to Washington, they will be under pressure to elect a new speaker swiftly amid the crisis in Israel, which has prompted some calls from within the Republican Party to speed up their timeline given the national security implications of keeping the role vacant.\\n\\nIn a briefing with House leadership Sunday night, Biden administration briefers from the State and Defense Departments told lawmakers they are moving as quickly as they can to deliver weapons and resources to Israel that were part of already existing contracts by accelerating them, three people familiar with the call told CNN. That could help ensure that the US can provide some items as soon as possible even as there are larger questions about how quickly Congress could act on a larger aid package.\\n\\nAdministration officials said they will look to the current $100 million in Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the rapid dispatch of weapons from existing stocks, to send more aid immediately, according to a person familiar with the discussion. The drawdown will likely need additional funds from Congress, the officials told lawmakers.\\n\\nAs the Biden administration looks to provide additional assistance to Israel, officials were unsure Saturday about what could be accomplished without a sitting speaker.

Win McNamee/Getty Images\\n\\nThe first down-ballot primaries of the year on Super Tuesday are likely to be even more consequential than the day’s presidential contests, which are unlikely to change the trajectory of the Democratic and Republican races.\\n\\nOn the ballot Tuesday are primaries for US Senate and governor, but it’s the primaries for the US House – where Republicans are defending a razor-thin majority – that are by far the most important for the balance of power in Washington.\\n\\nCentral to the fight for control of the chamber is California. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to flip the House, and in California alone, the party is targeting seven GOP-held seats. President Joe Biden would have won five of them in 2020 had the current district lines been in place, making these so-called crossover districts potential low-hanging fruit for a party looking to flip seats.\\n\\nOther states holding primaries for competitive House races Tuesday include North Carolina and Texas — and, to a lesser extent, Alabama, where redistricting has created a new district that’s much more favorable to Democrats. The four states, and Arkansas, also have primaries for seats seen as safe for either party, but the nominating contests could serve as key ideological tests.\\n\\nOnly Texas and California have Senate primaries Tuesday. Republicans need to pick up one or two seats in the fall – depending on who wins the White House – to win the majority. The Texas race for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz’s seat has taken on increased importance for Senate Democrats in what is otherwise a tough landscape for them.\\n\\nNorth Carolina is also hosting gubernatorial primaries Tuesday in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The open-seat contest is expected to draw fierce attention in this presidential battleground state, which former President Donald Trump narrowly carried in 2020 and which Biden is hoping to flip.\\n\\nGet up to speed on the key down-ballot primaries happening on Super Tuesday.',\n",

       "    'text': 'CNN’s Decision Desk projects the winners of dozens of elections each year, ensuring that the network reports the outcome of major contests as soon as it is statistically sound to do so, using a combination of exit or entrance poll results, vote returns and statistical modeling.\\n\\nHere’s a look at how CNN reports on the results of elections and how the CNN Decision Desk projects the winner.\\n\\nQ. Where does CNN get its election data and information?\\n\\nA. CNN is a member of the National Election Pool along with ABC News, CBS News and NBC News, working with Edison Research to collect vote returns from election officials and to conduct exit or entrance polls among voters who are casting ballots in major elections. Edison Research deploys a team of hundreds of interviewers and vote reporters across each state in those contests to conduct scientific surveys on voters’ opinions and to work with election officials to report election results quickly and accurately.\\n\\nCNN correspondents and anchors are also often on the scene of major contests, reporting on what they learn about the situation on the ground from election officials and voters themselves, and can provide pieces of information about the vote count that are essential to accurate projections.\\n\\nQ. How does CNN project races where one candidate holds a wide lead?\\n\\nA. In some cases, CNN’s Decision Desk can project a result based on exit or entrance poll results when one candidate holds a very wide lead. Exit and entrance polls are effective for this purpose for several reasons.\\n\\nFirst, a statistically sound sample can produce an accurate estimate of the outcome of the election within the poll’s margin of sampling error. In races with a wide margin, the difference between the two candidates vastly exceeds the error margin, giving the team confidence that the poll’s result will hold up when all the votes are counted.\\n\\nSecond, unlike pre-election polls, exit and entrance polls interview voters and caucusgoers at their polling places, eliminating the need for what pollsters call likely voter modeling, used to try to determine who will vote. Those conducting the poll can be sure that the people in these samples actually voted because they have physically shown up at the location where voting happens.\\n\\nAnd finally, in states with large absentee or early voting populations, the National Election Pool will supplement results from in-person exit or entrance polls on Election Day with surveys of absentee and early voters conducted online, by phone or in-person to make sure that the views of all voters are reflected in those surveys.\\n\\nQ. What about races with tighter margins?\\n\\nA. Elections that cannot be projected based on exit poll results could ultimately be projected based on several different ways of analyzing actual vote data.\\n\\nAs vote returns start to come in, the CNN Decision Desk will be looking for patterns in the data, how the results and turnout compare with past results for each location, and whether there are any anomalies in what’s been reported so far.\\n\\nAs counties and localities begin reporting results, the team’s statistical models will start to run, modeling outcomes based on different combinations of past vote, type of vote and geographic region. Consistent, strong models using those data and producing a high level of statistical confidence (99% certainty or more) could lead to a projection of the winner.\\n\\nAt the same time, Edison Research will attempt to collect the actual vote at each of the places where an exit poll was conducted, and since that sample of voting locations is a scientifically representative sample of all locations in a state, it is possible that those vote results could be enough to make for a statistically sound projection, even if there isn’t much county-level vote reported.\\n\\nAnd in the closest races, the CNN Decision Desk will be looking closely at estimates of how much vote is left to count – overall amount, what type it is and where it could come from. Determining whether there is enough remaining vote to shift the outcome will be the central question in deciding when it is possible to project a winner.',\n",

Dean Phillips, and Chuck Willing, a volunteer with the President Joe Biden write-in campaign, stand outside the polling place at The Barn at Bull Meadow during the New Hampshire presidential primary on January 23, in Concord, New Hampshire. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nUsually incumbent presidents win party primaries in a walk. But due to the Democratic Party's beef with the date of New Hampshire's primary, President Joe Biden isn't even appearing on the ballot in New Hampshire. The Democratic Party is also penalizing New Hampshire by taking away most of its delegates to the national convention.\\n\\nEven though he's boycotting the ballot, Biden's supporters are still hoping he wins and have organized a campaign to encourage Democratic primary voters to write his name in on the ballot.\\n\\nYou won't usually hear about write-in campaigns because they're usually just about impossible to win. It's the “triple lindy” of American politics.\\n\\nThe most recent, major write-in victory in a nationally important race happened in 2010, when Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, lost her party primary to Joe Miller, who mounted a challenge from the right wing. It was only the second successful Senate write-in campaign.\\n\\nThe late Sen. Strom Thurmond, a seriously controversial figure today, won the first general election write-in campaign back in 1954, riding a wave of frustration after the party anointed a candidate to fill the shoes of the primary winner who had died.\\n\\nSo is a write-in win impossible? No. Is it a frequent occurrence? It is not.\\n\\nBiden should have an easier time as a write-in candidate than either Murkowski or Thurmond. None of his competition has anywhere close to his name recognition. Plus, the people who show up for a Democratic primary in a year when their party is the incumbent are perhaps more politically attuned than the public at large.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'A look inside the House chamber in February. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP/File)\\n\\nThe 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.\\n\\nRep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.\\n\\nRepublicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.\\n\\nHere are key things to know about Tuesday’s vote:\\n\\nHow the day will unfold: Congress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, Jan. 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.\\n\\nMembers will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.\\n\\nThen the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.\\n\\nMembers can vote for anyone they want: There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.\\n\\nBoth parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead. McCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.\\n\\nIf neither wins a majority, a “floor fight” happens: Lawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected. This is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker. In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.\\n\\nIt doesn’t always require 218 votes: One important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.\\n\\nA version of this post appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

During his September visit to a nonunion shop amid the autoworker strike he lamented that Biden’s policies encouraging a move to electric vehicles was threatening their jobs.\\n\\nThe United Auto Workers endorsed Biden in January — Trump responded by calling the organization’s president Shawn Fain a “weapon of mass destruction.”\\n\\nTrump later met with Teamsters union leaders and members in Washington, DC, which angered one executive board member, who denounced Trump as “a known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.” Biden is expected to meet with the Teamsters next month.\\n\\nTrump’s share of the vote of union households fell from 48% in 2016 to 37% in 2020, according to CNN exit polls. The recent Fox News survey from Michigan found Biden leading Trump 53% to 41% among union households. Regaining that support could prove key to turning Michigan red again in 2024.',\n",

Gary Peters, the chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm who hails from Michigan, downplayed the progressive-led effort to vote “uncommitted” in Tuesday’s primary as a form of protest over President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\\n\\n“I'm not sure what we'll see tonight, we'll be watching that number. But it's certainly not unusual for people to vote uncommitted,” Peters told CNN, ticking off the number of uncommitted votes in previous cycles, including when Barack Obama was president and ran unopposed.\\n\\nAsked if he harbors any concerns about cracks in Biden’s coalition, Peters said: “No, no, I don't see that. But we'll continue to hold that together and continue to be strong. You know, if you look at former President Trump — he has an opponent taking 40% in primaries away from him. To me that's more significant.”\\n\\nHowever, others in the party have expressed concern about the organized “uncommitted” effort — led in part by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — even as they say they respect the views of voters and acknowledge it’s imperative for Biden to hear out their concerns in a key battleground state.\\n\\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, the other Michigan senator, said on CNN earlier today she thinks the campaign to urge voters to vote uncommitted is “certainly not helpful.”\\n\\nAnd one House Democrat told CNN there is “massive” frustration inside the party over the effort, worried it could backfire if it winds up helping get Trump elected. “The president is weak enough without hobbling him more with a concerted campaign against him,” the lawmaker told CNN.\",\n",

If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.\\n\\nWhen the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health.

He was under 90% of the primary vote in all those states and even came in with less than 80% in Connecticut. In the general election, all the New England states swung against Trump by about 2 to 4 times as much as the swing against him nationally compared with 2016.\\n\\nIn the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, we saw a somewhat similar phenomenon. President Barack Obama won about 90% of the vote nationally. He got below 60% of the primary vote in a line of states from Oklahoma to Arkansas to Kentucky to West Virginia.\\n\\nAll four were among the six states that swung the most toward the Republican candidate on the presidential level from 2004 to 2012.\\n\\nIt’s not exactly clear what a low level of support tonight for Biden would be. Still, he got over 95% of the vote in South Carolina and nearly 90% in Nevada. If he falls significantly short of those levels, it could be ominous.',\n",

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.\\n\\nHere’s what to watch for in Michigan:\\n\\nThe first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.\\n\\nA fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.\\n\\nTests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.\\n\\nRead more about what to look out for ahead of the Michigan presidential primaries.\",\n",

       "    'text': \"FBI agents arrest Jack Teixeira outside a residence in North Dighton, Massachusetts, on Thursday. (WCVB-TV/ABC/Reuters)\\n\\nJack Teixeira, 21, a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, was arrested by the FBI on Thursday in connection with the leaking of classified documents that have been posted online.\\n\\nJohn Miller, CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, discussed the circumstances surrounding the investigation and the dramatic arrest outside a residence in Massachusetts.\\n\\nHow did the arrest on Thursday happen?\\n\\nJohn Miller: What you saw was a very intensive investigation that has been going on since the day the Department of Defense referred this case to the Justice Department and the FBI.\\n\\nWhen the FBI made the call to move in today, it was not their preferred plan.\\n\\nThey have been closing in on Teixeira for a few days. The investigation is only five days old. His father’s home and his mom’s residence were both under surveillance today while agents worked with prosecutors to ensure the evidence they had was enough for prosecutors to approve they had probable cause to make an arrest. What they wanted to do was arrest him when he went to work at the military base where he was assigned. That would have been a controlled environment. But he didn’t go to work today.\\n\\nWhy didn't they want to arrest him at home?\\n\\nMiller: His social media posts indicated he owned a significant number of weapons including military-style assault weapons and, of course, he has received military training in those weapons. It’s also pretty clear from stories appearing in The New York Times and The Washington Post that Jack Teixeira knew it was a matter of time before he was identified and arrested. Not knowing his mental state, going up against a trained military person in a house with weapons was not an ideal scenario. The surveillance teams were literally watching New York Times reporters showing up at the door of the house. The suspect’s name was in the Times and that was out on social media — so the FBI made the decision to move in.\\n\\nWhat will the FBI be looking for in the house?\\n\\nMiller: They are going to want any computers, phones, hard drives, thumb drives, discs, gaming systems, printers, basically anything that could store data. They are going to look for notes, writings, papers, and documents. They are going to look for other things — the hunting magazine or the nail clippers, those things that were seen on the bed where it appears the pictures of documents were taken. If the bedspread matches the one that was in the background of some of the pictures of documents, they’ll take that too.\\n\\nSo how was the suspect caught?\\n\\nMiller: You had two fields of investigation here. One was on social media. How could you trace these documents back from Twitter to Discord to a private chatroom with a limited number of participants? That means serving Discord with orders to preserve these records so users can't delete them. That means getting subpoenas and search warrants for the contents of that chatroom. That takes some time because you have to show probable cause. The FBI was able to convince a reluctant witness who was a member of the chat group to cooperate and that helped move this process forward\\n\\nThe Washington Post was able to exploit that end of the case and talk to a member of the chat group who wouldn’t name the leader who posted the documents. The New York Times published his name before he was arrested, but that’s reporting, not evidence.\\n\\nThe DOD, FBI and OSI, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations explored those same paths, but they also did things reporters and online gamers and sleuths couldn’t do — they pulled logs. Who looked at those documents? Who, in a classified setting, read those reports and then sent them to a classified printer that logs every document it prints with a time stamp and the computer that sent the request. The computer records the chip of the ID card and the login of the user that pulled up the document to print it. They quickly narrowed a large number of possibilities to a very small number and zeroed in on this 21-year-old airman over the last 48 hours. One of the complicating factors was, reporters did too.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'A government shutdown was prevented after Congress passed a stopgap funding measure ahead of a critical midnight deadline in a whirlwind day on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden signed the bill late Saturday night.\\n\\nCatch up here:\\n\\nHow it came together: House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced the stopgap proposal Saturday morning, a move that came after weeks of infighting among House Republicans and a failed effort to pass a GOP stopgap bill in the chamber. The bill passed the House with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, and it then was sent to the Senate. The final vote was 88 to 9.\\n\\nThe bill will keep the government open through November 17 and includes natural disaster aid but not additional funding for Ukraine or border security.\\n\\nConcerns over Ukraine funding: The stopgap bill originally included funding for Ukraine to help Kyiv fight the full-scale invasion from Russia, but the funds were dropped after some conservatives raised objections during negotiations.\\n\\nDemocratic Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet briefly held up the vote on the bill after he objected over concerns about the lack of funding in it. Bipartisan members of Senate leadership released a joint statement committing to vote on further funding for Ukraine aid \"in the coming weeks.\"\\n\\nHouse Democratic leadership said in a statement that they expect McCarthy to bring a separate Ukraine aid bill to vote when the House returns.\\n\\n“We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,” Biden said in a statement.\\n\\nMcCarthy\\'s fate unknown: The decision by McCarthy to put a bill on the floor that would win support from Democrats could put his speakership at risk as hardline conservatives continue to threaten a vote to oust him from the top House leadership post.\\n\\nMcCarthy was defiant after the vote, daring his detractors to try to push him out as he argued he did what was needed to govern effectively.\\n\\n“If somebody wants to make a motion against me, bring it,” McCarthy told CNN’s Manu Raju at a news conference. “There has to be an adult in the room. I am going to govern with what’s best for this country.”\\n\\nHardliners are expected to force a vote to remove McCarthy as speaker, just “not yet,” according to a Republican lawmaker.\\n\\nFire alarm incident: New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman pulled a fire alarm in a House office building on Saturday morning shortly before the House was scheduled to vote on the funding bill, which he said was an accident.\\n\\n“I was trying to get to a door. I thought the alarm would open the door, and I pulled the fire alarm to open the door by accident,” he told reporters.\\n\\n“I was just trying to get to my vote, and the door that’s usually open wasn’t open, it was closed,” Bowman added.\\n\\nHouse Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil, who first revealed the incident, said \"an investigation into why it was pulled is underway.\"\\n\\nMcCarthy said the House ethics committee should look into it, while GOP Rep. Lisa McClain told CNN that she was circulating a resolution to censure Bowman.',\n",
