Go Nakamura/Reuters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nTrump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration \u2014 what he calls it \u201cmigrant crime\u201d \u2014 despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.\n\nThe former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley\u2019s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThese are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,\u201d Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.\n\nThe former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott\u2019s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state\u2019s legal challenge to the practice plays out.\n\nTrump\u2019s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden\u2019s perceived weakness on the border.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnn.com", "title": "CNN"}}, {"title": "Live updates: House passes short-term funding bill to avoid partial shutdown", "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-super-tease.jpg", "images": ["https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/1011a401-8005-4fc4-aac8-75b587b21304.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/75a002b4-fd2a-4814-94fd-d4c4133a9114.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/c7990080-f823-4e5e-afbd-954ddf2be89b.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/c6bf5fc4-ebe7-4e65-89e0-ee511fbe4e8f.JPG", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-super-tease.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/40833a77-3c82-47b7-93a8-c629a18c44ae.jpg"], "videos": [], "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/government-shutdown-deadline-02-29-24/index.html", "date": "2024-03-01", "short_description": "The latest on funding negotiations as shutdown deadline looms  CNN", "text": "House Republicans expressed frustration Thursday after a short-term bill to fund the government ahead of a Friday deadline passed the House with the help of Democrats after House Speaker Mike Johnson cut a deal with the White House and Senate on government funding.\n\nRep.

The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.\n\nThis is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.\n\nNow, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.\n\nRead more about why Michigan's primary is key.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnn.com", "title": "CNN"}}, {"title": "Supreme Court to decide Trump immunity claim", "top_image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231228230243-02-trump-file-122823.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b4f39436-ae2b-44b9-8c2c-ff19511dc7eb.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231228230243-02-trump-file-122823.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/q_auto", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/6840e0f3-bfea-4380-aa5b-7071eb279d3c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/858e3c99-ed4f-4af1-a193-60d261e9f482.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230422192329-biden-trump-split-042223.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/q_auto", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2cdeadc1-38d2-4968-b8e2-537cf58130a8.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ebe9eba5-574e-4988-bd0d-f98842917936.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230111171322-elise-hammond.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240227145233-rafah-022724.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/q_auto", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c79f8728-a2b9-41a2-bf2d-6d84fe9a168b.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8401a613-3b13-41ea-aedd-d1866f8030e6.JPG?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cf2e3bf3-16e6-429d-b201-7beadbb9cd2c.jpg?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill"], "videos": [], "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-legal-cases-court-02-28-24/index.html", "date": "2024-02-29", "short_description": "Supreme Court to decide Trump immunity claim  CNN", "text": "Former President Donald Trump attends a campaign event ahead of the Republican presidential primary election in North Charleston, South Carolina, on February 14.

So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.\n\nTrump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.\n\nIf the justices deny Trump\u2019s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.\n\nIf the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnn.com", "title": "CNN"}}, {"title": "Live updates: Hunter Biden sits in on closed-door deposition with House Oversight and Judiciary committee", "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240110110638-04-hunter-biden-capitol-hill-01-10-2024-super-tease.jpg", "images": ["https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/e5088872-d50f-41fb-95ca-0268651e3c76.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/be4a5eac-01ca-478a-91fe-b88561d9138c.JPG", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/340e63d9-3106-4719-8931-a4ecfdbe9ed8.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240110110638-04-hunter-biden-capitol-hill-01-10-2024-super-tease.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/b9f810a7-5e94-4bff-b62e-8e359d264baf.JPG", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/f3cdb473-8238-4f7d-a546-b96aa46cd3e9.JPG", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/22a74ef9-32e7-4b20-b0a9-e37e160da4d9.jpg"], "videos": [], "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/hunter-biden-deposition-02-28-24/index.html", "date": "2024-02-29", "short_description": "Hunter Biden's closed-door deposition with GOP-led House committees: Live updates  CNN", "text": "Democrats leaving Hunter Biden\u2019s deposition said the president\u2019s son raised the \u201cdouble standard\u201d of Republicans investigating his business dealings but turning a blind eye to members of the Trump family like Jared Kushner, whose company received a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia after leaving the Trump White House.\n\n\u201cI think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.

CNN", "text": "Former President Donald Trump attends a primary election night party at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Columbia on Saturday. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nDonald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.\n\nThe race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans\u2019 delegates are winner-take-all \u2014 which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line \u2014 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination \u2014 could be in sight for Trump within weeks.\n\nTrump dominates the GOP establishment \u2014 again: In case it wasn\u2019t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley\u2019s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are \u2014 as we\u2019ve seen \u2014 actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.\n\nWhere does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she\u2019s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she\u2019ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.\n\nNikki Haley arrives to speaks to supporters after the South Carolina presidential primary on Saturday in Charleston. Chris Carlson/AP\n\nA big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley\u2019s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can\u2019t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There\u2019s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump \u2014 particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump\u2019s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn\u2019t showing up for Haley in the primary \u2014 at least not in enough force.\n\nTim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina\u2019s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott\u2019s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley \u2014 who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor \u2014 to get out of the race.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnn.com", "title": "CNN"}}, {"title": "Live updates: Biden and Trump will win Michigan primaries, CNN projects", "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230917171655-trump-biden-split-0917-super-tease.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/5c8710cd-0a08-4f53-ac53-8023f071171e.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230917171655-trump-biden-split-0917-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/60b9d2b0-1fee-42e2-a980-ebc0837aaa8d.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/ea1d2ca4-0516-436c-a22c-ba0f34fff802.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/f7d70238-a423-4763-adaf-7e34a2b800be.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/416d4844-90b1-4d2d-9d47-9525335c85ff.jpg"], "videos": [], "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/michigan-primary-02-27-24#h_0c269e4c412eb66af5eb542f3f0e7d3e", "date": "2024-02-28", "short_description": "Live updates: Michigan presidential primary election  CNN", "text": "President Joe Biden smiles as he meets with law enforcement officials at the White House on Wednesday, February, 28.

Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.\n\nEngoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years.

But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company\u2019s expense, the ruling said.\n\nThe judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty.

Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney\u2019s office sought to undermine Bradley\u2019s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.\n\nBradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a \u201cdisagreement,\u201d but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.\n\n\u201cThat is not correct,\u201d Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnn.com", "title": "CNN"}}, {"title": "Auto jobs aren\u2019t as dominant in Michigan as they once were", "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/7c8d2983-c379-4c89-bc8e-b62e8cc565e6.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/fc0070bb-f4a7-44d1-8aef-4103d1ab860b.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/7281ed84-4478-4b12-9db7-c8302417263c.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/7c8d2983-c379-4c89-bc8e-b62e8cc565e6.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/e39e9c2f-668b-4c05-b177-a5c1da774633.JPG", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/d4f4e2ea-4521-449d-ad79-5a3d3042dc89.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/3264073d-d35f-4fb4-810c-8b00cfc97530.jpg"], "videos": [], "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/michigan-primary-02-27-24/h_80d7e1d0f547c25fe02ee2ba63e0a2e0", "date": "2024-02-28", "short_description": "Live updates: Michigan presidential primary election  CNN", "text": "In this 2021 photo, a 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L goes through assembly at the Stellantis Detroit Assembly Complex-Mack in Detroit. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nFew states are as closely associated with a single industry as Michigan and autos, which is holding its Republican and Democratic primaries today. But auto jobs aren\u2019t as dominant in the state as they once were. Michigan has lost many of the automotive jobs it once had to other parts of the country.\n\nJobs in the state\u2019s auto plants, parts factories and corporate offices shrank by 35% since 1990, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And those jobs make up only 3.7% of the jobs in the state, roughly half what it was in 1990. Today, more than four times as many workers in Michigan have jobs at one of the state\u2019s hospitals than at an auto assembly plant.\n\nSome of the auto jobs disappeared because of automation. Some evaporated as auto plants moved to Mexico since the passage of NAFTA and as some auto manufacturing shifted to nonunion plants in Southern states.\n\nWith cars far more technologically complex today, many tech jobs in the state focus on serving the auto industry, along with traditional support industries like trucking and other suppliers that don\u2019t show up as auto parts makers.\n\nTake

Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.\n\nRead more about what to look out for ahead of the Michigan presidential primaries.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnn.com", "title": "CNN"}}, {"title": "3 Republicans voted against Mayorkas' impeachment", "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/d5f0a4fa-0c73-4255-930b-d7bb35085f04.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240227145233-rafah-022724-small-11.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240228174010-dle-government-shutdown-small-11.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/88d93c4a-81ef-496c-996e-ec09307ae105.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/abc34072-c0d0-41e5-8b76-fd1145d26921.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/e2ff91da-2ce7-4988-b5aa-a495394249f2.JPG", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/0560d505-6ed8-42b4-b71d-27720792a6fe.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/5cecfad1-e09e-4e99-8b94-3a5772dd10e7.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/52d818d7-5a2c-4a82-be16-e117691a5580.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230422112329-biden-trump-split-042223-small-1-1.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/d5f0a4fa-0c73-4255-930b-d7bb35085f04.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/e8460f75-1a4f-42df-a24c-e42985070ffd.jpg"], "videos": [], "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvbGl2ZS1uZXdzL21heW9ya2FzLWltcGVhY2htZW50LWhvdXNlLXZvdGUtMDItMTMtMjQvaF81MDA1MmEyOTlmNWZjM2EwODZhZTBiMDE2ZDE4N2UyMtIBXmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL3BvbGl0aWNzL2xpdmUtbmV3cy9tYXlvcmthcy1pbXBlYWNobWVudC1ob3VzZS12b3RlLTAyLTEzLTI0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en", "date": "2024-02-13", "short_description": "House impeaches Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas  CNN", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson announces the vote to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has passed.

He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.\n\nThe vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.\n\nThis comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.\n\nHouse Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.\n\nThe impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.\n\nWhat happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it\u2019s blatantly political.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vote:", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.cnn.com", "title": "CNN"}}, {"title": "Your guide to the special election happening in New York's 3rd Congressional District", "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/a8571092-f64a-4760-a635-3152083a6fc5.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/03/20/live-story-status_light.gif", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240229184715-gaza-destruction-jabalya-022224-small-11.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/7016319a-fd4d-4275-956f-ebff5b0c24df.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/a8571092-f64a-4760-a635-3152083a6fc5.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240223210059-donald-trump-february-23-2024-rock-hill-south-carolina-small-11.jpg", "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/d06479af-3427-4406-884f-88680d98a3c0.jpg"], "videos": [], "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/ny-special-election-santos-02-13-24/h_59ae4f38c61d76e470423a884e75650d", "date": "2024-02-14", "short_description": "Your guide to the special election happening in New York's 3rd Congressional District  CNN", "text": "A voter casts a ballot at a polling station inside Robert Finley Middle School in Glen Cove, New York, on Tuesday.

Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.\n\nThe contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.\n\nFirst results to look out for: Because this is the first election that will be held under a new law that allows all New Yorkers to vote by mail without an excuse, election officials in Nassau and Queens counties will count these ballots before polls close.
