Please enter a valid email address.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.\n\nTrump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.\n\n\"In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,\" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.\n\nOn Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a \"personal vendetta\" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, \"$464,576,230.62.\"\n\n\"+$114,553.04,\" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.\n\nTRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE\n\nAgain, on Feb. 25, James posted, \"+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.\"\n\nJames' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.\n\nEngoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants \u2013 his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives \u2013 were liable for \"persistent and repeated fraud,\" \"falsifying business records,\" \"issuing false financial statements,\" \"conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,\" \"insurance fraud,\" and \"conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\"\n\nThe former president\u2019s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state\u2019s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron\u2019s Feb. 16 verdict in James\u2019 lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump\u2019s cash reserves.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron \"committed errors of law and/or fact\" and whether he abused his discretion or \"acted in excess\" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.\n\nTRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR\n\nTrump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.\n\nThe Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump\u2019s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.\n\nThere was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\"We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York\u2019s legal system,\" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.\n\nTrump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.\n\nJames, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump said Engoron\u2019s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was \"election interference\" and \"weaponization against a political opponent.\" Trump said he was being punished for \"having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.\"\n\nFox News' Anders Hagstrom and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "Hunter Biden testifies he 'did not involve' his father in his businesses, calls impeachment inquiry 'baseless'", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1845517792.jpg", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Haley-Trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/03/340/340/Brooke-Singman.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/348/196/Supreme-Court.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/348/196/GettyImages-1938768468-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/1200/675/GettyImages-1845517792.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/mary_ellen_withrow.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/06/1200/675/AP23177027348831.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/12/1200/675/AP23347595861026.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1845517792.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/70cf428c-7ff0-490e-ab16-fe41905f347d/3d9dabd8-54a1-48b4-92e9-b560bc09caa5/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-testify-did-not-involve-father-businesses-saying-impeachment-inquiry-baseless", "date": "2024-02-28", "short_description": "Hunter Biden testifies he 'did not involve' his father in his businesses, calls impeachment inquiry 'baseless'  Fox News", "text": "Hunter Biden testified Wednesday that he \"did not involve\" his father in his businesses, while blasting House Republicans for having \"hunted\" him in their \"partisan political pursuit\" and impeachment inquiry into his father.\n\nHunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father \"because there isn't any,\" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.\n\nBIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES\n\n\"I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,\" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. \"Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist.

And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,\" he continued in his opening statement.\n\nThe first son said that for more than a year, the committees \"have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism \u2014 all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. \"\n\n\"You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn\u2019t any,\" he testified.\n\nThe first son said House Republicans \"have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by\" past witnesses.

His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,\" he testified. \"What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.\"\n\nHunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.\n\n\"Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,\" he said. \"Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.\"\n\nFLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE\n\nHe added: \"If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.\"\n\nThe first son said he hopes his testimony will \"put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.\"\n\n\"You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,\" he testified.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said \"there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,\" after his client's testimony.\n\n\"Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it\u2019s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,\" Lowell said, adding: \"Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.\"\n\nHunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden \"has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest\" in his business ventures.\n\nHouse Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.\n\nDays before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.\n\nAfter Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to \"now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.\"\n\nHouse Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.\n\n\"The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was \u2018the brand\u2019 his family sold to enrich the Bidens,\" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. \"Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes.

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nIndiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.\n\nA three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.\n\nThe bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.\n\nINDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS\n\nOn Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.\n\n\"As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,\" the statement read. \"We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.\"\n\nIndiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal\u2019s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,\" he wrote.\n\nOHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO\n\nThe ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.\n\nRepresentatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTwenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.\n\nThe bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "White House calls for sanctuary cities to cooperate with ICE, amid furor over illegal immigrant crimes", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/biden-ice.jpg", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/GCyZo6mW4AA_52-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/348/196/Biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/5bfead5e-2358-4fcb-9e28-0d0a57d7b2ab/9e4a1a13-a3c6-47c4-b2a0-0591ec470515/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/1200/675/GettyImages-1668424535.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/AP24059679895953.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/Just-Stop-Oil-compilation.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/biden-ice.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/hunter_biden_deposition_getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/340/340/IMG_4166.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-calls-for-sanctuary-cities-to-cooperate-with-ice-amid-furor-over-illegal-immigrant-crimes", "date": "2024-02-28", "short_description": "White House calls for sanctuary cities to cooperate with ICE amid furor over illegal immigrant crimes  Fox News", "text": "The White House is calling for \"sanctuary\" cities and jurisdictions across the U.S. to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in turning over criminal illegal immigrants for deportation, just as there is renewed scrutiny over such policies in the wake of several high-profile crimes committed by illegal immigrants who had previously been released by local law enforcement despite pleas from ICE.\n\n\"We welcome local law enforcement\u2019s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,\" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. \"When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.\"\n\n\"Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals \u2013 the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,\" they said.\n\nSanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers \u2013 which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.\n\nSALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY\n\nSeparately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.\n\nBiden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO\u2019s receiving migrants.\n\nNYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\n\"He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,\" a spokesperson said. \"He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.\"\n\nProponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.\n\nGEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT\n\nAs a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered \"no\" when asked if \"undocumented immigrants\" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.\n\nIn his first days in office, Biden\u2019s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are \"inherently more unsafe.\"\n\n\"It is a concern, and I\u2019m very baffled by it,\" he said.\n\nDHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.\n\n\"Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,\" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n\nMayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.\n\n\"But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,\" he said.\n\n\"And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.\n\n\"I don\u2019t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,\" Adams said on Tuesday.\n\nHe added, \"You don\u2019t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.\"\n\n\n\n", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "Legal experts say Jack Smith\u2019s runway to try Trump before 2024 election \u2018just got a lot shorter\u2019", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/Donald-Trump.jpg", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/348/196/AP22155840298932.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Protest-2024-02-16-135719.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Kamala-Harris-Orangeburg-S.C.-Feb.-2-2024.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/Donald-Trump.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/1200/675/Donald-Trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/12/1200/675/JACK-SMITH.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/32ea9a16-948e-4a06-b27b-2b6753ffbe35/49ca7fd9-fdf9-479b-a026-6b8b20e89995/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/3c8d5c28-Haley-Trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/1200/675/US-Supreme-Court.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/b8ac6668-3ba4-4615-a765-64a8cce0491d/19b7081b-ac0b-4f75-bb68-1ddbd8c9bb0e/1280x720/match/720/405/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/legal-experts-say-jack-smiths-runway-to-try-trump-before-2024-election-just-got-a-lot-shorter", "date": "2024-02-29", "short_description": "Legal experts say Jack Smith\u2019s runway to try Trump before 2024 election \u2018just got a lot shorter\u2019  Fox News", "text": "Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge. Please enter a valid email address.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump\u2019s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.\n\nWhile some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump\u2019s arguments, they say that the high court\u2019s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would \u2014 or should \u2014 approve going to trial just before the general election in November.\n\nJonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says \"the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.\"\n\n\"I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,\" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\nILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'\n\nSmith\u2019s \"primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,\" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, \"there might not be a trial.\"\n\nTurley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a \"host\" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level \u2014 even if the district court were as \"motivated\" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election \u2014 the earliest a trial could start is the fall.\n\nTurley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe Justice Manual states, \"Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.\n\n\"Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department\u2019s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.\"\n\nWhile the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.\n\n\"The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,\" Turley said.\n\nJohn Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump\u2019s trials to start before the general election.\n\n\n\n\"If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,\u2019 especially if it\u2019s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden\u2019s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,\" Shu said. \"It\u2019ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.\n\n\"The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.\"\n\n\"This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,\" Shu added.\n\nOn the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, \"Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.\"\n\nBut, Turley said, \"the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court\u2019s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with \u2014 the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.\"\n\nSUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE\n\n\"The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,\" Turley said.\n\n\"The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity.

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nThe Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.\n\nThe case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a \"bump stock\" device is a \"machine gun\" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires \"automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.\"\n\nAfter a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that \"bump stocks\" are machine guns.\n\nThe Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices \u2013 reversing earlier regulations \u2013 and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.\n\nGOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'\n\nMichael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several \"bump stocks\" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.\n\n\"It really goes back to\u2026 freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency\u2026 to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,\" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\nThe conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.\n\nBut the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.\n\nThe justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.\n\n\"I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,\" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.\"\n\nJustice Samuel Alito called that \"disturbing.\"\n\n\"These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,\" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.\"\n\nA bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.\n\nTEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE\n\nAs the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will \"bump\" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.\n\nBump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.\n\nThe carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada \u2013 where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks \u2013 prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.\n\nGUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'\n\nBefore that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.\n\nThe ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.\n\nThe focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.\n\nBoth sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.\n\nThe government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire \"automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\"\n\nLawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.\n\n\"The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,\" said Justice Elena Kagan. \"So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.\"\n\nAfter attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, \"Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?\"\n\nBut other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,\" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, \"but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?\"\n\nThe technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.\n\n\"This is totally confusing,\" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.\n\n\"Now I'm completely lost,\" added Sotomayor at one point.\n\nCargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.\n\n\"If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,\" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.\n\nSupporters of the ban say it saves lives.\n\n\"Fully automatic firearms \u2013 and conversion devices \u2013 are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,\" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. \"ATF\u2019s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.\"\n\nA ruling is due by early summer.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "Illinois judge removes Trump from state ballot, citing 'insurrectionist ban'", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1938768468-1.jpg", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/c8285a87-d920-46e7-8d5d-53f892b27b6a/5b042025-5cc1-496e-8fef-d61655585bc3/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/348/196/AP22155840298932.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Protest-2024-02-16-135719.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Kamala-Harris-Orangeburg-S.C.-Feb.-2-2024.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/1200/675/GettyImages-1938768468-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/GettyImages-2036614182.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1938768468-1.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/1200/675/GettyImages-1395977284.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/340/340/IMG_6323.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/james-biden-dc.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/illinois-judge-removes-former-president-donald-trump-from-state-ballot-because-of-insurrectionist-ban", "date": "2024-02-29", "short_description": "Illinois judge removes Trump from state ballot, citing 'insurrectionist ban'  Fox News", "text": "Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.\n\nMcConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.\n\n\"One of life\u2019s most underappreciated talents is to know when it\u2019s time to move on to life\u2019s next chapter,\" he said in his floor speech. \"So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.\"\n\nThe dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nMCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE \u2018BEST WAY FORWARD\u2019\n\nMcConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, \"I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].\"\n\nThough the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.\n\n\"As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.\"\n\nLooking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for \"the next generation\" to assume leadership in the Senate.\n\nTRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: \u2018I DON\u2019T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'\n\n\"There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,\" he said. \"I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.\"\n\nMcConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.\n\nHis speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted \"a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,\" McConnell said. \"I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.\"\n\nMcConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as \"Mitch O'Donnell\" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.\n\nREPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH\n\nIn the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nAs majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.\n\nIn 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority\u2019s effort to deny President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.\n\nThe move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.\n\nThough hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations \u2014 and too critical of Trump \u2014 in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.\n\nOn the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\n\nFlorida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.\n\nReacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.\n\nRAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT\n\n\"Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. \"He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell \"a true legend of the U.S. Senate\" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.\n\n\"He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,\" Tillis said. \"He leaves very big shoes to fill.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOthers were less kind.\n\n\"I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. \"But why wait so long \u2014 we need new leadership now.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Jamie Joseph, Liz Elkind, Julia Johnson and Michael Ruiz, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this report.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "Haley says US will have 'female president' \u2014 either herself or Kamala Harris", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/Nikki-Haley-Beaufort-SC-Feb.-21-2024-e1708697418885.jpg", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/Trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/12/348/196/GettyImages-1845420889.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Biden-Judd.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/missouri_legislature.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/Nikki-Haley-Beaufort-SC-Feb.-21-2024-e1708697418885.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/Kamala-Harris-Orangeburg-S.C.-Feb.-2-2024.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/iamanallypg23.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/Nikki-Haley-Beaufort-SC-Feb.-21-2024-e1708697418885.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/b3ab6f14-9839-4355-8e1b-d8c96c07a2ac/422aba73-38bc-44f0-9293-82cd9edf60fc/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haley-2024-female-president-either-herself-kamala-harris", "date": "2024-02-23", "short_description": "Haley says US will have 'female president' \u2014 either herself or Kamala Harris  Fox News", "text": "Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge.

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.\n\nAustin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.\n\nLawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.\n\nAustin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.\n\nFATHERS, UNCLE OF MARINES KILLED IN CALIFORNIA HELICOPTER CRASH SPEAK OUT: \u2018SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED\u2019\n\nMARINE KILLED IN CAMP PENDLETON TRAINING EXERCISE IDENTIFIED\n\nThe Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.\n\nThe review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was \"no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.\"\n\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin\u2019s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.\n\nDOJ SAYS MERRICK GARLAND TO TRANSFER POWER DURING UPCOMING BACK SURGERY AFTER BIDEN DEFENSE DEPT CONTROVERSY\n\nHicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin\u2019s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.\n\nAustin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February.

My book, \"The Manipulators: Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Big Tech's War on Conservatives,\" was a multi-year project on Big Tech\u2019s political biases that drew on inside sources, leaked documents and more.\n\nI was curious to see if Google's AI program could be trusted to accurately describe an investigative book about Google, but I wasn't prepared for just how misleading it would be.\n\nCHATGPT FALSELY ACCUSES JONATHAN TURLEY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, CONCOCTS FAKE WAPO STORY TO SUPPORT ALLEGATION\n\nGemini's description of my book included this sentence: \"The book has been criticized for lacking concrete evidence and relying on anecdotal information.\"\n\nUnsure what it was referencing \u2014 I thought I would have remembered such criticisms of my own book \u2013 I followed up: \"Who has criticized the book for lacking concrete evidence, as you say?\" What came next floored me.\n\nGemini spat out summaries of four negative reviews, ostensibly from the Washington Free Beacon, The New York Times, The New York Times Book Review and Wired, including quotes from each:\n\n\"Book review by Matthew Continetti in The Washington Free Beacon: This review criticizes the book for relying on \u2018anecdotal evidence\u2019 and \u2018cherry-picking examples\u2019 to support its claims.\n\nBook review by Emily Bazelon in The New York Times Book Review: This review notes that the book 'lacks a deep understanding of how these companies work' and relies on 'unproven accusations.'\n\nArticle by Emily Dreyfuss in Wired: This article explores the \u2018dearth of evidence\u2019 for the book's claims about Big Tech bias and highlights examples of cherry-picking.\n\nArticle by Ben Smith in The New York Times: This article discusses the book's lack of rigorous research and its reliance on 'unsubstantiated claims.'\"\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch. None of those reviews were real. Not one. And neither were any of the quotes.\n\nThe Free Beacon did publish a review of my book, but unlike Gemini\u2019s fake review, it was overwhelmingly positive, describing The Manipulators as an \"excellent\" and \"thoroughly-researched\" book that \"should leave any sensible reader, conservative or otherwise, outraged.\" (Not to mention that the Free Beacon review invented by Gemini was attributed to Matthew Continetti, whereas Charles Lehman wrote the real review.)\n\nI immediately asked Gemini for links to the reviews it cited \u2013 knowing they didn\u2019t exist \u2013 at which point the chatbot clammed up: \"I do not have enough information about that person to help with your request.

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nFormer law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.\n\nBradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.\n\nDefense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded \"absolutely\" in the text exchange.\n\nWhen confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter \"dang.\" But then he said he was \"speculating\" in those comments.\n\nFANI WILLIS\u2019 TESTIMONY WAS \u2018BELLIGERENT\u2019 AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS\n\nAttorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on \"lies about your friends.\"\n\n\"Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?\" Rice asked.\n\n\"I could have had, I don't know,\" Bradley responded.\n\nBradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.\n\nFULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR\n\nBradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an \"in-camera\" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.\n\nBradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.\n\nBradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis\u2019 relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade\u2019s lawyer during Wade's divorce.\n\nMcAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.\n\nLawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an \"improper\" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.\n\nEarlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to \u2014 that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.\n\nFloyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis\u2019 impropriety were first made in court filings.\n\nDuring their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.\n\nMichael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.\n\nThe crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.\n\nGEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE\n\nWillis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.\n\nThe defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade\u2019s employment in the DA\u2019s office.\n\nBoth Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former \"good friend\" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.\n\nYeartie said she had \"no doubt\" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.\n\nShe testified to observing Willis and Wade \"hugging\" and \"kissing\" and showing \"affection\" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a \"romantic\" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.\n\nWillis dismissed Yeartie\u2019s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.\n\nThe highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis\u2019 own \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 testimony, which was described by one expert as \"belligerent.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.\n\nMcAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it\u2019s \"clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "Rep.

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News", "text": "Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.\n\nIn New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.\n\nAlthough Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhen New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.\n\nThe Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.\n\nThat matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections \u2014 and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.\n\nANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT\n\nAs surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady\u2019s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.\n\nMenendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.\n\nTOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION\n\nStill, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.\n\nKim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.\n\n\"We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,\" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"The fact that we\u2019re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.\"\n\nThe competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats \u2014 the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren\u2019t on the ballot this year.\n\nThe seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.\n\nKim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.\n\n\"If the Democrats don\u2019t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that\u2019s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I\u2019ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,\" Kim said.\n\nTammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.\"\n\nShe added: \"Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.\"\n\nREPUBLICAN HOPES\n\nThe possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.\n\nRepublicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.\n\nGOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES\n\nShortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.\n\nMurphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send \"ticked off\" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.\n\nA number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.\n\n\"We\u2019ll come together,\" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. \"The threat from Republicans is too much.\"", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "Jeb Bush comes to Trump\u2019s defense after $355M fraud judgment: 'Damage could cascade'", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/trumpjeb.png", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/Letitia-James.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/trumpjeb2.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/AP24059679895953.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/hunter_biden_deposition_getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/Just-Stop-Oil-compilation.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/348/196/Biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/trumpjeb5.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/trumpjeb.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/trumpincourt.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/b80a03e6-343d-496f-aa15-354a924e6653/b192dd3e-5c1b-4976-b562-779d0a0dce8d/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/1200/675/GettyImages-1780454143.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jeb-bush-comes-trumps-defense-355m-fraud-judgment-damage-could-cascade", "date": "2024-02-26", "short_description": "Jeb Bush comes to Trump\u2019s defense after $355M fraud judgment: 'Damage could cascade'  Fox News", "text": "Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge.

The opinion piece also spoke out against how a Delaware judge recently rescinded tech billionaire Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation from Tesla.\n\nTRUMP BLASTS 'CLUBHOUSE POLITICIAN' JUDGE AFTER BEING FINED $350M, DEFENDS THE 'GREAT COMPANY' HE BUILT\n\nBush ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election, when the two exchanged repeated barbs, including personal jabs such as Trump claiming Bush is an \"embarrassment to his family.\" In 2018, Bush said Trump is \"Republican in basically name only\" and took another apparent stab at the then-president, saying after he bowed out of the primary that he returned home where his children \"actually love me.\"\n\nFollowing Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, the former Florida governor said Trump \"provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol today.\"\n\n\"He has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection,\" Bush said in a post at the time. \"Mr. President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy.\"\n\nTRUMP BACKS GEORGE P. BUSH, JEB'S SON, IN TEXAS POLITICAL RACE\n\nThe op-ed marks a defense of Bush's former 2016 rival, albeit not for Trump\u2019s political stances. Instead, Lonsdale and Bush are calling for a \"dispassionate\" legal system that will not throttle businesses and lead to a weakened economy.\n\n\"\u200b\u200bNew York and Delaware have played an outsize role in business in the U.S.\" the pair wrote. \"Many major companies are incorporated in Delaware owing to the state\u2019s body of corporate legal precedents; and a significant number of banks operate in New York, the world financial capital. The appellate courts in those states now have a chance to review these dangerous judicial rulings and try to stop further damage to the reputations of their respective judiciaries.\"\n\n\"If they don\u2019t, blue-state politicians may have the satisfaction of \u2018sticking it\u2019 to Messrs. Trump and Musk, but the loss to those states will be significant,\" they continued. \"The damage to the legal fabric of the country will be even worse. A dispassionate justice system is at the heart of American exceptionalism, and the country will be poorer if we lose it.\"\n\nTrump has since appealed the ruling and repeatedly argued that the presiding judge, Arthur Engoron, and New York Attorney General Letitia James were politically motivated in the case.\n\nFORMER TRUMP RIVAL JEB BUSH CALLS MANHATTAN GRAND JURY INDICTMENT 'VERY POLITICAL'\n\n\"A crooked New York judge working with the very corrupt attorney general of New York State, who ran on the basis of \u2018I will get trump\u2019 before knowing me \u2014 before even knowing anything about me \u2014 just ruled that I have to pay a fine of $355 million based on absolutely nothing,\" Trump told Fox News Digital after the fine was announced. \"No victims. No damages. Great financial statements, with full disclaimer clauses, only success.\"\n\nNEW YORK AG TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER TRUMP FRAUD RULING: 'JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED'\n\nThe op-ed noted that when James was on the campaign trail for the attorney general position, she ran on a campaign \"promise to target the man she called 'an illegitimate president.\u2019\"\n\n\"The unusual New York law Ms. James used to investigate and sue Mr. Trump didn\u2019t require her to prove that he had intended to defraud anyone, or even that anyone lost money. The Associated Press found that of the 12 cases brought under that law since its adoption in 1956 in which significant penalties were imposed, the case against Mr. Trump was the only instance without an alleged victim or financial loss,\" the pair wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump attorneys had asked Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an \"orderly post-judgement process,\" which was denied Thursday afternoon.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "7.2M illegals entered the US under Biden admin, an amount greater than population of 36 states", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/biden-migrant-crisis-quarters.jpg", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Kamala-Harris-Orangeburg-S.C.-Feb.-2-2024.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/01/340/340/Chris-Pandolfo-Headshot.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/348/196/AP22155840298932.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/16759a56-49c8-47ac-adef-821c5ddad367/1ef874ff-8fe4-4fe7-a452-917b90705e33/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/migrants-texas-razor-wire.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/james-biden-dc.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/Protest-2024-02-16-135719.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/migrants-cross-into-us.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/biden-migrant-crisis-quarters.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/GettyImages-1988734939.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/illegal-immigration-texas.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/illegal-immigrants-biden-admin-amount-greater-population-36-states", "date": "2024-02-20", "short_description": "7.2M illegals entered the US under Biden admin, an amount greater than population of 36 states  Fox News", "text": "Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge. Please enter a valid email address.\n\nNearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.\n\nThat figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters \u2014 a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.\n\nThe total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.\n\nThat is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nMIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER\n\nCompared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.\n\nWere the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known \"gotaways\" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.\n\nTaken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.\n\n\"This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,\" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S \u2018WARZONE\u2019\n\nRepublicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external \"push\" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.\n\nHowever, the president's critics say migrants face more of a \"pull\" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.\n\n\"The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings \u2014 through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,\" Ruark told Fox News Digital. \"In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.\"\n\nIra Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.\n\n\"They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,\" Mehlman said. \"Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.\"\n\nLARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS\n\nBiden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an \"emergency border authority\" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.\n\nBut conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.\n\nWhile the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having \"refused to comply with Federal immigration laws\" and violating the \"public trust.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.\n\nBiden said that \"history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.\"\n\nFox News' Bill Melugin, Adam Shaw and Jamie Joseph contributed to this report.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "Biden health summary released by White House, president called 'healthy, robust'", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/Biden.jpg", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/Biden.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/340/340/IMG_0731.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/hunter_biden_deposition_getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/1200/675/Biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/KJP-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/02/348/196/Biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/680b7562-d83b-40ef-b7c0-2960e8800b88/c3b343c4-fafb-42c4-b5d1-0a5cdbb96c08/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/Just-Stop-Oil-compilation.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-health-summary-released-white-house-president-called-healthy-robust", "date": "2024-02-28", "short_description": "Biden health summary released by White House, president called 'healthy, robust'  Fox News", "text": "Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge.

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nThe murder of a Georgia nursing student allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested in New York City is the \"direct result\" of recent New York City laws that severed ties between the NYPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Republican Councilman Joe Borelli argued.\n\n\"It is a direct result of the City Council passing legislation that limits cooperation. If those laws were not enacted, the Department of Corrections would have given ICE the opportunity to issue a detainer against Jose Ibarra,\" Borelli told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week.\n\nGeorgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 22, was discovered beaten to death earlier this month after going for a run on the University of Georgia\u2019s campus. The Augusta University student crossed paths with illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra, according to authorities, and died from blunt force trauma to the head.\n\nIbarra, a Venezuelan national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was granted border \"parole,\" which allows noncitizens to temporarily enter the country due to an emergency or humanitarian reason, authorities have said. Ibarra soon made his way up to New York City, where he was arrested in August and \"charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,\" according to ICE.\n\n7.2M ILLEGALS ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES\n\nThe NYPD, however, has said it does not have a record of Ibarra's arrest.\n\nTypically, when ICE learns an illegal immigrant is arrested on criminal charges, the agency will issue a detainer that requests the local police department hold the suspect until ICE can take over and begin deportation proceedings.\n\nIn Ibarra\u2019s case, ICE said he was released by the NYPD before a detainer could be issued.\n\nNew York City, however, is a \"sanctuary city\" with relatively recent laws passed by City Council severing many ties between the NYPD and ICE.\n\nLAKEN RILEY CASE: HECKLERS SHOUT DOWN ATHENS MAYOR AS HE DENIES SANCTUARY CITY, ANNOUNCES PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDS\n\n\"A woman is dead in Georgia because the New York City Council passed local laws barring the NYPD from cooperating with ICE, and as such the suspect was released without any notification to federal law enforcement,\" Borelli tweeted this week, accompanied by a list of laws that restricted local cooperation with the immigration agency.\n\nUnder a pair of 2014 laws, the local Department of Corrections and NYPD were restricted from complying with ICE detainers under certain conditions. The DOC, for example, is only allowed to comply with an ICE detainer if it is accompanied by a warrant from a federal judge and if the suspect has been convicted of a violent crime in the last five years.\n\nLAKEN RILEY MURDER IGNITES DEMANDS TO HIRE MORE CBP AGENTS, REDIRECT $15B DEMOCRAT IRS PAYDAY TO BORDER\n\n\"Our city is not served when New Yorkers with strong ties in the community are afraid to engage with law enforcement because they fear deportation. Today, we send another message to Washington that the time to act has come to provide relief to so many individuals who contribute to our nation\u2019s growth,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said when the two laws were enacted.\n\n\"I\u2019d like to thank Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the City Council for passing this legislation, which further establishes New York City as a leader in immigration reform.\"\n\nSimilar reforms continued under the de Blasio administration, including in 2017, when the City Council passed a bill prohibiting \"City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law.\"\n\n\"The de Blasio Administration today announced the issuance of citywide guidance and new NYPD protocols to clarify and institutionalize the City\u2019s policy that it will not voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities, and will only coordinate in limited circumstances, including where there is a public safety risk,\" a press release from the de Blasio administration stated of the law at the start of 2018.\n\nBorelli, who has served on City Council representing portions of Staten Island since 2015, argued \"it's interesting to see people trying to backtrack on the impact that these laws have on the cooperation between ICE and city law enforcement.\"\n\nGEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT\n\n\"But the proof is in the pudding,\" he said.\n\nThe New York Republican pointed to comments made by local politicians when the laws were passed, arguing that Democrats wanted to sever communication between local law enforcement and federal authorities when involving illegal immigrants.\n\n\"The day we start helping ICE is the day we lose the public trust, which is why this guidance and protocol is so critical,\" a former NYC council member said in 2018, when de Blasio announced the prohibition of city agencies partnering with the Department of Homeland Security when related to immigration laws.\n\nCurrent New York City Mayor Eric Adams also supported the measure in 2018, when he served as Brooklyn borough president.\n\nLAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING\n\n\"It is important for our police officers and City employees to have clear guidance and protocol on how to interact with federal immigration enforcement, especially considering the overaggressive behavior of ICE agents. Public safety for all of our residents must come first,\" Adams said, according to the de Blasio-era press release.\n\nFollowing Laken Riley\u2019s murder, Adams said this week that he supports altering city laws that would open the doors to New York City officials working with federal authorities on immigration matters involving violent suspects or repeat offenders.\n\n\"I want to go back to the standards of the previous mayors who I believe subscribed to my belief that people who are suspected of committing serious crimes in this city should be held accountable,\" Adams told reporters at City Hall Tuesday.\n\n\"We should not be allowing people who are repeatedly committing crimes to remain here, and we cannot collaborate with ICE in the process,\" the mayor added.\n\nAdams has repeatedly spoken out in support of keeping New York City as a sanctuary city, saying illegal immigrants in the Big Apple should not live in fear of receiving city services, such as attending a school, due to their immigration status.\n\nWhen asked about Borelli's comments and the laws passed by City Council under his administration, de Blasio told Fox News Digital in a statement that it's time for \"tougher border policies.\"\n\n\"I trust the NYPD, and they say they never encountered the accused individual. But it\u2019s sickening that a young, promising life was cut short. Any way you slice it, we need tougher border policies and comprehensive immigration reform,\" de Blasio said.\n\nThe former mayor also pointed Fox Digital to an opinion piece he wrote this month, in which he proposed accepting \"Republican demands for greater border security in exchange for full funding of a humane and functioning asylum process,\" along with \"spending billions to create the facilities necessary on the Mexican side of the border, including the concessions and incentives the Mexican government would require in order to accept this plan.\"\n\nBorelli argued the push by the City Council to sever ties with federal authorities back when de Blasio was in office evolved from Democrats in the city wanting to resist what they saw as a \"Trump agenda\" on immigration.\n\n\"This was a reaction by the de Blasio administration and the City Council to push back on what they saw as the Trump agenda. And as long as they were doing what they could to oppose Trump, they didn't care,\" he said.\n\nBorelli said the local legislation is now backfiring as New Yorkers and others question the laws\u2019 logic.\n\n\"It's completely backfired when people start to question, \u2018What is the logic of having people who are here illegally in the first place, and then commit crimes against New Yorkers and others?\u2019 There's limited rationale for keeping them here, even if you were a progressive who is sympathetic to people coming here in the first place,\" Borelli said.\n\nLaken Riley\u2019s murder has shocked many Americans and heightened outrage about the Biden administration\u2019s border policies. More than 7 million illegal immigrants have flooded the nation since President Biden took office in 2021, a figure larger than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News Digital analysis previously found.\n\nRiley was reportedly so badly beaten during the murder that her skull was disfigured, investigators reported in an affidavit.\n\n\"He\u2019s a sick puppy,\" Borelli told Fox Digital when asked about the brutal attack. \"[He] would not have withstood screening, we hope, if we had a proper system of vetting and deporting people.\"\n\nIbarra is in custody and was charged with the felonies of malice murder, murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and concealing the death of another, as well as the misdemeanor of physically hindering a 911 call, according to the affidavit filed Feb. 23.\n\nLAKEN RILEY MURDER: MEDIA OUTLETS FOCUS ON LONE JOGGERS, DOWNPLAY SUSPECTED KILLER\u2019S IMMIGRATION STATUS\n\nNew York State Senate Republicans on Wednesday announced the renaming of legislation that would allow local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE. The legislation will now be known as \"Laken's Law\" in memory of Riley.\n\n\"Because of New York law, because of New York sanctuary state laws, local law enforcement do not notify federal immigration officials when they take someone into custody, even if they're here \u2014 especially when they're here illegally,\" Republican New York state Sen. Robert Ortt said at a press conference Wednesday.\n\n\"So, Laken Riley's murderer, albeit an alleged murderer, was in custody, law enforcement custody, and he was released without notification to ICE, to federal authorities, because of policies and laws passed by Democrats here in New York State,\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOrtt argued that if legislation allowing law enforcement to work with ICE were in place back when Ibarra was arrested by the NYPD, Riley \"would be alive today.\"\n\n\"It's not an opinion. It's not what I think. I'm not split. It's a fact. If this was the law of the State of New York, she'd be alive today. Her family would have a daughter today,\" he said.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.foxnews.com", "title": "Fox News"}}, {"title": "Text messages show timeline of events to disqualify Fani Willis, Trump camp asserts", "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-2036328740.jpg", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/Ashleigh-Merchant.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/12/348/196/GettyImages-1845420889.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/missouri_legislature.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/cffb722a-0b42-410c-be68-7fd5a03e3811/9d7d2279-03e3-48de-9973-25478a08c762/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/GettyImages-2036328740-e1709226550666.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/iamanallypg23.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1200/675/Fani-Willis-Nathan-Wade.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-2036328740.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/bidenborder.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_POLITICS-532x120.png"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/text-messages-show-timeline-events-disqualify-fani-willis-trump-camp-asserts", "date": "2024-02-29", "short_description": "Text messages show timeline of events to disqualify Fani Willis, Trump camp asserts  Fox News", "text": "Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge.

He also derided Willis as \"arrogant,\" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.\n\n\"I am nervous,\" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 \u2014 just a day after filling the motion. \"This is huge.\"\n\nBradley responded, \"You are huge.

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nIt is almost too early to truly understand and divine where the votes might for someone to succeed retiring Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nThe reason? The universe and conditions under which Republican senators will vote next fall to pick their new leader haven\u2019t formed yet. Yes, take a look at the three Johns: Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), former Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). Even someone like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) could be in play. A source tells FOX is interested in the race.\n\nGOP WON\u2019T TAP MCCONNELL'S SUCCESSOR UNTIL NOVEMBER\n\nBut beyond that, we don\u2019t know much.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nWe have to first know who wins the presidential election. And if 2024 is anything like 2020, we might not definitively know until week or more after the election. A delay in figuring out the winner could delay the internal secret leadership election which Senate Republicans will take in mid to late November. But the winner of the presidential election will dictate who the GOP wants \u2013 especially if former President Trump prevails and has much to say about it.\n\nIronically, FOX is told that the antipathy between the former President and McConnell was not a major factor in the decision-making of the Kentucky Republican to step down.\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL SENDS 'SHOCKWAVES' THROUGH SENATE WITH SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nAnother factor: who has control of the Senate \u2013 and by how many seats. Keep in mind we didn\u2019t know until January 2021 as to which party would control the Senate in the last Congress.\n\nThis is why other figures may emerge. Especially dark horses.\n\nImage 1 of 2 next\n\nImage 2 of 2 prev\n\nAs I have written before, leadership elections in Congress are not \"partisan politics\" They are \"particle politics.\" The person who is propelled into leadership is not always the obvious choice: Think former House Speakers John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Or even current House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).\n\nWHY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS' IMPEACHMENT TRIAL MAY BE ON 'HIATUS'\n\nFOX is told that some Senate Republicans are tired of what one senior Senate GOP leadership source termed a \"weekly MAGA show\" by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), JD Vance (R-Ohio) and others at the weekly Senate Republican Conference meetings. So if former President Trump loses and if the GOP doesn\u2019t have control of the Senate, that could dictate who Republicans pick.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, if Republicans prevail with a substantial majority, look at Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) as a possibility. He leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP\u2019s campaign arm. Daines has made many of the right moves so far in GOP contests. If Republicans win the Senate by a good margin, some members (especially the new ones), might be willing to give Daines a look \u2013 if he\u2019s interested.\n\nThe same factor could undercut Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). It\u2019s not clear if Scott is interested. He ran unsuccessfully against McConnell in the fall of 2022.
