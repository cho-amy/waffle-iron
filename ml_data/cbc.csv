and scandal: How two rogue scientists at a secret lab triggered a national security calamity  CBC.ca,"A high-security lab. Ebola. A mysterious package. The Chinese military.

The release earlier this week of hundreds of documents related to the dismissal of two scientists — Dr. Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng — has pulled back the curtain on an explosive national security probe at the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab, part of the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (CSCHAH).

The investigation — and the fight to make information about the investigation public — took years.

How it started

According to Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) documents, the agency's National Security Management Division was advised in September 2018 that Qiu had been listed as the inventor on a Chinese patent that might have contained scientific information produced at the CSCHAH in Winnipeg — and that she shared that data without authority.

Speaking to investigators from Presidia Security Consulting, the outside firm hired by PHAC to conduct a fact-finding mission, Qiu, then head of vaccines and antivirals with the CSCHAH's zoonotic diseases and special pathogens division, said she didn't know her name was on the patent.

WATCH | Scientists fired from Winnipeg lab shared information with China, documents say Scientists fired from Winnipeg lab shared information with China, documents say Duration 2:18 Intelligence documents detail why Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng were fired from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg in 2021.

According to Presidia's March 2019 report, multiple interview subjects, including PHAC's chief science officer, told investigators that it was highly unlikely that a researcher's name would appear on a patent without their knowledge.

The patent dealt with a treatment for Ebola. Fellow employees at the National Microbiology Lab interviewed as part of PHAC's fact-finding mission said the patent likely used information the CSCHAH lab had collected while searching for molecules and compounds that could inhibit Ebola.

The National Security Management Division also began an investigation into allegations that Cheng also had breached security policies in relation to students under his supervision.

Their interviews pointed to some lax security practices at the National Microbiology Lab. For example, in May 2018 a package from China labelled ""kitchen utensils"" arrived at the lab addressed to Cheng. An X-ray showed it contained vials containing a substance that was later found to be mouse protein. Cheng told investigators he didn't know it was coming and it wasn't infectious.

Other interview subjects (their names are redacted in the documents) suggested visitors were allowed on the premises without escorts. One subject said she heard of an incident where individuals were trying to remove vials.

""[Restricted visitors], they run amok. They have a sense of entitlement,"" she said.

The initial PHAC fact-finding mission raised many more questions.

On July 5, 2019 Qiu and Cheng were told they were subjects of an administrative investigation and ordered to stay home. At that point, their access cards and computer accounts were deactivated.

By February 2020, PHAC had determined the couple violated multiple policies by, among other things, shipping antibodies outside of the lab without authorization — including to the China National Institute for Food and Drugs — and failing to monitor restricted visitors who were later accused of removing government property without permission.

What CSIS found

Alarmed by the findings, PHAC sent its administrative report to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), which reopened its security assessment of Qiu and Cheng. The intelligence agency is in charge of conducting assessments of government employees who have access to classified information and sensitive sites.

The documents show the service's initial assessment of the couple in April 2020 gave them the benefit of the doubt.

Cheng told CSIS he had ""no connection with foreign officials. I'm just a biologist.""

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service said Dr. Qiu provided Beijing ""with the Ebola genetic sequence, which opened a door of convenience for China."" (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)

Qiu told CSIS she was unaware of the proper policies and procedures that needed to be followed and was too busy to read PHAC emails. She said that while she grew up in China, she considered herself Canadian.

""The service does not have a reason to suggest that Ms. Qiu would willingly cooperate with a foreign power knowing that harm would come to Canada,"" said CSIS's spring 2020 assessment.

""We do assess, however, that because of certain features of character — such as an overriding faith in the good intentions of other scientists, and a clear desire to avoid rules or procedures that could slow her down — that Ms. Qiu is susceptible to influence by a foreign state that could result in information or materials leaving the laboratory that could harm national security or the health of individuals.""

But by June of 2020, CSIS felt differently — and was armed with evidence.

In a document drafted that month and released this week, CSIS wrote that Qiu was using the level 4 lab in Canada ""as a base to assist China to improve its capability to fight highly-pathogenic pathogens"" and ""achieved brilliant results.""

Qiu provided Beijing ""with the Ebola genetic sequence, which opened a door of convenience for China,"" CSIS wrote.

Pointing to applications recovered in the course of their investigation, CSIS said Qiu applied to China's Thousand Talents Program for the stated purpose of helping the People's Republic of China build up its infectious disease research.

Beijing's Thousand Talents Program was set up to ""boost China's national technological capabilities and may pose a serious threat to research institutions, including government research facilities, by incentivizing economic espionage and theft of intellectual property,"" said CSIS in its report.

Qiu was also listed as a co-author on a research paper along with individuals linked to the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, which CSIS described as the highest-level medical research institution in China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). The academy works on ""health service tasks"" for the army, said CSIS.

""These tasks include the development of military biotechnologies, biological counter-terrorism and the prevention and control of major diseases,"" CSIS wrote.

CSIS said Qiu told 'outright lies'

Qiu told her CSIS interviewers she didn't think her scientific research could be used by foreign entities for nefarious purposes.

When confronted with her ties to China ""Ms. Qiu continued to make blanket denials, feign ignorance or tell outright lies,"" said the June 2020 CSIS assessment.

In one instance, Qiu told investigators a 2018 trip to China was a personal vacation. But she was later confronted with evidence she had agreed to work for the Wuhan Institute of Virology for at least two months each year, with the aim of boosting China's ""biosecurity platform for new and potent infectious disease research,"" said CSIS.

According to an email uncovered by the service, Qiu discussed shipping the Ebola virus to the Wuhan institute, without authorization.

The intelligence service also said it believed Cheng was not truthful in his interviews and had worked with a restricted visitor at PHAC ""who is connected to the People's Liberation Army.""

""The service assesses that Ms. Qiu developed deep, cooperative relationships with a variety of People's Republic of China (PRC) institutions and has intentionally transferred scientific knowledge and materials to China in order to benefit the PRC Government, and herself, without regard for the implications to her employer or to Canada's interests,"" CSIS wrote.

Taking CSIS's findings into consideration, PHAC suspended the couple's security clearances — a condition of their employment — in August of 2020.

Both filed grievances, alleging discrimination, reputational damage and emotional toil. The grievances were dismissed.

Pointing to a mountain of evidence, PHAC concluded Qiu represented a threat to the organization.

""Dr. Qiu represents a very serious and credible danger to the government of Canada as a whole and in particular at facilities considered high-security due to the potential for theft of dangerous materials attractive to terrorist and foreign entities that conduct espionage to infiltrate and damage the economic security of Canada,"" said a November 2020 PHAC report.

""Dr. Qiu demonstrates dishonest behaviour and her actions bring into question her trustworthiness.""

PHAC also said Cheng had invited foreign scientists to work at the National Microbiology Lab for months without approval and could not be trusted.

The government ultimately decided to revoke Qiu and Cheng's secret security clearances. Their dismissals were announced in January 2021.

CBC has made multiple attempts to contact Qiu and Cheng.

The Chinese embassy in Ottawa has denied that China stole Canadian information.

""The allegation that China tried to steal the secrets of Canada is entirely groundless,"" said an embassy statement. ""We firmly oppose this.""

The fight for the documents

After opposition parties spent years demanding access to government documents about the case, the federal government released hundreds of redacted pages on Wednesday.

The government initially opposed releasing the bulk of the information, arguing that it would be detrimental to national security. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would instead share the documents with the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), which is made up of MPs who are appointed by the prime minister and hold national security clearances.

WATCH |Trudeau accuses Conservatives of weaponizing national security Asked about Winnipeg high-security lab, Trudeau accuses Conservatives of weaponizing national security Duration 3:37 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he has asked his national security adviser to look into what happened at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg and make recommendations. He then pivots to criticize Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, accusing him of spewing conspiracy theories.

In June 2021, opposition parties voted to declare the Liberal government in contempt of Parliament over its refusal to release the documents. The federal government then took the Speaker of the House of Commons to court to get a judge's confirmation that it has the legal authority to withhold documents requested by members of Parliament sitting on a Commons committee.

Later, a special committee of MPs was set up to review the redactions. While the committee acknowledged some information should remain blacked-out due to national security concerns, it concluded that other information was being censored to protect government agencies. A panel of former judges signed off on the final release.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Trudeau and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre traded shots over the case.

Poilievre accused Trudeau of allowing China to ""infiltrate"" Canada and covering it up by delaying the release of the documents.

WATCH | National Microbiology Lab researchers should not collaborate with China, Poilievre says National Microbiology Lab researchers should not collaborate with China, Poilievre says Duration 1:02 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says researchers at the Winnipeg-based lab should not be allowed to collaborate with China.

Later that day, Trudeau accused Poilievre of weaponizing national security.

""The quickness with which they're looking for partisan advantage is not just undermining Canadians' trust in the system, but interfering with the ability of Parliament to deal with this,"" he said.

Trudeau said he's asked his national security adviser to look into what happened at the lab and to make recommendations.

The RCMP says it's still investigating the matter.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

servant's company received more than $200M in government contracts since 2015  CBC.ca,"An IT firm run by a defence department employee has been awarded millions of dollars in government contracts since 2015.

Dalian Enterprise has come in for scrutiny recently over its involvement in the development of the ArriveCan app. The company had received $7.9 million for its work on the project as of last March, according to a recent report from Canada's auditor general .

The company has received more than $200 million in government contracts since 2015, according to a CBC News analysis of documents tabled in the House of Commons in January.

The documents were filed in response to an order paper question from Conservative MP Dan Muys. They list the contracts awarded to Dalian from each government department between November 2015 and November 2023.

Natural Resources Canada and the RCMP have had contracts with Dalian but they were not listed in the documents. CSIS and the Communications Security Establishment didn't disclose if they've had contracts with the company, citing national security concerns.

Dalian's president and founder, David Yeo, is also an employee of the Department of National Defence (DND). CTV first reported the news and the department confirmed it to CBC News.

""Due to the serious nature of the concerns raised, DND is launching an internal investigation into the matter. The individual has been suspended while this investigation is underway. We are in the process of suspending contracts with Dalian,"" a department spokesperson told CBC News in an email.

Public Services and Procurement Canada announced Friday afternoon it had suspended Dalian from working on existing federal contracts and bidding on new ones.

""PSPC has taken swift action to suspend the security status of Dalian Enterprises (Dalian) in response to information that recently came to light,"" a news release from the department said.

CBC News has reached out to Yeo and Dalian for comment but hadn't received a response at the time of publication.

Government suspends Dalian contracts

The House documents suggest that Dalian's contracts with DND since 2015 total $1.9 million.

Defence Minister Bill Blair said Thursday during question period that all government contracts with Dalian have been suspended.

""We have suspended all contracts with Dalian, we have suspended the employee and we have launched an investigation on how this person became an employee in the first place,"" he said.

DND would not say how long Yeo had been working for the department, but his LinkedIn page suggests he has been there since 1987.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said the government should refer the matter to the police.

""This individual should be immediately fired. And there should be an immediate police investigation of his conduct and that of the company with which he is associated,"" he told reporters during a press conference Thursday.

While the documents only include contracts after November 2015, the government's procurement website indicates that the company had received contracts — some worth up to $2 million — under the previous Conservative government as well.

Indigenous Services auditing Dalian contracting

Earlier this week, a government spokesperson told CBC News that Indigenous Services Canada began auditing Dalian's past work.

Dalian's website describes itself as ""Aboriginally owned, veteran operated."" In October, Yeo told a House committee studying ArriveCan that he is the great-grandson of Chief Robert Franklin of the Alderville First Nation in Ontario.

The government has pushed to ensure that a minimum of 5 per cent of federal contracts are awarded to Indigenous businesses.

But another IT firm, Botler AI, raised concerns about Dalian's contracting processes during a separate October committee hearing.

Botler's chief executive, Ritika Dutt, told MPs that she fears Dalian's procurement policies are ""another example of monetization and theft using the trauma of marginalized communities.""

Dutt claimed Dalian is used by other companies who want government business because they can ""go after Aboriginal contracts"" by bidding with Yeo's firm as a joint operation.

Yeo denied Dutt's claims, telling MPs that they ""don't ring true.""

But after reviewing some of the evidence tabled at the committee, Liberal MP Jenica Atwin said ""it's clear to me"" that Dalian ""appears to be the flow-through as an Indigenous-led organization.""

""It is deeply disturbing to me that it was used in such a manner,"" Atwin said.

When questioned about his firm's work on the ArriveCan app last year, Yeo struggled to tell MPs what exactly his company did on the file.

He conceded that his two-person firm usually subcontracts out the ""daily"" work on federal projects to other businesses.

Dalian bids for tenders set aside for Indigenous businesses, collects the government money and disperses funds to the relevant parties that do work on a particular project, he said.

Yeo ran as a candidate for the People's Party of Canada in the 2021 election. The party put out a statement Thursday denouncing Yeo's involvement with ArriveCan.

over massive Veterans Affairs accounting error to cost Ottawa almost $1 billion  CBC.ca,"An embarrassing multi-million-dollar accounting error that was covered up for years at Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) will end up costing taxpayers almost $1 billion, now that a Federal Court judge has signed off on a combined class-action settlement.

More than 272,000 former soldiers, sailors and aircrew — most of them elderly — were short-changed on pension and disability payments for almost eight years, starting in 2002.

VAC staff made the mistake by not factoring provincial tax credits for individuals into their calculations. The department discovered the error in 2010.

The oversight was fixed but officials decided at the time not to notify the affected veterans and not to offer reimbursement for the missed payments.

The affected veterans — who include some former members of the RCMP — sued and have now been awarded an additional $817 million on top of $165 million in compensation earmarked by the federal government.

The Liberal government chose to settle the case rather than fight it out in court. A settlement agreement struck last fall was approved by Federal Court Justice Catherine Kane on Jan. 17, 2024.

The settlement comes into effect in mid-March.

Former veterans ombudsman Guy Parent originally uncovered the accounting error in 2018.

A CBC News investigation the following year showed how VAC covered up and downplayed the error to the former Conservative government, which was at the time engaged in a massive deficit-cutting exercise. According to internal records, no one was held accountable for the decision to keep silent and shortchange veterans.

The Liberal government's compensation program began making payments in 2019 and early 2020, but to date only 48 per cent of the funds have been dispersed, according to VAC.

When the compensation program was announced six years ago, a substantial number of the affected veterans — 170,000, most of them from the Second World War and the Korean conflict — had passed away. Some of their survivors and other veterans joined the class action lawsuit, which eventually grew to encompass 330,000 military and RCMP veterans.

'It's about integrity,' veteran says

Dennis Manuge, who fought and won a separate landmark legal battle with the federal government over military disability, was one of the plaintiffs in the case.

The idea that VAC could hide the mistake without consequences was one of his biggest motivations for getting involved, he said.

""Nobody has been held accountable and that's extremely frustrating,"" he said.

""I think, just on a fundamental level, it's about the dishonest nature of how everything kind of unfolded … It's about doing the right thing. It's about integrity, honesty. And when somebody that operates in the highest offices and makes decisions with big budgets and big money, we want those people [to be] responsible and accountable.""

He said the federal government has shown no interest in finding out who was responsible, even with a massive settlement hanging over it.

Veterans Affairs Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor declined CBC's request for an interview.

CBC News reached to the current veterans ombud, retired colonel Nishika Jardine, who was not available to comment.

Manuge said there is some disagreement among the class-action plaintiffs and their lawyers about the settlement agreement. Lawyers for the veterans uncovered additional errors in the government's calculations, he said — mistakes that could affect future payments going forward.

fired from Winnipeg disease lab intentionally worked to benefit China: CSIS report  CBC.ca,"One of the scientists who was fired from Canada's top infectious disease laboratory ""intentionally"" shared scientific information with China — potentially putting people's health in jeopardy — says an assessment by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).

The intelligence assessment was released late Wednesday afternoon by the federal government, along with hundreds of other documents about the mysterious dismissal of Dr. Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng.

The scientists and their students worked in the Level 4 virology facility at the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab (NML), which is equipped to deal with the most serious and deadly human and animal diseases.

The couple were marched out of the facility in July 2019 and were stripped of their security clearances. Their dismissals were announced in January 2021, triggering concerns about Chinese espionage and leading to heated demands in Parliament for more information.

According to the documents, CSIS conducted multiple security screenings of the couple.

The documents show the service had a more rosy initial assessment of Qiu's motivation, noting in spring of 2020 that she could be ""susceptible ... based on the belief in the power of science to help humanity.""

But as the investigation went deeper, CSIS's concerns deepened. A few months later, CSIS wrote Qiu was using the level 4 lab in Canada ""as a base to assist China to improve its capability to fight highly-pathogenic pathogens"" and ""achieved brilliant results.""

Qiu provided Beijing ""with the Ebola genetic sequence, which opened a door of convenience for China,"" wrote CSIS.

CSIS accused Qiu of being associated with multiple ""talent programs"" administered and funded by various Chinese entities.

Those programs are set up to ""boost China's national technological capabilities and may pose a serious threat to research institutions, including government research facilities, by incentivizing economic espionage and theft of intellectual property,"" said CSIS in the report.

In early January 2021, the head of CSIS's security screening program issued a dire warning about Qiu's trustworthiness and her ""close and clandestine relationships with a variety of entities of the PRC, which is a known security threat to Canada.""

The service also called out her ""reckless judgement regarding decisions that could have impacted public safety and the interests of Canada.""

""The service assesses that Ms. Qiu developed deep, cooperative relationships with a variety of People's Republic of China (PRC) institutions and has intentionally transferred scientific knowledge and materials to China in order to benefit the PRC Government, and herself, without regard for the implications to her employer or to Canada's interests,"" CSIS wrote.

""Because of her extensive knowledge of the harmful effects of dangerous pathogens on human health, Ms. Qiu should have been aware of the possibility that her efforts to engage clandestinely with the PRC in these research areas could harm Canadian interests or international security.""

Qiu sat for interviews with CSIS. The spy agency said she ""repeatedly lied"" during those interviews when confronted about her association with China.

Reinstating Qiu could put Canadians' health in jeopardy: CSIS

The CSIS document said Qiu was ""reckless"" when it came to the proper scientific protocols on the transfer of pathogens ""and in working with institutions whose goals have potentially lethal military applications that are manifestly not in the interests of Canada or its citizens.""

The report also noted she let two employees of a PRC institution ""whose work is not aligned with Canadian interests"" into the National Microbiology Lab.

In an October 2020 letter, released as part of Wednesday's document dump, Qiu wrote to a security screening employee that it was only during her interviews that she learned words like ""NATO"", ""spy"" and ""espionage.""

""I certainly owed my success to Canada, the most peaceful and multicultural country in the world, and I really felt proud as a Canadian,"" she wrote.

""Thinking back, what happened in the past were purely due to the lacking of proper training, the misunderstanding and ignorance of the policies of [the Public Health Agency of Canada] that I should have spent more time to learn and ask. I sincerely hope you understand my situation.""

Qiu ""consistently asserted that she had very limited knowledge of these institutions' mandates, despite an abundance of evidence that she was actually working with or for them,"" said the report.

""The service therefore assesses that because of adverse features of character — dishonesty, reckless judgement and lack of respect for accepted rules and norms — Ms. Qiu has acted, may act and may be induced to act in a way that constitutes a threat to the security of Canada.""

The intelligence agency said that if Qiu were reinstated at the lab, or allowed to retain a security clearance to handle sensitive biological agents, ""Canada's national security and the health of individuals may be put into jeopardy.

Health Minister Mark Holland said China's influence on Canada's scientific community ""was not known to the extent it was today.""

""These were eminent scientists whose research and work was well known. They were leaders in their field, some of the brightest scientists that were known,"" he said.

WATCH | Scientists at Winnipeg lab shared research with China, documents show: Scientists fired from Winnipeg lab shared information with China, documents say Duration 2:18 Intelligence documents detail why Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng were fired from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg in 2021.

""I think there was a nascent understanding of the extent to which foreign actors in the most direct sense — China we're talking in this instance, in other instances Russia and other foreign entities, foreign governments — were attempting to influence Canada.""

Holland said there was ""lax adherence"" to security protocols in this case, which he called ""unacceptable.""

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called the case ""a massive national security failure by Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government.""

""He cannot be trusted to keep our people and our country safe,"" he said in a media statement.

The Public Health Agency of Canada said screening measures are strictly enforced at the National Microbiology Lab for all staff and external visitors.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

bringing back visa requirements for Mexican nationals to curb asylum seekers  CBC.ca,"While CBC Radio-Canada journalist Louis Blouin described Canada's new visa requirements for Mexican nationals as a 'half-measure' that does not go as far as the policies of Stephen Harper's government that were struck down by the reigning Liberals, Blouin says these measures could create a tense diplomatic situation with Mexico.

The federal government is reimposing some visa requirements on Mexican nationals visiting Canada, senior government sources tell Radio-Canada and CBC News.

The new rules will take effect on 11:30 p.m. ET on Thursday.

Quebec Premier François Legault has been calling on the federal government to do more to slow the influx of asylum seekers into his province. Last week, he said Ottawa should bring back the visa requirement for Mexican travellers.

""The possibility of entering Canada from Mexico without a visa certainly explains part of the influx of asylum seekers,"" the premier wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau .

More than 25,000 Mexicans applied for asylum in Canada last year, making Mexico the top source of asylum claims, according to statistics from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada . The number of backlogged claims from Mexico currently filed with the board sits at more than 28,000.

The U.S. government also has been asking Ottawa to bring back the visa requirement to curb a sharp increase in illegal crossings from Canada into the United States.

Mexicans currently don't need a visa to travel to Canada, but they do have to obtain visas to enter the U.S. American border officials say some Mexican nationals are using Canada's visa-free rule to fly into the country and then cross illegally into the United States.

The new visa requirement is expected to affect roughly 40 per cent of all Mexican travellers to Canada, a government source told Radio-Canada.

The Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper imposed a visa requirement on Mexico in 2009 to stem the flow of asylum claims. The Trudeau government relaxed it in 2016 .

WATCH | Canada's new Mexico visa policies threaten refugees' rights, advocate says: Canada's new Mexico visa policies threaten refugees' rights, advocate says Duration 1:23 Luisa Ortiz-Garza, an organizer with the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, says Canada is not living up to its obligations as a signatory to multiple refugee conventions by imposing new visa requirements for Mexican nationals. 'People fleeing persecution and [seeking] asylum should be able to come here and claim that protection,' says Ortiz-Garza, who lived in in Canada for more than a decade undocumented before getting her permanent residency.

The new rules won't amount to a complete return to the pre-2016 rules. Mexican nationals with certain types of U.S. visas and those coming to Canada on study or work permits won't have to obtain Canadian visas.

Mexican nationals who received valid visas under the previous system at any point within the last ten years won't have to reapply under the new requirements.

The new visas will apply for a ten-year period and will allow a traveller to enter Canada multiple times and stay for up to six months at a time. Customs officers will have discretionary power to limit the duration of the visa or the number of visits, one source said.

The government isn't expected to announce the new visa requirements until Thursday.

But on Wednesday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador accused Canada of attempting to act unilaterally on immigration measures.

""They are in negotiations to reach an agreement so that we can control migratory flows from Canada,"" he said in Spanish during a press conference.

""We have acted generously with them, with the government of Prime Minister Trudeau, but they were already on the verge of applying unilateral measures.""

López Obrador also said he may not attend the next North American Leaders summit — set to take place in Canada — if he feels Canada and the U.S. aren't treating his country fairly.

""If there's no respectful treatment, I won't go,"" he said.

A source told Radio-Canada that in an effort to ease tensions with the Mexican government over the visa requirements, Ottawa has agreed to expand the number of sectors in which Mexican nationals can work in Canada. Negotiations are ongoing, the source said.

Legault has said asylum seekers are putting heavy pressure on Quebec's social services and finances.

""Asylum seekers have trouble finding a place to live, which contributes to accentuating the housing crisis,"" the premier said in his letter to Trudeau. ""Many end up in homeless shelters, which are overflowing.""

He said organizations that help asylum seekers can't keep up with the demand. Legault said the children of asylum seekers are also straining the resources of schools already facing shortages of teachers and space.

Legault's letter said asylum seekers who are waiting for work permits receive financial assistance from Quebec. Last October, he said, roughly 43,200 asylum seekers received $33 million in aid from the province.

Quebec Immigration Minister Christine Fréchette welcomed the news but said Ottawa must still do more.

""It's an important step forward, but it won't solve everything. The number of asylum seekers accepted by Quebec is far too high and our services are beyond capacity,"" she told reporters Thursday in French.

""The federal government must distribute the asylum seekers across Canada. Quebec bears a disproportionate share of the responsibility for receiving them.""

One source told CBC News that domestic issues were the main motivation for the change in policy, but U.S. pressure also played a role. Many migrants were being transported by criminal cartels with the objective of getting them into the U.S., the source said.

U.S. officials have suggested that people who can't get into the U.S. lawfully have an incentive to travel to Canada to try entering illegally. Human smuggling networks are cashing in , moving people who are fleeing poverty and violence in Mexico and using Canada as a pitstop on the way to the U.S.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data shows a spike in migrants entering the U.S. from Canada after Trudeau lifted the visa requirement in December 2016. There were 1,169 apprehensions of Mexicans the year before the requirements were lifted; the number nearly doubled to 2,245 in 2018, a year after the requirements were lifted.

Last year, the CBP recorded 4,868 apprehensions. Nearly 2,000 Mexicans have been apprehended at the Canada-U.S. border in the first four months of this fiscal year.

Those numbers are a tiny fraction of the number of apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border — nearly 580,000 last year. But the rise in apprehensions at the Canada-U.S. border was enough for U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to raise the issue during his visit to Ottawa last spring .

""We talk about this issue and many issues that impact the migration of people,"" Mayorkas said in an interview with CBC News Network's Rosemary Barton Live at the time.

""I think that's a decision that the Canadian officials are going to make,"" Mayorkas told host Rosemary Barton when asked about the prospect of Ottawa reinstating the visa program.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

or later, every NATO country will have to meet defence spending target, says Polish PM  CBC.ca","All members of NATO will eventually have to fulfil the pledge to spend two per cent of their GDP on defence, Poland's prime minister said on Monday at the conclusion of a meeting in Warsaw with his Canadian counterpart.

While praising Canada as one of Poland's ""best allies,"" Donald Tusk delicately avoided criticizing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's refusal to publicly commit to the alliance benchmark — something all 31 NATO members agreed to at last summer's leaders' summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.

""I don't want to break the rules of hospitality, but I'm convinced that sooner or later [meeting the target] will take place in every NATO member country,"" said Tusk.

Canada has been under increasing public pressure from allies — such as the United States and the secretary general of NATO — to lay out a plan to meet the two per cent of GDP target. This could require the federal government to invest perhaps as much as $18 billion a year more on top of the roughly $28.9 billion that's already being appropriated.

Donald Trump, the former U.S. president and likely Republican nominee, has said he'd encourage Russia to ""do whatever the hell it wants"" to NATO countries that don't invest enough in their own defence.

WATCH | Trudeau reiterates Canada's commitment to NATO, modernization of NORAD: Trudeau reiterates Canada's commitment to NATO, modernization of NORAD Duration 1:26 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, appearing alongside Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, stressed Canada's commitment to NATO, saying 'we know there is more to do and we are doing it.'

Tusk said the issue is not about responding to Trump's threats, it's about meeting assurances allies have made among themselves.

""So, the simplest answer is that we all, with no exceptions, fulfil those requirements,"" Tusk said. ""It's not because some politician wants it or not. It's because it's our commitment, so we should do it.""

'We know there is more to do'

In a message mostly directed to Poland's European allies,Tusk also said it's important for NATO countries to exceed Russia's defence capacity.

At the moment, Poland leads the Western alliance in terms of defence investment. It is spending 3.9 per cent of its GDP on the military, a figure that outstrips the United States, which devotes roughly 3.5 per cent of its economic output toward defence.

Canada, on the other hand, sets aside 1.38 per cent.

The Washington Post, quoting leaked documents, reported last year that Trudeau had told NATO allies Canada would never meet the two per cent target.

Standing next to Tusk on Monday, Trudeau stuck with his well-worn statement that Canada is a strong supporter of NATO — it always shows up and has the seventh-largest defence budget in the alliance. But he avoided making a specific pledge of meeting the target, or even having a plan to do so.

""We know there is more to do and we are doing it,"" Trudeau said, while noting the Liberal government's recent string of equipment announcements, including the purchase of F-35 fighters from the U.S.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre recently said that if elected, his government would ""work towards"" the alliance benchmark, which is what former prime minister Stephen Harper's government also pledged in 2014, when allies originally crafted their response to Russia's invasion of Crimea.

The slow pace of procurement

One of the biggest obstacles to Canada meeting the NATO target is the glacial pace of defence procurement.

During the 2019 federal election, both the Liberals and the Conservatives pledged to reform the defence acquisition system.

WATCH | Is Canada a weak link in NATO?: Is Canada a weak link in NATO? Duration 5:55 Former U.S. president Donald Trump suggested he would encourage Russia to attack NATO countries that don’t meet their defence spending quota — something Canada has never done. CBC’s Murray Brewster and Katie Simpson break down why and the wider response to Trump’s comments.

The governing Liberals proposed to create a single government organization — Defence Procurement Canada — to ""ensure that Canada's biggest and most complex defence procurement projects are delivered on time and with greater transparency to Parliament.""

The Conservatives, on the other hand, pledged to ""de-politicize"" defence procurement and create a cabinet committee as well as a Defence Procurement Secretariat within the Privy Council Office ""to ensure that priority projects are progressing on time and budget.""

What it boils down to, a number of defence experts say, is the inability of successive governments to deliver equipment on time and spend the money Parliament allocates, which impacts where Canada ranks in NATO in terms of spending.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

claims Trudeau is covering up lapses at high-security lab, PM accuses rival of spewing conspiracies  CBC.ca","Facing questions about how scientists who were intentionally sharing information with China were cleared to work at a Winnipeg lab studying deadly diseases, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau deflected criticism to his chief political rival and accused the Conservative leader of weaponizing national security.

During a Thursday news conference in Thunder Bay, Ont., Trudeau was asked how scientists working on high-security viruses at the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab were able to collaborate with the People's Republic of China.

After a years-long fight for access, the federal government dumped hundreds of pages of documents about the dismissal of Dr. Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng. The two were marched out of the facility in July 2019 and were stripped of their security clearances. Their dismissals were announced in January 2021.

The documents show Canada's intelligence agency conducted multiple security screenings and determined Qiu ""intentionally"" shared scientific information with China, potentially putting people's health in jeopardy.

WATCH | Scientists fired from Winnipeg lab shared information with China, documents say Scientists fired from Winnipeg lab shared information with China, documents say Duration 2:18 Intelligence documents detail why Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng were fired from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg in 2021.

""Dr. Qiu represents a very serious and credible danger to the government of Canada as a whole and in particular at facilities considered high-security due to the potential for theft of dangerous materials attractive to terrorist and foreign entities that conduct espionage to infiltrate and damage the economic security of Canada,"" wrote the Public Health Agency of Canada in 2020.

The RCMP says it's still investigating the matter. Trudeau said he's also asked his national security adviser to look into what happened at the lab and to make recommendations.

""We know ... that increasingly countries like China and others are trying to either influence or get secrets out of our country and that's why we have to continue to be extraordinarily vigilant ... to keep our research institutions safe,"" said Trudeau.

WATCH | National Microbiology Lab researchers should not collaborate with China, Poilievre says National Microbiology Lab researchers should not collaborate with China, Poilievre says Duration 1:02 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says researchers at the Winnipeg-based lab should not be allowed to collaborate with China.

He then turned his attention to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who held a press conference earlier in the day alongside MPs James Bezan, the national defence critic, and Michael Chong, the party's foreign affairs critic.

During that news conference, Poilievre accused Trudeau of allowing China to ""infiltrate"" Canada and covering it up by delaying the release of the documents.

He repeated claims that China backed the re-election of a Liberal minority government in 2021. A public inquiry will resume next month to investigate the breadth of Chinese interference in Canada's past two federal elections.

Trudeau says Conservatives 'complete ghosts' on Ukraine

Trudeau accused Poilievre of not taking the issue seriously.

""Unfortunately, throughout this process we have seen the Conservative Party, specifically Pierre Poilievre, choosing to spew conspiracy theories and drum up political attacks, partisan attacks, on an issue that quite frankly should be bringing Canadians and parliamentarians together to try and solve this,"" he said.

""The quickness with which they're looking for partisan advantage is not just undermining Canadians' trust in the system, but interfering with the ability of Parliament to deal with this.""

WATCH | Trudeau accuses Conservatives of weaponizing national security Asked about Winnipeg high-security lab, Trudeau accuses Conservatives of weaponizing national security Duration 3:37 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he has asked his national security adviser to look into what happened at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg and make recommendations. He then pivots to criticize Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, accusing him of spewing conspiracy theories.

Trudeau called out Chong and Bezan as ""complete ghosts"" on the ongoing war in Ukraine, and on their caucus colleague Leslyn Lewis's petition to pull out of the United Nations.

""The choice to weaponize national security in a way that is rife with conspiracy theories and partisan attacks is a choice that I don't think is worthy of the kind of responsible leadership that Canadians deserve,"" he said.

Getting the documents released has taken years.

The government initially opposed releasing the bulk of the information, arguing that would be detrimental to national security. Trudeau instead said he would share the documents with the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), which is made up of MPs who are appointed by the prime minister and hold national security clearance.

In June 2021, opposition parties voted to declare the Liberal government in contempt of Parliament. The Liberal government then took the Speaker of the House of Commons to court to get a judge's confirmation that it has the legal authority to withhold documents requested by members of Parliament sitting on a Commons committee.

Later, a special committee of MPs was set up to review the redactions. While the committee acknowledged some information should remain blacked-out due to national security concerns, it felt other information was being censored to protect government agencies.

""The committee feels the majority of the PHAC material should be lifted. The information appears to be mostly about protecting the organization from embarrassment for failures in policy and implementation, not legitimate national security concerns, and its release is essential to hold the government to account,"" the MPs wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

says Mexico isn't threatening trade consequences over new visa rules  CBC.ca,"Immigration Minister Marc Miller says Mexico has not warned Canada that the trade relationship between the two countries will suffer as a result of Canada's decision to re-impose visa requirements on Mexican travellers.

""Mexico as a sovereign country is allowed to take the measures it wants to take,"" Miller said Thursday in Ottawa. ""That said, I have not had any indication that they will be reacting on their end.

""I did not have any indication when I spoke to the Mexican minister of foreign affairs there would be any trade repercussions.""

CBC news first reported Wednesday that the visa requirement is being restored for Mexican travellers. The new rules will take effect on 11:30 p.m. ET on Thursday.

Mexico said it sent two ""high-level missions"" to Canada in recent weeks to express its concern about the effect the policy change will have on 60 per cent of Mexicans travelling to Canada.

""Mexico regrets this decision and believes that there were other options available before putting this measure in place,"" said a statement from the office of Secretary of Foreign Relations Adriana Bárcena. ""Mexico reserves the right to act in reciprocity.""

Miller said he knows Mexico is unhappy with the decision but the government had to act after a flood of failed asylum claims from Mexican nationals overwhelmed the refugee system and put a strain on social programs.

The ""increase of illegitimate volumes and illegitimate claims that don't even have the prospect of succeeding does put a pressure on the system,"" he said. ""It puts a pressure on the social supports that these people get simply by being on Canadian soil, so it has ripple effects across the system.""

WATCH: Marc Miller explains why Ottawa is changing visa rules for Mexican nationals Marc Miller explains why Ottawa is changing visa rules for Mexican nationals Duration 2:06 Immigration minister says 'claims that don’t even have the prospect of succeeding' required his government to act.

Canada received more than 25,000 refugee claims from Mexican nationals last year, says the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada — a number Miller says represents 17 per cent of all refugee claims Canada received that year.

Of those claims, 2,894 were accepted, 2,424 were rejected, 560 were abandoned and 1,240 were withdrawn by the applicants. Going into 2024, Canada had a backlog of more than 28,000 Mexican asylum claims.

""Increased volume, low success rate — there's a problem that has nothing to do with the [Immigration and Refugee Board] and an independent judicial process,"" Miller said Thursday. ""The government then has a right and then a duty to take action.""

Ontario, Quebec, U.S. expressed concerns

Miller said his government made the decision partly in response to pressure from the United States, which raised concerns about Mexicans traveling visa-free to Canada and then crossing into the U.S.

""We have seen a number of claimants cross from the northern part of the border into the United States,"" he said. ""I won't exaggerate those flows but they are significant. They are nothing compared to what the U.S. is facing with respect to their southern border.""

The minister said he was also motivated to clamp down after the provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec told him they were concerned about the rise in asylum seekers in their provinces.

Last week, Quebec Premier François Legault wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking Ottawa to bring back the visa requirement for Mexican travellers.

""The possibility of entering Canada from Mexico without a visa certainly explains part of the influx of asylum seekers,"" the premier wrote.

The new rules facing Mexican travellers

As of 11:30 PM Thursday, Mexican citizens who hold valid U.S. non-immigrant visas or have held Canadian visas in the past 10 years, and are travelling to Canada by air, will be able to apply for electronic travel authorizations (ETA).

The ETA is a digital travel document that most visa-exempt travellers need in order to travel to or through Canada by air.

Mexican travellers who do not meet these conditions will have to apply for a visitor visa to enter Canada.

The federal government said most approved visa applicants will get multiple-entry visas, allowing them to visit Canada as many times as they want over a period of 10 years, or until their passport expires.

Mexican nationals who want to work or study in Canada will not be affected by the changes, nor will the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or the International Mobility Program, the government said in a media statement.

Mexicans with valid work or study permits who are outside Canada can still travel here by air with their existing ETAs, providing they're valid, and can continue to study or work in Canada based on the validity and conditions of their permits, the government said.

WATCH: Poilievre says Mexico visa changes should have come sooner Poilievre says Mexico visa changes should have come sooner Duration 1:10 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should never have removed the visa requirements for Mexican nationals introduced by Stephen Harper — and should have acted faster to restore them.

Miller said Canada is expanding its network of visa application centres in Mexico to meet the demand.

The Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper imposed a visa requirement on Mexico in 2009 to stem the flow of asylum claims. The Trudeau government relaxed it in 2016.

Speaking in Ottawa Thursday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Harper's visa regime ""all but eliminated"" false asylum claims from Mexico and the visa requirement ""never should have been lifted by Trudeau.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

musings about ground troops send Ukraine's allies running for cover  CBC.ca,"If it were any other time — and if the stakes weren't so high — the swift international slapdown that followed French President Emmanuel Macron's recent comments on Ukraine might have been funny.

On Monday, Macron refused to rule out sending ground troops to Ukraine. The words were barely out of his mouth before startled allies and leaders around the globe started to wind them back, pour cold water on them and even refute them outright.

The speed with which nations lined up to have a crack at Macron was jaw-dropping. It was left to France's defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, to reframe what his boss had said by referring to discussions among allies about sending soldiers to carry out demining and military training in Ukraine — well away from the front lines.

""It's not sending troops to wage war against Russia,"" Lecornu said.

As if that would please Moscow any better.

The idea of dispatching western troops to Ukraine in any capacity has been unthinkable since the onset of major hostilities two years ago. NATO has made it quite clear it means to avoid being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia.

Macron's comments were interesting in part because he wasn't talking about an alliance-wide initiative (which would require consensus among all 31 members) but rather an individual bilateral initiative of the sort that's used to help train and arm Ukraine's military.

Even so, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and even the United States swiftly disavowed his idea.

Canada's response was a little muddled by comparison. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland avoided directly refuting Macron's suggestion on Tuesday. It was left to a spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair to articulate the country's position.

""We will continue to provide Ukraine with comprehensive military assistance, but as a NATO member, Canada has no plans to deploy combat troops to Ukraine,"" said Diana Ebadi.

Both Freeland and Ebadi pointed to the security assurance package signed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last weekend. It includes a clause stating that where military training is concerned, Canadian troops would return ""to conduct associated activities in Ukraine when conditions permit.""

Ukraine has been trying to entice allies to resume troop training within its borders. It's been sending its recruits and soldiers to the United Kingdom and Poland, where the bulk of the instruction has taken place.

It is safe to say that, with Ukraine on the defensive and the Russian army building up for a late spring or early summer theater-wide offensive, ""conditions"" are not right for the Canadian government to take such a provocative step, even if that was truly France's intention.

The news along the front in eastern Ukraine is growing more concerning by the day, with Russia recently making confirmed advances near Kreminna, Bakhmut and Avdiivka, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.

Zelenskyy said this week that Moscow is preparing a new offensive that will start in late May or June. He said the Ukrainian military has a clear plan to counter that push.

Andrew Rasiulis, a former senior official at the Department of National Defence (DND) who once ran the department's Directorate of Nuclear and Arms Control Policy, said Macron's comments are a sign of ""deep concern"" among European leaders about what's coming.

""The war is not going well for the Ukrainians. That's a fact. And so, people are getting nervous,"" said Rasiulis, a fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.

He described Macron's remarks as nothing more than ""musings"" that seem to overlook the full consequences — because deploying forces ""essentially means going to war.""

The Kremlin, in response, was swift to warn that any deployment of western troops would lead to a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia.

""In this case, we need to talk not about probability, but about the inevitability (of conflict),"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

WATCH: NATO nations in Europe ramping up defence spending NATO countries in Europe ramping up defence spending — and stepping up military exercises Duration 2:06 Ivo Daalder, former U.S. permanent representative to NATO, says European members of the military alliance are ramping up military spending in the face of Russian aggression.

Matthew Schmidt, a national security and eastern European expert at the University of New Haven in Connecticut, said Macron's remarks could have been an attempt at a display of resolve for Russian President Vladimir Putin's benefit. If so, they appear to have backfired.

Schmidt said it's a remarkable about-face for a French president who, earlier in the war, pushed for negotiations and infamously insisted that Russia deserved security guarantees.

""The question I have is the timing,"" said Schmidt. ""Everybody else in Europe is saying maybe it's time to, you know, look at negotiations, at least by the end of this year. Nobody is really doubling down at this point.""

Politically, Schmidt said, it may be that Macron wants to establish France as the leader of the alliance's European side in light of wavering in the U.S. Congress.

""I think Macron saying what he did might be more in the interest of Macron than in the interest of France,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

asks Canada to reimpose visa requirements for Mexico to stem surge of crossings at northern border  CBC.ca,"The Biden administration has been asking Ottawa to consider reimposing visa requirements for Mexican nationals visiting Canada, CBC News has learned.

At issue is the sharp increase in illegal crossings from Canada into the United States: Mexicans don't need a visa to travel to Canada, while the U.S. requires a visa for Mexicans to enter. American border officials say some Mexican nationals are using Canada's visa-free rule to fly into the country and then cross south illegally into America.

The Conservative government under Stephen Harper created a visa requirement in 2009 for Mexicans to stem the flow of asylum claims from Mexico. The Trudeau government relaxed it in 2016.

In an interview with CBC News chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas — whose department oversees border security and the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws — says the Biden administration has asked Canada to consider putting back in place the visa requirements for Mexican nationals.

WATCH | U.S. head of homeland security discusses cross-border issues: Homeland Security head cites security, humanitarian obligations to fight human smuggling Duration 9:00 Rosemary Barton Live's Canadian exclusive with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas discusses cross-border activity such as guns, drugs and migration.

""We talk about this issue and many issues that impact the migration of people,"" said Mayorkas in an interview airing Sunday on Rosemary Barton Live. ""I think that's a decision that the Canadian officials are going to make.""

Mayorkas was in Ottawa for the 2023 Canada-United States Cross-Border Crime Forum, alongside Attorney General Merrick Garland, and their Canadian counterparts, Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino and Justice Minister David Lametti.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data show a spike in migrants entering the U.S. from Canada after Trudeau lifted the visa requirement in December 2016: there were 1,169 apprehensions of Mexicans the year before the requirements were lifted but the number nearly doubled to 2,245 in 2018, a year after the requirements were lifted.

More recently, there's been a spike in illegal crossings through Canada: U.S. CBP reported 1,999 Mexicans being stopped trying to enter the U.S. between ports of entry at the northern border in the first six months of this fiscal year, compared with 882 for all of last year.



(The number of border crossers apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents along the entire 8,800-kilometre-long Canada-U.S. border is tiny compared with those entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico: 738,780 Mexican nationals were apprehended along the U.S.-Mexican border last year.)

Ottawa says no plans to change visa-free status for Mexican visitors

Both publicly and privately, U.S. officials have suggested that people who can't get into the U.S. lawfully have an incentive to travel to Canada and try entering illegally. Human smuggling networks are cashing in, moving people who are fleeing poverty and violence in Mexico, and using Canada as a pitstop to the American dream.

A senior Canadian government source with knowledge of the discussions between Canada and the U.S. confirms Mayorkas has indeed brought up the issue of visa-free travel for Mexicans multiple times this year — including in meetings with Mendicino and Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship.

The official said this issue ""hasn't been the main focus of conversations by any means,"" but acknowledges ""we know this is a concern"" for the U.S. The official characterised the discussions by the Biden administration with the Canadian ministers by saying ""They want to put on our radar that this is something that they're monitoring.""

WATCH | What happened during Biden's visit to Canada: Highlights from President Biden’s visit to Canada Duration 7:55 Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., gives her thoughts on President Biden's visit to Canada, while CBC’s Rosemary Barton and Alex Panetta break down the big pledges that came out of it and what could change for both countries as a result.

Despite Washington's concerns, the Trudeau government says there are no plans for Canada to change the visa-free status for Mexican visitors.

""Canada works closely with both the United States and Mexico on shared challenges, including border security. In collaboration with these partners, Canada has been monitoring migration trends from Mexico and has no plans to reimpose the visa requirement at this time,"" a spokesperson for Fraser said in a statement.

'Hemispheric challenges require hemispheric solutions'

Meanwhile, the Biden administration last week announced plans to establish immigration processing centres throughout Latin America in an attempt to help slow down the number of migrants coming to the U.S. The first processing centres will open in Guatemala and Colombia, with others expected to follow. The centres are meant to allow people fleeing violence and poverty to apply to fly to the U.S. legally and settle in not just the United States but also Canada and Spain.

""Minister Fraser and I talked about the possibility of Canada being a destination country for individuals whom we have screened and processed through those regional processing centres, so we're looking at how we can accomplish that,"" Mayorkas told Barton.

During Joe Biden's first official visit to Canada as president in March, Canada agreed to allow 15,000 migrants from the Western Hemisphere to seek asylum on a humanitarian basis through legal channels over the next year.

Mayorkas says the goal of the new pathways is meant to offer an alternative and discourage people from making the dangerous journey to the southern U.S. border in the first place.

""I spoke with Minister Fraser about our work together in addressing the challenge of migration. It is not something specific to the southern border of the United States or the northern border of the United States,"" Mayorkas said.

""We're seeing an unprecedented level of migration around the world and in our region … The challenge of migration is a hemispheric one, and hemispheric challenges require hemispheric solutions.""

The new plan by Washington to stem border migration comes just two weeks before the ending of Title 42, the controversial Trump-era border policy that allows U.S. border officials to quickly expel migrants and asylum-seekers on public health grounds.

The COVID-19 health policy has been used more than two million times to allow U.S. authorities to expel people who crossed the border irregularly without offering them the opportunity to seek asylum. Human-rights groups have said that the measure violated international law.

When Title 42 ends on May 11, Mayorkas told Barton that the U.S. will ""bring new enforcement measures to bear.""

The administration plans to swiftly screen migrants seeking asylum at the border itself, quickly deport those deemed as not being qualified, and penalize people who cross illegally into the U.S. or illegally through another country on their way to the U.S. border. Those expelled would also be banned from re-entering the country for five years, unlike under Title 42 which didn't prevent asylum seekers from attempting re-entry.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

by war, Russia's army is rebuilding with surprising speed  CBC News","As the second anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine arrives, the Russian Army is showing a remarkable capacity to take extraordinary punishment and regenerate itself at a pace western military leaders and experts had not anticipated.

Only nine months ago, American intelligence officials were telling the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that it would take a decade — or more — for Moscow to recover from the staggering losses inflicted by Ukrainian defenders. The German Council on Foreign Relations refined that estimate last fall, warning that the window would be more like five to eight years.

""They are sparing no effort in their reconstitution,"" Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO's supreme allied commander, said last month after a meeting of the alliance's chiefs of defence staff.

""They are devoting an enormous fraction of their budget to the military over the coming years, next year specifically, and they are running their defence industrial base just as fast as they can right now.""

Other top military commanders also acknowledge the shift but qualify their assessment by saying that while Moscow is churning out quantity, it may not be achieving quality.

""The number of [Russian] forces that have been going into Ukraine has increased over the last two and a half years, but qualitatively it is going down in terms of the land domain — and that is both in their capabilities and in the personnel capabilities,"" said Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, the chair of NATO's military council.

""It has more people, but it's less trained than when they started the war in the land domain. They lost a lot of tanks, a lot of armoured vehicles, they've lost airplanes, they lost helicopters ... a lot of equipment.""

Last week, a senior U.S. Pentagon official estimated that as many as 315,000 Russian soldiers have died or been wounded since the full invasion on Feb. 24, 2022 — essentially the entire army with which Russia started the war.

The Kremlin has had to dig deep into its inventory to carry out its renewal.

""They're rebuilding, but most of the time it's older types [of armoured vehicles] they're rebuilding, or they're taking types out of capabilities or equipment out of stock, which is most of the time also older equipment,"" Bauer said.

That's likely cold comfort to the Ukrainians who were forced to withdraw from the strategic eastern town of Avdiivka last weekend after months of holding off Russian human wave attacks — attacks which, according to international media reports, have left the surrounding streets and fields littered with corpses.

The Kremlin's strategy is clear: use the country's enormous manpower advantage and deep well of Cold War military hardware to grind down the Ukrainians.

The quality of quantity

""They are most obviously going to reconstitute but it is hampered by the sanctions,"" Bauer said. ""It is hampered by money issues and it is just hampered by their ability to produce enough, especially the more modern equipment.

""But they're doing actually rather well in terms of their artillery production and their older tanks. So I think that is, of course, a concern, because in the end, sometimes quantity becomes a quality in itself.""

The London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) last week produced a study that provides the most comprehensive snapshot of where the Russian military has come from and where it's likely headed in the coming years.

""The Russian military began 2023 with a highly disorganized force in Ukraine comprising approximately 360,000 troops,"" military experts Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds wrote in the study, released on Feb. 13.

""By the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive in June 2023, this had risen to 410,000 troops and was becoming more organized. Over the summer of 2023, Russia established training regiments along the border and in the occupied territories and — following the mutiny of Wagner forces — endeavoured to standardize its units, breaking down the previous trend toward private armies.

""By the beginning of 2024, the Russian Operational Group of Forces in the occupied territories comprised 470,000 troops.""

Smaller attacks, steady losses

The RUSI report said that with no large-scale offensives underway, Russian units are conducting smaller tactical attacks that ""at minimum inflict steady losses on Ukraine and allow Russian forces to seize and hold positions.""

Russia's ministry of defence has said it wants to expand the military to 1.5 million personnel, a plan that has not been realized. RUSI's report says ""recruiters are currently achieving almost 85 per cent of their assigned targets for contracting troops to fight in Ukraine. The Kremlin therefore believes that it can sustain the current rate of attrition through 2025.""

In a separate analysis released recently, Franz-Stefan Gady of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said that Russia has several material advantages, notably in artillery.

""Russia will also continue regenerating combat power, recruiting more than 10,000 troops per month,"" Gady said.

Where Russia’s war with Ukraine stands after 2 years Duration 3:27 After two years of a battle between Russian force and Ukrainian determination, The National breaks down the state of the war.

Moscow recently announced it intends to spend six per cent of its gross domestic product on defence, a significant increase over 2023.

""Its apparent intent is to overwhelm Ukraine through defence-industrial mobilization and sustained regeneration of combat forces,"" Gady said.

But other experts note that Russia is getting significant outside help from its allies.

""As I look at Russian efforts over the past several months, there is a significant effort to reinvigorate the defence industrial base for a protracted war,"" said Seth Jones of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

""I think it's reasonable now to expect that Russians now have stockpiles that they would be able to fight for at least another year or two.""

Jones also pointed to declassified U.S. intelligence assessments that indicate China has ramped up military aid to both the Russian military and its intelligence services. China has supplied components for navigation equipment in M-17 military helicopters, jamming technology for military vehicles, parts for fighter jets and components for defence systems like the S-400 Surface-to-Air Missile System.

Iran has supported Moscow with Shahed 136s and the Mojaher 6 drones and plans to build a drone factory near the Russian town of Yelabuga. North Korea has provided artillery shells and munitions for Moscow's war in Ukraine.

""So I certainly think along those lines the Russians have the ability to continue to fight for quite some time,"" said Jones.

U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said that wider support for the Kremlin's war is alarming.

""Everybody else is investing — including the United States — in our future, and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is investing in death and destruction,"" Nuland said Thursday during an online forum hosted by CSIS.

""We should all be horrified that he is now getting drones made for him, not only in Iran but by Iranians in Russia, that he's cut some deal with [Kim Jong Un] in [North Korea]. And who knows what kind of technology Russia is trading to get 155 [millimetre artillery] ammunition that it's using on the battlefield. So this is massively destabilizing.""

Maria Snegovaya, a postdoctoral fellow at Washington's Georgetown University and a resident expert at CSIS, said there are a few signs of war fatigue in Russia, with a recent poll showing 50 per cent in favour of a negotiated peace.

At the same time, Boris Nadezhdin, a politician who wanted to run against Putin, has campaigned for an end to the war. He collected more than 20,000 signatures to run in the upcoming presidential election, but he wasn't allowed into the race.

Multiple experts say Ukraine's best strategy, for the time being, is to dig in and create the kind of defensive positions that the Russians have created on their side of the line — the fortifications and anti-tank ditches that helped blunt Ukraine's counteroffensive in the east and south last summer.

At the moment, RUSI estimates Russia has approximately 4,780 artillery pieces, 1,130 rocket-launcher artillery systems, 2,060 tanks of various designs and 7,080 other armoured fighting vehicles. It is also supported by 290 helicopters, of which 110 are attack helicopters, and 310 fixed-wing fighter-bombers.

It's an army that will only continue growing, the British think-tank said.

""Russia is delivering approximately 1,500 tanks to its forces per year, along with approximately 3,000 armoured fighting vehicles of various types,"" the RUSI report said.

""Russian missile production has similarly increased.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

win fuels ongoing U.S. debate: Are Democrats in better shape than polls suggest?  CBC.ca,"The results of a special election this week poured fuel on a debate raging among American political observers.

The topic: Are Democrats actually in better shape than they appear heading into this year's presidential election?

Because by conventional standards, they seem to be in pretty rough shape. Poll after poll shows Donald Trump ahead of President Joe Biden, nationally and in swing states.

In fact, Trump has never enjoyed surveys this good, not in either of his past two elections, which he won and nearly won.

On the other side, doubters of these polls insist that what matters is results. Real election results. By that standard, Democrats are enjoying a hot streak.

This week they reclaimed the New York City district previously held by Republican congressman George Santos — the accused fraudster infamous for lying about being Jewish, about where he went to school and worked, and about his mother dying in a terrorist attack.

It's no isolated success, either. Democrats defied both the polls and history last year for an incumbent party — they gained a Senate seat, almost held the House, gained two state governorships, took control of four state legislative chambers and won a string of special elections.

'See you in November'

""We'll see you in November,"" Rep. Ted Lieu said Wednesday, the day after Democrats won Santos's seat. He ascribed the win to voters recognizing which of the major parties actually cares about governing.

""What are Republicans focused on? Stupid stuff, like baseless impeachments with no evidence, stopping a national security package that's going to improve America's national security, and doing things that no one in America really wants them to do…. The American people want a Congress that actually does something.""

Needless to say, Republicans drew contradictory conclusions from the result.

They pointed to the Democrats' advantages in this race: they spent heavily ; ran a well-known former congressman and mayor against an unknown Republican criticized for avoiding public events ; and in a district with a history of swinging wildly between parties, they capitalized on Santos's inimitable array of personal scandals.

""There are a lot of factors there. That [result] is in no way a bellwether of what will happen this fall,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson said. ""There is a fervour among the American people. People know this country is on the wrong track.""

Shift in voter habits

So what's going on here?

What's undisputedly happening is that there's a shift helping Democrats perform better than they once did in low-turnout contests like Tuesday's byelection in New York.

The parties are undergoing a realignment in their voter coalitions — with the college-educated, and the most politically engaged, voters drifting toward the Democrats.

WATCH | Could the Democrats replace Joe Biden as their presidential candidate? Could the Democrats replace Joe Biden? Duration 6:57 U.S. President Joe Biden has come out swinging against a special council report that called him 'an elderly man with a poor memory.' With an election just months away, CBC’s Asha Tomlinson asks Washington insiders Brian Stelter and Philip Bump to break down where the Democrats go from here.

Just look at the historical trendline.

College-educated voters now constitute nearly half of the Democratic electorate — that's double their share from 2000. These voters now make up a far higher share of the Democratic electorate than the Republican one.

It's a historic reversal: these voters used to identify primarily as Republicans.

Republicans used to win most college-educated voters until 2000 , but a gradual shift occurred, and it accelerated during the Trump era, culminating in Democrats winning college graduates by about 12 points in 2020.

These sorts of voters are statistically likelier to turn out in an election like Tuesday's: a low-participation race, during a winter blizzard, to decide a single seat that won't change control of Congress.

This extended a hot streak for Democrats that began in mid-2022, when the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion, unleashing a torrent of anger and activism on the political left.

Does win streak translate to another presidency?

Democrats have been repeatedly over-performing polls. And not just that: they've been improving on past election results. In four districts that have held special elections since the 2022 midterms, Democrats have improved on their previous score in all four, including by a whopping 15 points in a couple of them.

Is any of this predictive of what might happen in this fall's presidential election?

The head of an election data company acknowledges Democrats have reason to be pleased with recent results.

""They have certainly done very well in special elections,"" said Drew McCoy, president of Decision Desk HQ, in an interview this week.

But he adds a big caveat. These results don't tell us much about a presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

""Special elections tend not to be predictive,"" McCoy said.

This goes back to the types of voters who show up in presidential versus non-presidential elections. In the midterm elections of both 2022 and 2018, 43 per cent of voters had a college degree.

This is significantly higher than the percentage who had one in presidential elections, six points higher than in 2016 and four points higher than in 2020 . Given the close results in presidential swing states, that's a potentially game-changing difference.

Concerns about the fall

The Democrats' lead pollster in the New York race this week, Mike Bocian, said the turnout numbers left him feeling positive about November.

He said the Democratic candidate, Tom Suozzi, tapped into a deep desire of voters for solutions, rather than virulent partisanship.

Bocian lauded Suozzi's centrist message on what's been a difficult issue for Democrats — the border and immigration. Suozzi advocated more border security, but also more legal immigration, and he contrasted that with Republicans' alleged obstructionism after that party blocked a border deal.

""That is where the public is,"" Bocian told a podcast hosted by The New Republic magazine. ""What they want, mostly, is solutions.""

Yet he acknowledged lingering concerns about the fall.

One worry is whether lower-propensity voters will turn out in droves for Trump; the former president twice broke a record for most votes received by a Republican candidate.

The other is whether the Democratic base holds together. Young voters, and voters of colour, are unusually disenchanted with Biden, which is a major reason he has fallen behind in the polls.

Bocian said Biden's campaign must communicate to these voters the threat of a national abortion ban should Republicans win this fall.

Behind that, he said, the campaign has to adjust its usual timetable.

Rather than wait until later in the race to contact base voters in a final get-out-the-vote push, he urged immediate outreach.

""I think that's gotta change this cycle,"" Bocian said. ""We need to be reaching out early, often, and making the case to these younger voters and voters of colour.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

U.S., U.K. endorse framework to fight foreign information manipulation  CBC.ca","Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom say they're ""deeply concerned"" about foreign information manipulation and have jointly endorsed a framework to counter the threat.

""The time is now for a collective approach to the foreign information manipulation threat that builds a coalition of like-minded countries committed to strengthening resilience and response to information manipulation,"" the three countries said in a joint media release on Friday.

The framework they're endorsing was released in mid-January by the U.S. State Department. It outlines multiple principles for fighting foreign information manipulation, such as supporting independent media and encouraging countries to go beyond ""monitor-and-report"" approaches.

Since last August, a string of reports have highlighted concerns from various Canadian organizations about disinformation campaigns targeting the country.

During that month, Global Affairs Canada (GAC) said a disinformation operation on the Chinese social media platform WeChat spread false information about Conservative MP Michael Chong's identity and political stances.

Later in October, GAC said the Chinese government was likely behind a ""spamouflage"" disinformation campaign targeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and other MPs.

A ""spamouflage"" campaign uses hijacked social media accounts to post propaganda messages across social media platforms.

GAC said the posts claimed a critic of the Chinese Communist Party in Canada accused various MPs of criminal and ethical violations. GAC said the posts likely involved ""deepfake"" manipulated videos.

But the heightened attention on foreign information manipulation isn't restricted to Canada.

WATCH | PM, MPs targets of disinformation campaign: China likely targeted PM, MPs in propaganda campaign, Global Affairs says Duration 2:01 Global Affairs Canada says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre and other MPs were the targets of a ‘spamouflage’ campaign, likely by China's government, that spread propaganda and disinformation on social media.

Major world powers are increasingly worried about the spread of misinformation through social media platforms that are harder to contain — especially in a year where countries making up over 60 per cent of global economic output, including the U.S., Britain and India, are due to hold elections.

""Securing the integrity of the global information ecosystem is central to popular confidence in governance institutions and processes, trust in elected leaders, and the preservation of democracy,"" the joint release said.

Expert says framework is 'innovative'

Marcus Kolga, founder of DisinfoWatch, said the announcement is ""very good news.

""I think it'll help very quickly build a societal resilience against foreign information manipulation, especially the kind that comes from Russia and comes from China,"" he said.

The framework itself is also ""innovative"" because it focuses on cooperating with civil society and academia, Kolga said.

""Civil society often gets overlooked, but it's civil society that's really in the trenches fighting foreign information, manipulation and the influence operations."" he added.

Marcus Kolga, founder of DisinfoWatch, says the framework that Canada, the U.S. and U.K. have jointly endorsed is 'innovative' because it includes a focus on civil society and how it can counter foreign information manipulation. (Benjamin Lopez Steven/CBC)

Emerson Brooking, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said the ""number one benefit"" of incorporating civil society is transparency.

""In a democracy, we fight to ensure that there is free expression of the citizens of a given country. As a result, when the government just tells us that something is foreign interference, there is an understandable suspicion that people can have,"" Brooking said.

The more research takes place in the open, he said, ""the better it is for speech rights and the better it is for the confidence of citizens that governments are focused just on the foreign information threat.""

Kolga said he expects governments of countries like China, Russia and Iran to use artificial intelligence tools to ""plant all sorts of stories"" about candidates or parties critical of their regimes during elections in powerful countries this year.

Canadians should be aware that they're being actively targeted by influence operations and should be ""keeping an eye"" on the sources of their information, Kolga said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

years on, the war in Ukraine becomes a test of Western staying power  CBC News","Anniversaries — like birthdays — can be awkward events.

And the more of them you have, the more awkward they become — especially when you're called upon to mark the onset of the enormous carnage, misery and loss that has been the experience of Ukraine for the last two years.

Almost in passing, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — after signing a long-term security assurance package with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday — remarked how 24 months ago, no one expected to be here.

While it was partially a reference to the well-worn assertion that Moscow — and many in the West — had expected a swift Russian victory following its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Trudeau, perhaps inadvertently, touched on the dismay that is at the heart of wavering support among the world's democracies.

How could this still be going on?

This weekend saw a deluge of military, economic and political explanations and prognostications that dissected where we've come from and where we might be going.

WATCH | Trudeau discusses strength of Canadian support for Ukraine: Canadians still support Ukraine despite 'faltering' by Conservatives, Trudeau says Duration 1:17 Speaking from Kyiv as world leaders marked the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians remain 'overwhelmingly in favour' of supporting Ukraine despite 'Russian misinformation and disinformation' and what he called an 'unfortunate' decision by federal Conservatives to vote against economic measures for Ukraine.

What was largely unspoken in Kyiv but implicit in the security packages signed this weekend by Canada and Italy (and earlier by the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Denmark) is that with this anniversary, we have crossed a Rubicon, one that Western democracies have not had to face in such a visceral and substantial way since the Second World War.

The early wars of the 21st century, in Afghanistan and Iraq, may well be viewed through the long lens of history as a test of patience, rather than what Ukraine is shaping up to be.

The long, bloody, expensive and excruciating road ahead will be a test of the staying power of societies — within Ukraine and perhaps even on a grander scale.

We're seeing signs of it in Ukraine with the debate over expanded troop mobilization to fill dwindling, exhausted ranks. There are slightly more opaque flashes within Russia, where in Moscow over the weekend, Russian military wives protested after being told their husbands were gone for the duration of the war.

War over morale

And in this contest of wills, experts say, political messaging is important.

""What the Russians want to do now is to convince everybody that the Ukrainian case is hopeless,"" said Eliot Cohen, the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former counselor at the U.S. State Department.

The narrative seeping into the political discourse in the West, he said, is that ""the Russians are relentless, have resources that are essentially infinite and an infinite willingness to suffer. Now, I don't think any of those things are true, but I think that's a large part of what the Russians want us to believe.""

WATCH | World leaders commemorate second anniversary of invasion: Why leaders visited this Ukrainian airport on anniversary of Russia's invasion Duration 1:44 Hostomel Airport, located just outside of Kyiv, was the site of one of the first battles between Ukrainian troops and invading Russian forces two years ago. CBC's Margaret Evans explains the significance of the visit to the airport by leaders from countries such as Canada.

Trudeau, speaking to Canadian reporters in Kyiv after a virtual G7 leaders' meeting Saturday night, wasn't prepared to acknowledge what we're seeing as a contest of wills but instead described it as people buying into Kremlin propaganda.

""We've seen the impact of Russian misinformation and disinformation in countries all around the world,"" Trudeau said, while underlining how he believed Canada's $3-billion security assistance package demonstrated a depth of commitment.

""I just got off a call, a virtual video conference with the other G7 leaders, where we are all aligned and filled with resolve that we will continue to stand with Ukraine and continue to ensure that Russia does not win this war.""

Dominique Arel, chair of Ukrainian studies at the University of Ottawa, said he's seeing signs of increased European resolve, but he wonders how much staying power there is in Canada.

He pointed to the federal government's reluctance to increase munitions production and its steadfast refusal to say whether the country will attempt to meet NATO's benchmark of two per cent of gross domestic product for defence spending.

The Europeans, Arel said, are no longer looking at Ukraine as ""a one-off"" and have begun to recognize and steel themselves for a long struggle, rather than just hoping the war will be over tomorrow.

Importance of the U.S. stance

Emily Harding, director of the intelligence, national security and technology program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the recent death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the disclosure that the Kremlin may soon put a nuclear device in orbit were unmistakable signals from President Vladimir Putin meant to instil fear in Europe.

""The fact that Putin allowed this right before the Munich [Security] Conference is quite interesting,"" Harding said during a recent online panel at the centre marking the second anniversary of the war in Ukraine.

""It's quite a bold message that here we are on the two-year anniversary of this war, and his No. 1 political critic he feels like he can eliminate, with little to no blowback ... I think was a very scary message to the Europeans. And I wish that we would get there, as well.""

Whether the United States, the biggest military and economic backer of Ukraine, has the strength of will for the long haul is suspect.

A lot of attention has been paid lately to the refusal of congressional Republicans to go along with the latest $60-billion US aid package proposed for Ukraine. Harding said the incremental approach of the Biden administration has helped create the circumstances today.

""The U.S. response has been dithering,"" she said about the debates within the administration concerning which donated weapons systems might provoke a response from Russia. ""I think uncharitably you could say that we've been fiddling while Rome burns.""

As part of the ongoing contest of wills, Harding said, the West, led by the U.S., cannot allow Moscow to ""continue to push forward without pushing back.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

Mulroney rallied nations against apartheid in South Africa  CBC.ca,"Three months after becoming prime minister in 1984, Brian Mulroney hosted Desmond Tutu, the bishop of Johannesburg and a powerful South African anti-apartheid leader, in his office in Ottawa.

That meeting not only solidified Mulroney's long-standing opposition to apartheid — the racist policy that imposed white-minority rule over South Africa's majority Black population — it also galvanized Canada's 18th prime minister into action.

""I sought [Tutu's] advice on what role Canada might play in the seemingly stalled efforts to free Nelson Mandela and end apartheid in South Africa. 'Do you think a middle power like Canada could have an effective impact on the situation?' I asked him,"" Mulroney recalled in a 2015 Globe and Mail opinion piece.

""Bishop Tutu was vigorous in his response: 'I think Canada can have an important, even a lead role in translating morality into political action.'""

Mulroney's subsequent public denunciations of apartheid and efforts to marshal Western opposition against it were never forgotten by the nation. Current South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his sadness Friday at the ""passing of a leader who holds a special place in South Africa's history.""

""For us, his passing is made profound by the fact that we have lost this friend and ally in the year in which we are marking 30 years of freedom and in which we pay tribute to all those around the world who supported our struggle for freedom and democracy.

""May his soul rest in peace.""

While academics and critics continue to debate the overall effectiveness of Canadian actions under the Mulroney government, South Africa awarded Mulroney in 2015 the Order of the Companions of O.R. Tambo for ""his exceptional contribution to the liberation of South Africa.""

'An extraordinary moment'

A year after his meeting with Tutu in Ottawa, and fresh off securing an initial agreement among Commonwealth leaders to impose limited economic sanctions against South Africa, Mulroney warned the government in Pretoria that Canada was prepared to go further.

""Only one country has established colour as the hallmark of systemic inequality and repression. Only South Africa determines the fundamental human rights of individuals and groups within its society by this heinous method of classification,"" Mulroney said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly.

""My government has said to Canadians that if there are not fundamental changes in South Africa, we are prepared to invoke total sanctions against that country and its repressive regime. If there is no progress in the dismantling of apartheid, Canada's relations with South Africa may have to be severed absolutely.""

Stephen Lewis, Mulroney's ambassador to the United Nations from 1984 to 1988, described the prime minister's warning to South Africa as a pivotal moment in the General Assembly.

""You have to have been in the General Assembly to appreciate what happened when those words were uttered,"" Lewis reportedly said in 2014. ""I was at the UN for four glorious years. I had never seen anything like it before, and I never saw anything like it afterwards. It was an extraordinary moment. It was, for all the African delegations, a moment of hope.""

Commonwealth leaders were not unanimous in their support for sanctions against South Africa. Mulroney publicly clashed with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in July of 1986.

Thatcher opposed imposing economic penalties on South Africa, describing sanctions as ""immoral"" and ""utterly repugnant."" She argued, at a press conference in Montreal, that the best way to end apartheid was through negotiation.

""It's all about dealing with a regime that is rooted in evil, when an entire generation of people have been suppressed, deprived of their fundamental rights, their liberty and dignity as human beings,"" Mulroney told reporters after Thatcher departed. ""It ought to be unacceptable to all of us of the Commonwealth and all prime ministers.""

A month later, Thatcher agreed to limited sanctions against South Africa.

Mulroney's push for economic sanctions also bumped up against opposition in the White House.

While U.S. President Ronald Reagan described apartheid as an ""affront to human rights and human dignity,"" he vetoed legislation in 1986 that would impose new economic sanctions against Pretoria. Congress subsequently voted to override Reagan's veto.

Reflecting on his conversations with the U.S. president in the 1980s, Mulroney wrote in his 2007 memoir that Reagan ""saw the whole South African issue strictly in East-West Cold War terms.""

""Over the years, he and [Thatcher] continually raised with me their fears that Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders were communists,"" wrote Mulroney.

By 1988, South Africa's economy was being squeezed by sanctions and corporate disinvestment.

""The movement in favour of human dignity is now irreversible,"" Mulroney said in a speech that year before the UN General Assembly. ""There can be no doubt that fundamental change will come to South Africa. The only questions are when and how and at what cost in human life.

""We must make sure the answers come soon, and peacefully — and that a framework is preserved that will give rise to a non-racial democratic South Africa. Only then will the children of Mandela know the gifts that freedom brings.""

'A true friend'

After 27 years in prison, Mandela was released unconditionally on Feb. 11, 1990. Mandela called Mulroney a day later to thank the prime minister and Canada for advocating the end of apartheid.

Four months later, Mandela travelled to Ottawa and delivered a speech to a joint session of the House of Commons and the Senate.

""I would like to take this opportunity to salute the great Canadian people whom you represent, and with whom we believe you are in full accord on the question of South Africa. They have proved themselves not only to be steadfast friends of our struggling people but great defenders of human rights and the idea of democracy itself,"" said Mandela.

Nelson Mandela raises his arms as he is acknowledged by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and other members of Parliament in Ottawa, June 18, 1990. Former prime minister Brian Mulroney is dead at 84. His family announced late Thursday that the former Tory leader died peacefully, surrounded by loved ones. (Fred Chartrand/The Canadian Press)

""Mr. Prime Minister, our people and organization respect and admire you as a true friend. We have been greatly strengthened by your personal involvement in the struggle against apartheid and the leadership you have provided within the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the Group of Seven and the Francophone summits.

""We are certain that you will, together with the rest of the Canadian people, stay the course with us, not only as we battle on to end the apartheid system but also as we work to build a happy, peaceful and prosperous future for all the people of South and Southern Africa.""

Four years later, Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

Navalny's death  CBC News","Canadian lawmakers are denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government following news that prominent opposition figure Alexei Navalny died while serving his sentence in a prison in the Arctic Circle.

""The death of Alexei Navalny has us all reeling,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an interview Friday with CBC News in Winnipeg. ""It's something that has the entire world being reminded of exactly what a monster Putin is.

""There is no question that Alexei Navalny is dead because he stood up to Putin, he stood up to the Kremlin. He stood for freedom and democracy and the right of the Russian people to choose their future, and that was something that Putin was deeply afraid of, as he should be.""

The prime minister added that Navalny's death redoubles the resolve of Canada and other Western nations to stand up to Putin's abuses of human rights and international law.

In a social media post, Trudeau said Navalny's courage was unparalleled and sent his condolences to Navalny's family and supporters.

""To be clear: He should never have been imprisoned to begin with. Let this be an important reminder that we must continue to promote, protect and defend democracy everywhere. The consequences of not doing so are stark,"" Trudeau wrote on X.

WATCH: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addresses Navalny's death Trudeau reflects on Navalny's 'extraordinary courage' following reports of his death Duration 1:43 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Alexei Navalny was a fighter for human rights, democracy and standing up for the Russian people and the country's future. Navalny's reported death is a moment to reflect on his courage and inspiration and ""double and triple down in our resolve"" to stand up against Vladimir Putin, Trudeau added.

Navalny, 47, was arrested by Russian authorities in 2021 upon his return to the country after spending five months in Germany recovering from poisoning by a nerve agent. He was accused and convicted in a series of cases involving charges of embezzlement, fraud and extremism.

Conservatives condemn Putin: Poilievre

The opposition figure's death was announced on Friday by the Federal Penitentiary Service of the Yamalo-Nenets region, where Navalny had been serving his sentences.

Prison authorities said Navalny ""felt unwell"" after a walk on Friday and ""almost immediately lost consciousness.""

The statement said medical staff were called but were unable to resuscitate him. The authorities said the cause of death was being established.

Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly echoed the prime minister's comments.

""Alexei Navalny gave his freedom in the hopes of a better, more democratic future for the Russian people. Reports of his death are a painful reminder of Putin's continued oppressive regime,"" Joly wrote on social media. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Yulia, his family, and his loved ones.""

Canada's Ambassador to the United Nations Bob Rae placed the blame for Navalny's death on the Russian president.

""Putin murdered Navalny just as surely as if he'd strangled him with his bare hands,"" Rae wrote on X.

Reports of Alexei Navalny’s death are tragic and horrifying. An unwavering advocate for Russian democracy and freedom, his courage was unparalleled.<br> <br>To be clear: He should never have been imprisoned to begin with. Let this be an important reminder that we must continue to… —@JustinTrudeau

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland wrote on social media that Navalny ""spent his life speaking out for a better future for the Russian people, in hopes that democracy and peace — not Putin's tyranny and war — prevail.""

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre also blamed Putin for Navalny's death.

""Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has died in prison. Putin imprisoned Navalny for the act of opposing the regime. Conservatives condemn Putin for his death,"" Poilievre wrote on X.

WATCH | Canada's UN ambassador calls Navalny's death a 'genuine atrocity' Canada’s UN ambassador calls Navalny’s death a ‘genuine atrocity’ Duration 8:06 Canada’s Ambassador to the United Nations Bob Rae tells Power & Politics that ‘any sensible person would say Putin is responsible.’ On Friday, a Russian prison authority reported that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny had died.

The party's foreign affairs critic, Michael Chong, wrote that Navalny was imprisoned simply for being an opposition leader.

""Conservatives condemn Putin and the Russian Federation for his death. This is not the hallmark of a great power but of a pariah state,"" Chong said.

Garnett Genuis, Conservative international development critic, accused Putin of murdering Navalny.

""The despicable murder of Alexei Navalny by Vladimir Putin underlines what is at stake in the Ukraine war, and more broadly in the global struggle between the democratic world and the anti-democratic world,"" Genuis wrote on X. ""We must rise to the challenge.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he was saddened by reports of the opposition figure's death.

""Navalny's important work exposed corruption by Putin's oligarchs and he was killed for it,"" Singh wrote on social media. ""My thoughts are with his loved ones and with all political prisoners targeted by Putin.""

NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson said she was horrified by the news.

""He bravely exposed the corruption and greed of Putin and his oligarchs and was poisoned and killed for it. His death is on Putin's hands,"" McPherson wrote on social media. ""My condolences to the Russian people and all those who loved Mr. Navalny.""

Navalny: 'You're not allowed to give up'

In the Oscar-winning documentary Navalny, the opposition figure anticipated his death in a message to his supporters.

""You're not allowed to give up. If they decide to kill me, it means that we are incredibly strong,"" Navalny said, speaking in Russian.

""We need to utilize this power to not give up, to remember we are a huge power that is being oppressed by these bad dudes. We don't realize how strong we actually are. The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. So don't be inactive.""

The opposition figure returned to Russia shortly after delivering those remarks. He was arrested by Russian authorities immediately upon landing in Moscow in 2021.

The Russian embassy to Canada urged Canada Friday to ""stop interfering into our internal affairs.""

""Every death is a tragedy. But the death of a Russian citizen is strictly Russia's matter,"" the embassy wrote on X.

Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny's wife, made a surprise appearance Friday at a gathering of world leaders in Munich.

Speaking just hours after her husband was reported dead, Navalnaya vowed to hold Putin and his government accountable.

""If this is true, I want Putin and all of his entourage, Putin's friends and his government to know that they will be held accountable for what they have done to our country, to my family and to my husband. And that day will come very soon,"" said Navalnya.

""I want to call on the entire world community, everyone in this room and people around the world, that we come together to unite and defeat this evil, defeat the horrific regime that is now in Russia.""

Navalnaya received a standing ovation.

Defence Minister Bill Blair also attended the Munich Security Conference.

""It was very emotional, I think, for many of the people here at this conference. It really does speak to the repressive nature of the Putin regime,"" Blair said in an interview with Rosemary Barton Live airing Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

investing in 'large' road projects, environment minister says  CBC News","Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said Monday the federal government will stop investing in new road infrastructure — a comment that immediately drew attacks from the Opposition Conservatives and some premiers who said the climate activist turned politician is out of touch.

Guilbeault later clarified his remarks, telling reporters Wednesday that he meant to say Ottawa will not put up the cash for ""large"" road projects.

""Of course we're funding roads. We have programs to fund roads,"" he said.

Guilbeault said Monday the federal government will be there to support provinces paying for maintenance but Ottawa has decided that existing road infrastructure ""is perfectly adequate to respond to the needs we have.""

""There will be no more envelopes from the federal government to enlarge the road network,"" Guilbeault said, according to quotes published in the Montreal Gazette.

""We can very well achieve our goals of economic, social and human development without more enlargement of the road network.""

Guilbeault said the federal government is intent on moving people out of their cars and into public transportation, which the government has spent billions to build.

He said the federal government also wants to encourage ""active transit,"" which means getting people to walk and cycle.

The minister said federal money that's been spent on asphalt and concrete for roads in the past is ""better invested into projects that will help fight climate change and adapt to its impacts.""

No funding for 'large projects'

Pressed by reporters to defend his comments Wednesday, Guilbeault said he should have been ""more specific"" by stating that the federal government will not be funding ""large projects.""

He cited Quebec City's long-proposed third link as one project that will not receive funding from Ottawa.

""What we have said, and maybe I should have been more specific, is that we don't have funds for large projects like the '3eme lien' that the CAQ has been trying to do for many years,"" he said of Quebec's provincial government.

WATCH | Guilbeault faces backlash over road funding comment: Environment minister faces backlash over road funding comments Duration 2:03 After a Quebec newspaper reported that Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said the federal government would stop investing in new road infrastructure, the minister later clarified he was referring to a particularly large project in Quebec City. But the political uproar over the initial comment had already started.

A senior government official told CBC News said ""there are no changes to federal policy.""

In question period, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government will continue to invest in ""infrastructure.""

Asked if he'd condemn Guilbeault's assertion that the federal government is getting out of the business of funding some road projects, Trudeau said the minister ""clarified"" his remarks earlier and the government's ""approach to infrastructure continues to be one of investing in the future for Canadians.""

Trudeau defended the government's record on infrastructure, saying Ottawa has helped fund the Champlain bridge in Montreal, the planned Gordie Howe bridge in Windsor and the twinning of the Trans-Canada highway in Newfoundland, among other projects.

The government has spent hefty sums on roads in the past.

The ""gas tax fund,"" which was rebranded by the Liberals as the Canada Community-Building Fund, has routinely delivered billions of dollars to provinces and municipalities to support construction and maintenance of highways and local roads and bridges.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Guilbeault's a ""radical"" who seems intent on banning federal funds from road projects.

Conservative MP Mark Strahl, the party's transport critic, said Guilbeault's talk about no more new funding for ""large"" roads is ""outrageous"" and an affront to the people who rely on cars to get to and from work.

""This isn't something many Canadians do without. To simply say we're not going to allow any federal money to go into that is extreme, it's divisive and it's right in line with what this government does,"" Strahl said.

""But we should expect that from a guy who scaled the CN Tower, climbed on top of a premier's house and was led away in handcuffs. That's the kind of extremism that he's about,"" Strahl said, referring to Guilbeault's past activism, which led to arrests for stunts.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a frequent critic of Guilbeault, pounced on the remarks, saying in a social media post that the Montreal cabinet minister doesn't understand that many Canadians live in suburban, rural and remote areas where transit isn't as well-developed.

""Most of us can't just head out the door in the snow and rain and just walk 10 kilometres to work each day,"" Smith said.

At an unrelated press conference about tourism in Alberta, Smith said Wednesday that Guilbeault is ""tone deaf.""

""He's losing credibility every single day. I don't know why his caucus and his cabinet is putting up with it — that's something they will have to deal with internally,"" she said.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford is another premier who has had choice words for Guilbeault in the past — he's called Guilbeault ""a real piece of work"" and an ""extremist."" Ford said Wednesday he was ""gobsmacked"" by Guilbeault's latest policy pronouncement.

""A federal minister said they won't invest in new roads or highways,"" Ford said in a social media post.

""He doesn't care that you're stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I do. We're building roads and highways, with or without a cent from the feds.""

WATCH: Canada aims to phase out sales of gas-powered cars and trucks by 2035: Canada's plan to phase out gas-powered car and truck sales by 2035 Duration 2:04 The federal government is laying out its final plan to phase out new, gas-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, with gradually increasing targets for manufacturers to meet.

Guilbeault's comments put into question the future of Ford's promised Highway 413 project, a new highway in the northwest part of the Greater Toronto Area that will connect two major arteries in the area and ease travel between booming areas like Vaughan and Brampton.

Ontario has argued that the project should be fast-tracked because the population growth in these Toronto suburbs demands more infrastructure to ease congestion.

Environmentalists and some local groups have vigorously opposed the 60-kilometre highway because it will cut through farmland and waterways and pave over parts of the province's protected greenbelt.

Lengthy review

In that context, the federal government decided in 2021 that the project should be subjected to Ottawa's impact assessment, which means it will go through a more stringent and lengthy environmental review.

The Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, which carries out these reviews, reports to Guilbeault.

Late last year, Ford said if Brampton Liberal MPs don't support the project, they risk losing their jobs in the next election because voters there want to see highways like this built.

""Just look at what happened when Highway 413 worked out for the Liberal and NDP candidates right here in Brampton — they all got swept because they didn't agree with 413,"" he said, referring to his party's victory in the 2022 provincial election.

Mixed record in the courts

Guilbeault has pursued an ambitious climate agenda since taking the job in 2021. He's a keen proponent of the plan to hike the federal carbon tax to discourage the use of fossil fuels like oil and gas and he's the lead minister on the push to green the country's electricity grid.

Guilbeault's clean electricity draft regulations require that the country's grid be net-zero by 2035. That's a tall order for provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan where coal and natural gas are key fuel sources for power generation.

The premiers of those provinces have called the measure an act of jurisdictional overreach on Ottawa's part and have vowed to fight it.

The government's climate agenda has a mixed record in the courts.

The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the Liberal carbon pricing scheme.

But in a 2023 reference case, the top court found the government's impact assessment bill — which gives Ottawa the authority to review projects like Highway 413 — was largely unconstitutional.

The court said many provisions of Bill C-69 gave Ottawa powers that were too broad and not linked closely enough to what the Constitution calls federal business.

A reference case is not legally binding, but the decision did force Ottawa to consider that ruling when crafting its cap on oil and gas emissions.

As for the government's push to ban single-use plastics by deeming them ""toxic,"" the Federal Court ruled last year that the policy is ""unreasonable and unconstitutional.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

visa rules for Mexican nationals turn families, tourists into collateral damage, loved ones say  CBC.ca","Having just tucked his oldest son into bed on Wednesday evening, Sebastian Ibarra walked into his living room at home in British Columbia's North Okanagan district and saw a text from his spouse asking if he'd seen the news.

He did a quick online search and learned that the federal government was reimposing some visa requirements on visiting Mexican nationals to curb the number of asylum claims in Canada and stem the flow of people crossing into the United States.

Taken aback, Ibarra said he thought of his parents and brother — who are supposed to visit him from Mexico this summer.

""I was disappointed,"" he said. ""The system [is trying] to find a scapegoat rather than actually finding a permanent, long-term solution to this issue.""

Ibarra is among those whose loved ones are affected by Ottawa's new rules, which take effect at 11:30 p.m. ET on Thursday.

Several people who spoke with CBC News said they can understand the need to improve the country's immigration system, but they believe the changes introduced this week could turn visitors, tourists and separated families into collateral damage.

WATCH | How new visa requirements in Canada affect Mexican nationals: What Canada's new visa requirements mean for Mexican nationals Duration 5:03 While CBC Radio-Canada journalist Louis Blouin described Canada's new visa requirements for Mexican nationals as a 'half-measure' that does not go as far as the policies of Stephen Harper's government that were struck down by the reigning Liberals, Blouin says these measures could create a tense diplomatic situation with Mexico.

Ibarra, then 19, arrived in Winnipeg from Mexico City in 2006. He finished his undergraduate degree at the University of Manitoba and completed his master's degree in B.C. before taking a job in Prince Edward Island. In 2021, he and his spouse moved back west so their sons — Xavi, 5, and Niko, 2 — could be closer to their maternal grandparents.

Now in his 30s, Ibarra said he is acutely familiar with the country's immigration system. He went through multiple visa renewals, work permits and permanent resident applications before becoming a Canadian citizen 2½ years ago.

His parents are in their 70s, and his brother is a graduate student with a one-year-old child. Ibarra said he can't see them taking the time to apply for a visa and pay the fees just for a summer visit.

""I think that perhaps spending time with my families this summer will definitely be affected by this,"" he said in a phone interview on Thursday.

""And I recognize that I'm a privileged individual looking to spend leisure time with their family, hoping to inviting them and spend time with us,"" he said. ""There's other individuals that may have not seen their family for a long time due to financial constraints, [like] international students here in Canada maybe looking forward to spend the summer with their parents back in Mexico.""

On Thursday, Immigration Minister Marc Miller said Ottawa would be reinstating visa requirements for travellers from Mexico to reduce the number of asylum claims and the number of people crossing from Canada into the United States.

More than 25,000 Mexicans applied for asylum in Canada last year, making Mexico the top source of asylum claims, according to statistics from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada . There are currently more than 28,000 backlogged claims from Mexico currently filed with the board.

The U.S. government has been asking Ottawa to bring back the visa requirement. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Quebec Premier François Legault had also urged Ottawa to mitigate the number of asylum claims.

WATCH | Mexico visa policies could violate refugees' rights, advocate says: Canada's new Mexico visa policies threaten refugees' rights, advocate says Duration 1:23 Luisa Ortiz-Garza, an organizer with the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, says Canada is not living up to its obligations as a signatory to multiple refugee conventions by imposing new visa requirements for Mexican nationals. 'People fleeing persecution and [seeking] asylum should be able to come here and claim that protection,' says Ortiz-Garza, who lived in in Canada for more than a decade undocumented before getting her permanent residency.

Alberto Garcya, a Mexican national who holds a Canadian work permit, said he can understand the rationale behind the rule change but worries the requirement will impact visitors and tourists who have no intent to stay in the country for the long term.

""I think there's a lot of collateral damage, and that's the sad part or downside of it,"" said Garcya, whose parents in Mexico will now have to apply for a visa to come visit him and his daughter.

Diana Castillo, a Canadian citizen, said she thinks the government made the right decision to ensure people who intend to stay permanently follow the rules, as she had to do when she emigrated from Mexico.

""We know what it's like to wait and to have to follow protocol and rules and have everything in order to receive a permanent residency and then a citizenship. So it is a lengthy process, but everybody should should try to follow it,"" Castillo said in an interview from Vancouver International Airport on Thursday.

""It's kind of sad again because that'll put restrictions on people who come and visit for vacation only, but I think it's a necessary measure to take.""

Ibarra said he believes Canada bowed to political pressure coming from the U.S. during a presidential election year.

""There may be some pressures from the base of certain parties to take stronger stance on some of these issues that unfortunately have become too political and too hot,"" he said.

""It's that old saying: When the U.S. sneezes, Canada catches a cold.""

40% of people travelling from Mexico will need visa

An estimated 60 per cent of people travelling from Mexico will not actually need a visa under the new rules, according to the federal government.

Mexican citizens flying to Canada can apply for an electronic travel authorization if they have held a Canadian visa within the last decade or if they have a valid U.S. visa.

Any electronic travel authorizations that had been issued before Thursday evening are invalid unless the person also has a valid Canadian work or study permit.

People travelling to Canada without a work or study permit must reapply for authorization or apply for a visitor visa.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

Liberal MP rips his government's policy on Gaza war in private call with constituent  CBC News,"A leaked recording of a phone call between a Liberal MP and a constituent suggests the depth of the divisions in the government caucus over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's handling of the war in Gaza, the genocide case against Israel and the decision to defund a UN relief agency in the middle of a famine.

As parliamentary secretary to Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, Rob Oliphant has the job of explaining and defending Canada's foreign policy in Parliament.

But in his conversation with the constituent, recorded on Feb. 1 without the MP's knowledge, Oliphant was clearly less than keen to defend the government.

Instead, he opened up about his reaction to the genocide allegation brought against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague and Canada's decision to defund the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the main UN agency providing aid to Palestinian refugees.

""My heart falls down in my body. My heart hurts, because the only way to get that aid there is UNRWA. - Liberal MP Rob Oliphant

He also revealed that he's considered quitting his job as Joly's parliamentary secretary.

""I've come many times thinking, 'Do I quit that job? Do I just go back to being an MP?'"" Oliphant said on the call.

CBC News is not identifying the constituent — who has been calling for a ceasefire in the conflict — because she fears publicity would lead to professional reprisals.

When contacted by CBC News, Oliphant said the conversation was with a constituent who was in pain over the crisis in Gaza and he'd hoped it would remain private.

He also said he made no statements in that exchange that he would not be willing to defend in public.

Defunding UNRWA the 'wrong decision,' MP says

""When I read that we were pausing money to UNRWA — I'm going to be very clear — it was political. And I don't just mean domestic politics. It has to do with our allies,"" Oliphant told his constituent. ""I thought it was the wrong decision.""

Canada was the second country in the world to suspend its funding for UNRWA, following the United States. It did so in response to an Israeli claim that 12 or 13 UNRWA staff had participated in various capacities in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

Israel accused 10 of the men of being Hamas members and one of belonging to Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

The war in Gaza began after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel by Hamas-led militants in which 1,200 people were killed, including several Canadian citizens, according to Israeli accounts. Israel has responded with a military assault on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian officials.

The Trudeau government cut off UNRWA on January 26 — the same day the ICJ found there were grounds to proceed with a genocide trial against Israel.

In response to South Africa's allegation that Israel was using starvation as a weapon against Gaza's civilian population, the court ordered that ""the State of Israel shall take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.""

That ruling is binding on all countries that signed the Genocide Convention, including Canada.

Israel said it would provide intelligence to back up its allegation against UNRWA but has yet to do so. The funding suspension has continued and hundreds of thousands of Gazans have fallen into severe hunger.

Oliphant said on the call that, even if the Israeli allegation is true, he doesn't agree with the Trudeau government's response.

""You don't stop aid to Gaza because of 12 or 13 employees out of 13,000. It drives me crazy,"" he said. ""It is opportunistic, it is unfair, and it is maligning the operation of a UN organization that is doing, not perfect work — there's no organization that's made of human beings that's perfect, UNRWA has its faults. But it is the best we have for education, for medical care, for food, all of those things.""

Oliphant, who is both a member of Parliament and a minister of the United Church, added that if the government was determined to cut UNRWA off, it should have found ways to redirect the aid flow immediately.

LISTEN: Government dropped the ball on UNRWA funding, MP says Government 'bungled' UNRWA funding issue, Oliphant says Duration 1:26 Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, the parliamentary secretary to Canada's foreign affairs minister, said he believes Canada should not have halted aid to UNRWA in response to allegations that 12 of its employees were involved in the Oct. 7 attacks. Oliphant made the comments in a call with a constituent who is advocating for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.

""I would have done it completely differently. I would have immediately said exactly the same money will flow to humanitarian assistance, we'll just find other ways to do it temporarily,"" he said.

""Our government bungled that and we should have announced it the same day. All that money and more needs to go to Gaza for instantaneous humanitarian aid.

""We have half a million people at starvation levels. We're going to have cholera. We're going to have all kinds of things in Gaza. We need an immediate ceasefire.""

Oliphant has a long history of involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his exchange with the constituent, he discussed his many visits to the region and to UNRWA camps, and his close personal friendship with a former Gaza director of UNRWA, Matthias Schmale, who was effectively expelled from the territory in 2021 after giving an interview to Israeli television that angered Hamas.

""I will defend UNRWA forever. Their work in Lebanon, their work in Jordan, I've been there, I've been to the refugee camps,"" he said. ""I've examined the curriculum that people have gone crazy about, saying it's antisemitic. I don't believe it is. I think UNRWA is maligned every day.""

Oliphant also spoke on the call of the need to be sensitive to the feelings of Canada's Jewish population and the ""intergenerational trauma"" caused by the Holocaust.

Ninety to 95 per cent of Canada's Jews are behind Israel right now, Oliphant said, adding, ""I understand it.""

""But I also understand that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu is hurting Israel. Not only killing Gazans, but hurting Israel. So for the love of Israel, tell him to stop.""

LISTEN: Liberal MP says he predicted position on Gaza would be 'misunderstood' Liberal MP says he knew Canada's ICJ message would be misunderstood Duration 0:35 Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, parliamentary secretary to Canada's foreign affairs minister, said he advised the government not to say it doesn't 'accept the premise' of South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The government was accused of spreading confusion about its position following its statements on the case last month. Oliphant made the comments in a call with a constituent who is advocating for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.

On the same call, Oliphant also criticized the government's response to the ICJ case, which caused widespread confusion about where Canada stands.

Statements by Trudeau and Joly were widely misreported in mainstream media and on social media as dismissing the South African case and taking the side of Israel. In fact, their statements carefully avoided either rejecting or endorsing South Africa's case against Israel.

""I would not have done what the government did and I advised them not to do that, because I knew it would be misunderstood, and I think it was misunderstood as not agreeing with South Africa's case, and that could be perceived as not believing they should bring the case,"" Oliphant said on the call.

""And I'm simply saying no one will understand the nuance of 'it doesn't necessarily mean we agree or disagree' with the case ... So I think that was a communications disaster. We should simply say, 'We're following the case.'""

""Now we should engage in every single piece of work to ensure that we, as signatories to the conventions, are abiding with [them],"" Oliphant added, saying there should be ""no weaseling.""

MP says Israel 'probably' engaged in 'genocidal activity'

He also offered his own viewpoint on the merits of the case against Israel.

""Do I believe there's genocidal activity on the part of Israel?"" he said on the call. ""Probably yes, from what I have seen.""

Oliphant stressed that he's not a legal expert and he was giving his own view, rather than that of the government.

On February 8, Oliphant was challenged in the House of Commons on his government's UNRWA suspension by NDP foreign affairs critic Heather MacPherson.

""Liberals made the decision to suspend life-saving funding to UNRWA without having seen any evidence of allegations or having waited for the results of the independent investigation,"" she said in question period. ""UNRWA is the only organization that can reach Palestinians in Gaza who are starving and who are being killed in the tens of thousands, and the government cut life-saving support.

""The decision needs to be reversed, and somebody needs to be held accountable. Was it the minister or was it the PMO that decided Canada should turn its back on starving Palestinians?""

With the foreign affairs minister in Eastern Europe, it fell to Oliphant to respond:

""Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. The funding that Canada is giving to civilians in Gaza has increased — just last week, $40 million more on top of the $60 million that was already there,"" he said. ""This makes Canada a top donor for aid, helping with the crisis in Gaza. We are proud, and Canadians want us to help. Every time there is a time of emergency, we stand up and we are clear. We will always be there.""

But the pride Oliphant expressed in that answer was not evident in his conversation with the constituent. This is how he described his reaction to the UNRWA decision in that call:

""My heart falls down in my body,"" he said. ""My heart hurts, because the only way to get that aid there is UNRWA.

""We can't have 200 trucks a day. We need 800 trucks a day. We need more entry points. We need water access from the Mediterranean. And we need to push on those points. But we also need UNRWA, which is the only body that has the infrastructure to deliver the aid.""

Oliphant said that any decision to divert UNRWA aid to other channels likely would be symbolic, because ""the reality is that UNICEF or World Food Program or other agencies are going to have to use the same people that work for UNRWA. It's political and it's driving me crazy.""

The Liberal MP said on the call that his role as parliamentary secretary means he is ""not able to be as public as some of my colleagues are.

""I've come many times thinking, 'Do I quit that job? Do I just go back to being an MP?'""

He said a staffer persuaded him to stay on ""because there needs to be a voice on the inside, not just on the outside.""

But Oliphant also warned on the call that the government's approach to the conflict, and that of its western allies, will have dangerous consequences.

""My fear is that the Global South will absolutely rebel and raise arms, maybe literally, because we have not listened,"" he said.

He added that Israel — not other countries — should be made to pay the cost of the war.

call on Canada to donate rockets to Ukraine — but not all are battle-ready  CBC.ca,"The federal Conservatives are demanding that the Liberal government donate to Ukraine tens of thousands of surplus air-to-ground rockets that are slated for disposal.

Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre issued the call Friday during the House of Commons debate on legislation to update the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement.

The Canadian Armed Forces has a stockpile of 83,303 CRV7 rockets, a 1980s-vintage weapon that was taken out of service in the early 2000s.

Three years ago, the federal government signed a contract to dispose of the rockets over several years.

Poilievre said he understands Ukraine has asked Canada to donate the CRV7s instead of destroying them.

""It's time for less talk and more action,"" Poilievre said in a media statement.

""Instead of making Canadians pay millions of dollars to decommission these weapons,"" he said, the weapons should be given ""to Ukraine who can use them in the defence of sovereignty.""

The Department of National Defence (DND) acknowledged Friday that it still has the rockets and they're being considered as part of a possible future military donation package.

The problem — according to a defence official who spoke on background — is that while Canada still has tens of thousands of the rockets and their motors, not all of them have warheads.

A spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair confirmed the government is considering donating the rockets.

""Before sending equipment to Ukraine, we coordinate closely with Ukraine to ensure that any donation would meet its military needs, and we examine the operational effectiveness of the equipment,"" said Daniel Minden in a media statement.

""We are following this same process for the CAF's stock of CRV7 rockets, purchased decades ago. In particular, we are pursuing testing to ensure that this equipment is operationally effective and safe to transport to Ukraine before any potential donation.""

The lack of warheads is a problem.

Cold War weaponry

Supporters of Ukraine have been campaigning online for the donation of the CRV7s and 12 retired army Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) defence systems.

Those supporters have been told that as many as 8,000 of the rockets still have warheads in good condition and could be donated immediately, while the rest could be used for spare parts.

Designed during the Cold War and produced by Bristol Aerospace in Winnipeg, Man., the CRV7 was considered one of the most powerful air-to-ground attack rockets of its time and was still in service with allied nations during the Afghan war.

They can be fired from both fixed-wing warplanes and attack helicopters and come with different kinds of warhead — one of which, the 7.3 kilogram type, is capable of piercing armoured or heavily reinforced targets.

Minden said the rocket donation proposal was an attempt to distract from the fact the Conservatives voted against the updated free trade legislation last year.

The Conservatives objected to a ""carbon tax"" provision in the text, even though there's no obligation on the part of the Ukrainian government to impose such a levy.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

Trudeau invited veteran of Nazi unit to attend Zelenskyy rally in Toronto  CBC.ca,"Yaroslav Hunka, the man at the centre of the controversy surrounding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's September address to Parliament, was also invited by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to attend a Toronto rally honouring Zelenskyy during his visit to Canada.

Hunka was in the gallery during Zelenskyy's address to parliamentarians and received a standing ovation after then-Speaker Anthony Rota acknowledged the Ukrainian-Canadian for fighting the Russians during the Second World War. Media reports later revealed he fought for Nazi Germany.

An invitation obtained through an access to information request, and first reported by Rebel News, was sent to Hunka to attend a rally in Toronto on the day that Zelenskyy addressed Parliament.

The invitation was sent on behalf of Trudeau through the Office of Protocol of Canada.

The Prime Minister's Office confirmed to CBC News on Monday that Hunka was invited to the rally in Toronto, where Zelenskyy met with members of the Canadian-Ukrainian community . It said that Hunka didn't attend.

""Last September, there was a community event with the President of Ukraine in Toronto with over 1,000 people invited. Hundreds of Canadians were invited,"" a statement from the PMO said.

""The individual in question's name was submitted by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. The individual did not attend. Knowing what is known now — the individual shouldn't have been invited.""

CBC News has reached out to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress for comment.

Hunka's invitation to the Toronto event likely will raise new questions about government vetting processes for events featuring foreign dignitaries.

Rota, who invited Hunka to the House to hear Zelenskyy's address, was forced to resign days after Zelenskyy's visit .

Conservatives are placing the blame for the incident squarely on Trudeau and are accusing him of not being truthful about the invitation.

call on Canada to donate rockets to Ukraine — but not all are battle-ready  CBC.ca,"The federal Conservatives are demanding that the Liberal government donate to Ukraine tens of thousands of surplus air-to-ground rockets that are slated for disposal.

Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre issued the call Friday during the House of Commons debate on legislation to update the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement.

The Canadian Armed Forces has a stockpile of 83,303 CRV7 rockets, a 1980s-vintage weapon that was taken out of service in the early 2000s.

Three years ago, the federal government signed a contract to dispose of the rockets over several years.

Poilievre said he understands Ukraine has asked Canada to donate the CRV7s instead of destroying them.

""It's time for less talk and more action,"" Poilievre said in a media statement.

""Instead of making Canadians pay millions of dollars to decommission these weapons,"" he said, the weapons should be given ""to Ukraine who can use them in the defence of sovereignty.""

The Department of National Defence (DND) acknowledged Friday that it still has the rockets and they're being considered as part of a possible future military donation package.

The problem — according to a defence official who spoke on background — is that while Canada still has tens of thousands of the rockets and their motors, not all of them have warheads.

A spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair confirmed the government is considering donating the rockets.

""Before sending equipment to Ukraine, we coordinate closely with Ukraine to ensure that any donation would meet its military needs, and we examine the operational effectiveness of the equipment,"" said Daniel Minden in a media statement.

""We are following this same process for the CAF's stock of CRV7 rockets, purchased decades ago. In particular, we are pursuing testing to ensure that this equipment is operationally effective and safe to transport to Ukraine before any potential donation.""

The lack of warheads is a problem.

Cold War weaponry

Supporters of Ukraine have been campaigning online for the donation of the CRV7s and 12 retired army Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) defence systems.

Those supporters have been told that as many as 8,000 of the rockets still have warheads in good condition and could be donated immediately, while the rest could be used for spare parts.

Designed during the Cold War and produced by Bristol Aerospace in Winnipeg, Man., the CRV7 was considered one of the most powerful air-to-ground attack rockets of its time and was still in service with allied nations during the Afghan war.

They can be fired from both fixed-wing warplanes and attack helicopters and come with different kinds of warhead — one of which, the 7.3 kilogram type, is capable of piercing armoured or heavily reinforced targets.

Minden said the rocket donation proposal was an attempt to distract from the fact the Conservatives voted against the updated free trade legislation last year.

The Conservatives objected to a ""carbon tax"" provision in the text, even though there's no obligation on the part of the Ukrainian government to impose such a levy.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

'superhuman' artificial intelligence looming, Canada needs law now: AI pioneer  CBC News","The federal government must move quickly to regulate artificial intelligence, said a top AI pioneer who warns the technology's current trajectory poses major societal risks

Yoshua Bengio, dubbed a ""godfather"" of AI, told members of Parliament Monday that Ottawa should put a law in place immediately, even if that legislation is not perfect.

The scientific director at Mila, the Quebec AI Institute, said a ""superhuman"" intelligence that is as smart as a human being could be developed within the next two decades — or even the next few years.

""We're not ready,"" Bengio said.

One short-term risk of AI is the use of deepfake videos to spread disinformation, he said. Such videos use AI to make it look as though a public figure is saying something they didn't, or doing something that never happened.

The technology can also be used to interact with people through text or dialogue ""in a way that can fool a social media user and make them change their mind on political questions,"" said Bengio.

""There's real concern about use of AI in politically oriented ways that go against the principles of our democracy.""

A year or two down the road, the worry is that more-advanced systems could be used for cyberattacks.

AI systems are getting better and better at programming.

""When these systems get strong enough to defeat our current cyber defences and our industrial digital infrastructure, we are in trouble,"" Bengio said.

""Especially if these systems fall in the wrong hands.""

Bill proposes to regulate AI systems

The House of Commons industry committee, where Bengio testified Monday, is studying a Liberal government bill that would update privacy law and begin regulating some artificial intelligence systems.

The bill as drafted would give the government time to develop regulations, but Bengio said some provisions should take effect right away.

""With the current approach, it would take something like two years before enforcement (is) possible,"" he said.

One of the initial rules he said he wants to see implemented is a registry that would require systems with a specified level of capability to report to the government.

Bengio said that would put the responsibility and cost of demonstrating safety on large tech companies developing these systems, rather than on taxpayers.

Bill C-27 was first drafted in 2022 to target what are described as ""high-impact"" AI systems.

Bengio said the government should change the legislation's definition of ""high-impact"" to include technology that poses national security and societal threats.

That could include any AI systems that bad actors could use to design dangerous cyberattacks and weapons, or systems that find ways to self-replicate despite programming instructions to the contrary.

Generative AI systems like ChatGPT, which can create text, images and videos, emerged for widespread public use after the bill was first introduced.

The government said it plans to amend the legislation to reflect that.

Liberals say they aim to require companies to take steps ensuring the content they create is identifiable as AI-generated.

Bengio said it's ""very important to cover general-purpose AI systems because they're also the ones that could be the most dangerous if misused.""

Catherine Regis, a professor at the Universite de Montreal, also told the committee meeting Monday that the government needs to act urgently, citing recent ""meteoric developments in AI which we're all familiar with.""

Speaking in French, she pointed out that AI regulation is a global effort and Canada must figure out what to do at the national level if it wants to have a voice.

""Decisions will be taken on a global scale that'll have an impact on all countries,"" she said.

Establishing a clear and solid vision at the Canadian level is ""one of the essential conditions to play a credible structuring and influential role in global governance,"" she said.

Poilievre defends Alberta Premier Smith on transgender policies  CBC News,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre defended Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and her approach to transgender issues Tuesday, saying the Liberal government and the media have demonized her for policies that would give parents more say over their kids.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference on car theft in Montreal, Poilievre said the Liberal government is ""spreading disinformation"" about what Smith has proposed.

""If you keep it vague and you actually refrain from describing the policies Premier Smith is putting in place, you think you can misrepresent them and misrepresent conservatives,"" he said.

""This is exactly what Justin Trudeau has done. You notice Trudeau has not given a single example of any of the policies that Premier Smith has brought forward that he individually disagrees with because he doesn't want to be specific about it. He and you want to peddle disinformation in order to demonize Premier Smith and parents,"" Poilievre added, addressing his comments to the reporter who asked the question.

Poilievre said Trudeau and his ministers need to ""butt out.""

""He should let parents raise kids and let provinces run schools and hospitals,"" he said.

When asked by a reporter if the policies could actually limit the rights of parents who support their child's pursuit of a gender transition, Poilievre said, ""No.""

WATCH: Debate on Alberta's transgender policies 'misrepresents conservatives,' says Poilievre Debate around Alberta's transgender policies 'misrepresents conservatives,' says Poilievre Duration 2:16 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is peddling disinformation in order to 'demonize' Alberta Premier Danielle Smith for her proposed policies on gender-affirming care.

Trudeau last week condemned what he called Smith's ""anti-LGBT policies"" and said such actions will worsen mental health issues and suicidal ideation among young people struggling with gender dysphoria.

Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, a gay man, has been more specific about what the Liberal government opposes.

Referring to proposed policies that would demand that Alberta trans kids aged 15 and under get parental consent to use their preferred names and pronouns in school, Boissonnault said Monday that Smith is intent on ""forcing kids out of the closet before many of them are ready.""

He said a child shouldn't be required to reveal their gender identity to an unsupportive parent.

""She's taking away the safe space for some young people,"" Boissonnault said. ""To ban young LGBTQ2 kids from being who they are puts lives at risk.""

WATCH: Alberta's move on gender-affirming care is 'American-style' politics, Boissonnault says Alberta's move on gender-affirming care is ‘American-style' politics, Boissonnault says Duration 1:07 Alberta Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault spoke out against Alberta's new policy on gender-affirming care and called out Conservatives for not talking about the issue, saying 'silence is complicity.'

Poilievre suggested that the federal government and the media are shying away from talking about Smith's other policies, which deal with sensitive medical decisions that have become a lightning rod for debate in Canada and south of the border.

Smith is promising a ban on so-called ""top"" and ""bottom"" surgeries for minors aged 17 and under, a practice that's very rare in Canada because it goes against the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH)'s standards of care.

Smith also wants to restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for children 15 and under.

The premier has pitched these policies as a way to protect young people who may come to regret having made life-altering decisions in haste.

Smith is also trying to keep trans women and girls out of women's sports, a policy she said is motivated by safety and fairness.

Campaign Life Coalition, a social conservative group, has praised Smith's actions as ""a political miracle"" that will ""go a long way in protecting children.""

WATCH: Premier Smith defends proposed new gender policies during Ottawa visit Premier Smith defends proposed new gender policies during Ottawa visit Duration 2:58 Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, visiting Ottawa to open a new provincial office, says her planned policy changes on gender identity are part of 'a debate that we have to have.'

LGBTQ groups, trans advocates and Alberta's medical association, among many others, have condemned the policies as an infringement on trans people's constitutional rights.

Alberta NDP MP Blake Desjarlais, who is two-spirit, said Smith is ""denying trans kids their basic human rights"" and restricting their access to ""life-saving health care.""

Desjarlais blasted Poilievre and the Conservatives for their stance on the issue. He also urged the federal government to use its powers under the Canada Health Act to withhold health-care funding from Alberta if the province denies access to these services.

Some health-care providers also maintain that limiting blockers and hormones could have consequences for young people suffering from dysphoria.

""This is a direct attack on trans youth,"" said Dr. Ted Jablonski, a Calgary family physician who specializes in transgender care. ""This is an assault on their medical care.

""There's no medical evidence to make any kind of restrictions. We have very good guidelines to manage trans youth.""

The Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS) has said that ""gender-affirming medical interventions may be an important component of comprehensive care"" for some transgender or gender-diverse adolescents.

The CPS, citing past scientific research, has said access to puberty blockers ""has been associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation over the life course.""

It has said these drugs should not be prescribed before the onset of puberty for medical reasons but also because the puberty process is ""an important experience through which young people may develop clearer understanding of their gender identity.""

The CPS says gender-affirming hormone therapy, which it says produces reversible and irreversible changes, should also only be provided to young people who ""demonstrate the capacity to understand and appreciate both the benefits and risks of these medications, given their profound effects.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

Poilievre says minors should not have access to puberty blockers  CBC.ca,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Wednesday he does not support trans kids taking puberty blockers — medicines that are used to pause puberty before a possible gender transition or other interventions, like hormone therapy.

Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill before a Conservative caucus meeting, Poilievre said the decision to pursue transgender treatments should be reserved to adults alone.

""Puberty blockers for minors? I think we should protect children and their ability to make adult decisions when they're adults,"" Poilievre said.

""I think we should protect the rights of parents to make their own decisions with regards to their children.""

Asked to state definitively if he's opposed to puberty blockers for people under the age of 18, Poilievre said he is.

That's a step further than what Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has proposed in her province.

Smith, who announced a series of transgender policies last week, has pitched restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for children 15 and under.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned what he describes as Smith's ""anti-LGBT"" policies, which he said could lead to mental health troubles and an increase in suicidal thoughts among teens.

""The fact that Premier Smith and Pierre Poilievre want government to take away the option for parents and their vulnerable youth — in consultation with their doctors — to make the right decisions for them is anchored in ideology and is not about protecting the most vulnerable,"" Trudeau told reporters Wednesday.

Puberty blockers — hormone-suppressing agents that pause the progression of puberty — are typically prescribed to people in the early stages of puberty to halt unwanted physical changes, such as breast development or facial hair.

They are prescribed to children only after consultation with a doctor.

They may sometimes be combined with hormone therapies, which can have long-term, irreversible effects.

WATCH | Poilievre says he's against puberty blockers for transgender children Poilievre opposes puberty blockers for people people under 18 Duration 2:04 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he does not support puberty blockers for minors. His comment comes after Alberta's government proposed restricting the medical treatment for children under 15.

The Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS) has said that ""gender-affirming medical interventions may be an important component of comprehensive care"" for some transgender or gender-diverse adolescents.

The CPS, citing scientific research, has said access to puberty blockers ""has been associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation over the life course.""

It has said these drugs should not be prescribed before the onset of puberty for medical reasons — and also because the puberty process is ""an important experience through which young people may develop clearer understanding of their gender identity.""

Cross-sex hormone therapy is a treatment used by trans people to transition and to look physically more like the gender with which they identify.

Trans men, for example, can take testosterone to help deepen their voices, increase muscle mass and promote body and facial hair.

Trans women sometimes use estrogen to increase breast size, reduce male-pattern baldness and reduce testicle size.

The CPS says hormone therapy produces both reversible and irreversible changes and should only be provided to young people who ""demonstrate the capacity to understand and appreciate both the benefits and risks of these medications, given their profound effects.""

Poilievre said he thinks adults with gender dysphoria should ""have the freedom to make any decision they want about their bodies.""

While the national conversation about trans care was prompted by Smith's policy announcement, Poilievre said Trudeau is to blame for whipping up the public and the media.

Poilievre called trans health care ""a divisive wedge"" that's being used by the Liberal government to ""distract from doubling housing costs and quadrupling carbon taxes.""

""Justin Trudeau is puffing out his chest, trying to divide Canadians and attack parents who are trying to protect their kids,"" he said.

Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, a gay man who has become a vocal critic of Smith's plan, has spoken out about Alberta's push to demand that some trans kids get parental consent before using their preferred names and pronouns at school.

Boissonnault told reporters Wednesday that neither Poilievre nor Smith should have a say in who should have access to certain treatments.

""That's a conversation that should take place between a young person and their doctor,"" he said. ""I don't see MD after Pierre Poilievre's name or Danielle Smith's, so [it's] not their business.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh accused Poilievre and Smith of ""attacking vulnerable communities.""

Charles's planned visit to Canada delayed after cancer diagnosis  CBC.ca,"Plans for King Charles III's first tour of Canada as head of state are on hold following his cancer diagnosis, CBC News has learned.

Although the visit was never confirmed officially by Buckingham Palace, Canadian government sources told CBC News King Charles III and Queen Camilla were set to visit in May 2024. The planned tour a lso has been reported on by British media .

Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace said medical staff found a form of cancer when the 75-year-old King went through a hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, and said he had commenced a schedule of regular treatments.

In the statement, the Palace didn't specify the type of cancer detected or the treatment the King is receiving. It said the King ""remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.""

In a response to a CBC News access to information request, a Canadian official wrote that ""following the announcement of a cancer diagnosis for His Majesty the King, there are no more tours planned in Canada for 2024, nor are there any tours planned with other members of the Royal Family.""

Sources who are not authorized to speak publicly have told CBC News that planning for the royal visit has been postponed.

Buckingham Palace did not respond to a request for comment.

Because no tours were announced publicly, the Royal Family won't have to cancel anything publicly, said royal commentator and author Victoria Murphy.

""There's no doubt there were things in the planning discussions behind the scenes that have now been paused because of this diagnosis,"" she said in an interview with CBC News on Monday.

The King, who was crowned last May, hasn't travelled to many Commonwealth countries since his coronation.

As King, he has travelled to Germany, Romania, France, Kenya and, most recently, the United Arab Emirates for the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

""I would've expected that this year, the king would've done, in normal circumstances, quite a bit of overseas travels,"" said Murphy. ""Everything has shifted now because of this diagnosis.""

His last trip to Canada was in May 2022, when he visited Newfoundland, Ottawa and the Northwest Territories. During that visit, then-Assembly of First Nations national chief RoseAnne Archibald called on the Queen to apologize for the Crown's ""ongoing failure to fulfil its treaty agreements"" with Indigenous peoples.

Archibald told reporters that Charles listened to the request and was "" very empathetic .""

Canada divided over cutting ties with the Crown

A poll conducted shortly before the King's coronation showed Canadians are divided about whether the country should remain tied to the Crown.

A Leger survey of 1,544 Canadians found 56 per cent of respondents agreed the country should ""reconsider its ties"" to the monarchy now that there's a new sovereign.

It also found that 67 per cent of respondents felt ""indifferent"" to Charles's new role. Only 12 per cent said it's ""good news.""

About 80 per cent of respondents said they're not ""personally attached"" to the monarchy.

Any changes to Canada's ties to the monarchy would require a unanimous decision of the provinces, the House of Commons and the Senate — and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said there's no appetite for a debate about scrapping the monarchy.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

uses Tucker Carlson interview to take shots at Zelenskyy over Yaroslav Hunka affair  CBC.ca,"Russian President Vladimir Putin used an interview with U.S. media personality Tucker Carlson to take a shot at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for joining in a standing ovation for a veteran of a Second World War Nazi unit during his visit to Canada.

Zelenskyy gave an address to Parliament during the September visit. He was introduced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and thanked by then-Speaker of the House Anthony Rota.

During his remarks, Rota recognized a man from his riding, Yaroslav Hunka, and praised the Ukrainian Canadian for fighting the Russians during the Second World War. Zelenskyy, Trudeau and the rest of the House rose to applaud Hunka.

Media reports later revealed that Hunka fought with the Waffen-SS Galicia Division, also known as the SS 14th Waffen Division and sometimes the First Ukrainian Division. The unit was made up of Ukrainian volunteers from Galicia and was under Nazi command.

""The president of Ukraine stood up with the entire Parliament of Canada and applauded this man. How can this be imagined?"" Putin told Carlson through a translator. Carlson posted the interview on X, formerly Twitter.

While historians say men joined the unit for a variety of reasons — including a desire to fight for Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union — the incident was a major diplomatic embarrassment for Canada.

Putin has repeatedly claimed he is waging war on Ukraine in order to ""de-Nazify"" the country and has jumped on the Hunka affair to justify his argument in the past.

Western allies, including Canada, have consistently pushed back against those claims, calling Russia's full-scale invasion a blatant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.

Hundreds of thousands have died and millions have fled Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly two years ago. Russian forces have also abducted Ukrainian children; some estimates of the number of children taken range in the thousands.

During the interview, Putin suggested that the Hunka affair is ""being silenced in Western countries,"" despite extensive media coverage of the incident last fall.

The Russian president has greatly limited his contact with international media since he launched the full-scale war in Ukraine in February 2022.

Western journalists were invited to Putin's annual press conference in December — the first since the war began — but only two were given the chance to ask a question.

Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Carlson was chosen for the interview because ""he has a position which differs"" from other English-language media.

Before his exit from Fox News, Carlson repeatedly questioned the validity of U.S. support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion and speculated about why Americans are told to hate Putin so much. His commentaries were frequently circulated on Russian state-run media.

WATCH | Putin takes shots at Zelenskyy over Yaroslav Hunka affair Putin takes shots at Zelenskyy over Yaroslav Hunka affair Duration 4:29 Russian President Vladimir Putin used an interview with U.S. media personality Tucker Carlson to take a shot at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for joining in a standing ovation for a veteran of a Second World War Nazi unit during his visit to Canada.

Carlson's trip comes as he aligns himself with former U.S. president Donald Trump in a growing split in the Republican party over Putin and the Ukraine war. Trump has pushed to cut off aid to Ukraine, and the GOP majority controlling the House of Representatives has so far complied.

The U.S. has sent Ukraine more than $110 billion US in aid since Russia invaded in February 2022.

Putin's stance on wider war in Europe

Putin, speaking in Russian with his words dubbed into English, made lengthy remarks about Russia's relations with Ukraine, Poland and other countries during the interview, which was more than two hours long.

He said he had no interest in expanding its war in Ukraine to other countries such as Poland and Latvia.

Asked if he could imagine a scenario in which he would send Russian troops to Poland, a NATO member. Putin replied: ""Only in one case, if Poland attacks Russia. Why? Because we have no interest in Poland, Latvia or anywhere else. Why would we do that? We simply don't have any interest.""

Putin, who will be seeking a fifth term as president in this year's election, said Western leaders had come to realize it was impossible inflict a strategic defeat on Russia and were wondering what to do next.

""We are ready for this dialogue,"" he said.

Putin devoted a substantial part of the interview to complaining that Ukraine had been on the verge of agreeing a deal to end hostilities at talks in Istanbul in April 2022, but backed away, he said, once Russian troops withdrew from near Kyiv.

WATCH | Vladimir Putin says Russia will intensify attacks on Ukaine: Putin vows to intensify attacks on Ukraine Duration 2:03 Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to intensify attacks on Ukraine after some of the most intense aerial bombardments of the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to Western allies about air defence and supplies.

""Well now let them think how to reverse the situation,"" he said. ""We're not against it. It would be funny if it were not so sad … this endless mobilization in Ukraine, the hysteria, the domestic problems, sooner or later it will result in an agreement.""

The Russian leader said the U.S. had pressing domestic issues to worry about.

""Wouldn't it be better to negotiate with Russia? Make an agreement. Already understanding the situation that is developing today, realizing that Russia will fight for its interests to the end,"" Putin said.

Washington has made clear it has no interest in talking on Putin's terms.

Matt Galloway talks to President of the Angus Reid Institute Shachi Kurl, the Toronto Star's Stephanie Levitz, and the National Post’s Ryan Tumilty.

U.S. journalist's release possible

Putin told Carlson that it might be possible to free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is awaiting trial on spying charges, in exchange for a Russian prisoner.

He said Russian and American special services were discussing the case and had made some progress.

The Russian president suggested that in return, Moscow wanted Germany to free Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a Chechen dissident in Berlin.

Gershkovich was arrested on March 29, 2023 in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and accused of trying to obtain defence secrets. He and his newspaper strongly reject the charges and the U.S. government has designated him as wrongfully detained.

Russia and the United States have agreed high-profile prisoner swaps in the past — most recently in December 2022, when Moscow traded Brittney Griner, a U.S. basketball star convicted of a drugs offence in Russia, for Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout.

Putin, without mentioning Krasikov by name, referred to a person who ""due to patriotic sentiments, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals.""

Last month a Moscow court extended Gershkovich's custody by two months. Putin said the reporter had been ""caught red handed when he was secretly getting confidential information.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

of Commons passes new Ukraine free trade deal over Conservative opposition  CBC.ca,"The House of Commons passed an updated free trade agreement with Ukraine on Tuesday over the objections of Conservative MPs, who have attacked the bill for containing a reference to ""carbon pricing.""

The legislation passed with support from the Liberals, Bloc Québécois and NDP. It will now go to the Senate for review.

The trade deal has become a political flashpoint in recent months after Conservatives accused the Liberal government of forcing ""carbon pricing"" provisions into the bill.

The Liberals in turn have accused the Conservatives of abandoning Ukraine. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took a shot at Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre ahead of Tuesday's vote.

""He is choosing to not stand with Ukraine, not stand with Ukrainians, and not stand with Ukrainian Canadians,"" Trudeau said during question period.

Poilievre, whose party has maintained a large polling lead over Trudeau's Liberals for months, has said his party still supports Ukraine and that his only objection is to the carbon pricing provision.

WATCH | Poilievre says Trudeau is a 'big talker' on Ukraine: Poilievre says Trudeau is a 'big talker' on Ukraine Duration 1:35 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre blasted the prime minister's record on Ukraine and talked about his own plans to make Canadian natural gas available to Europe.

Conservative House leader Andrew Scheer told reporters before Tuesday's vote that his party can't support the bill as long as it contains references to carbon pricing.

""In order for this trade deal to be implemented, Ukraine must agree to promote a carbon tax. That is not something we can support,"" he said.

The trade agreement imposes no such obligation on the Ukrainian government to introduce a carbon tax. It does include a provision saying the two countries will cooperate to ""promote carbon pricing and measures to mitigate carbon leakage risks.""

Ukraine has had a carbon tax in place since 2011 and is actively seeking membership in the European Union, which has had an emissions trading system since 2005 .

But Scheer suggested that the wording would prevent Ukraine from repealing their carbon tax in the future.

""Should Ukrainians ever decide to make a different choice, it would be in violation of a trade deal,"" he said.

The Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC) welcomed the bill's passage but lamented the lack of unanimous support in the House of Commons.

""We thank members of Parliament who supported this important piece of legislation. We are disappointed that the vote in favour of the bill was not unanimous,"" UCC president Alexandra Chyczij said in a media statement.

Zenon Potoczny, president of the Canada-Ukraine Chamber of Commerce, told CBC News Network's Power & Politics he also was disappointed the vote wasn't unanimous.

""At a time when there's a horrendous war — people dying, children being kidnapped and taken to Russia — I think it's time to stop the politics,"" Potoczny told host David Cochrane.

The vote came on the same day a poll was released that suggests support for Ukraine is waning among a growing number of Canadians — particularly Conservative voters.

The survey, conducted by the Angus Reid Institute, says a quarter of Canadians believe Canada is offering ""too much support"" to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, up from 13 per cent who said the same thing in May 2022.

The percentage of Canadians who voted for the Conservative Party in the last election, and who now say Canada is doing too much to assist Ukraine, has more than doubled — from 19 per cent in May 2022 to 43 per cent now.

Russian pleads guilty to exporting technology to Russia  CBC.ca,"A Canadian Russian woman has pleaded guilty for her role in a multimillion-dollar scheme to send electronics to Russia for military use in the war against Ukraine.

Kristina Puzyreva, who has lived in Montreal, pleaded guilty in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., to money-laundering conspiracy for helping to send pieces used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and guided missile systems in violation of export and sanctions laws, according to a statement from American prosecutors on Monday.

Puzyreva, 32, her husband, Nikolay Goltsev, 37, and Salimdzhon Nasriddinov, 52, were each charged last fall with smuggling, conspiracy to violate sanctions and wire fraud conspiracy.

The court filings alleged Puzyreva, Goltsev and Nasriddinov were working with four unnamed co-conspirators based in Russia who work for major electronics companies that supply components to the Russian military.

The cases against Goltsev and Nasriddinov are ongoing, authorities said Monday.

Couple operated out of Montreal, records show

An indictment filed in November said Goltsev bought American electronic components for the Russian military for years while living in Canada.

Breon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said Puzyreva was ""a key part of the plan, laundering proceeds from the scheme to evade sanctions and ship UAV and missile components to Russia that were later found on the battlefield in Ukraine.""

Puzyreva did business through an electronics company based in Montreal, Simatech Group Inc., which also bought what's known as dual-use technology — tech that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.

She received more than 150 packages at her Canadian address from American companies over roughly five years, prosecutors said.

Court records said Goltsev ""served as an account manager and purchasing co-ordinator for Electronic Network, Inc.,"" another Montreal-based company, which is under sanction by both the U.S. and Canadian governments.

U.S. authorities said the scheme began in January 2022 and eventually involved more than 300 illegal shipments valued at about $10 million.

Some of the electronics were later recovered from helicopters, missiles, tanks and other Russian equipment that had been seized in Ukraine, they added.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

officials still haven't seen intelligence linking UN's Gaza aid agency with Hamas: sources  CBC.ca,"The government of Canada did not see any evidence backing up Israel's claim that staff employed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) colluded with Hamas before suspending funding to the agency, CBC News has learned.

Government sources tell CBC that Israel still has not shared evidence with Canada to substantiate its claim that 12 employees of UNRWA were involved in some capacity in the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas and the affiliated group Islamic Jihad.

Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel on Oct. 7 during Hamas-led attacks, including several Canadians; Israeli officials said 253 others were taken hostage, with about 130 yet to return home. Palestinian officials say more than 27,000 people have been killed in the Israeli military response to the Hamas-led attacks.

Britain's Channel Four News earlier this week obtained a copy of a dossier that the government of Israel shared with the U.K. government, which also cut funding to UNRWA.

Channel Four reported that the dossier was only six pages long. The news service said it rehashes long-standing Israeli government complaints about UNRWA and alleges the involvement of UNRWA staff in the Oct 7 attack, but ""provides no evidence"" to back up Israel's explosive allegations against the agency.

Britain's Sky News also reviewed the dossier and reached a similar conclusion:

""The Israeli intelligence documents make several claims that Sky News has not seen proof of and many of the claims, even if true, do not directly implicate UNRWA,"" the news channel reported.

CBC News has not yet been able to review the Israeli intelligence document.

Channel Four quoted from relevant sections of the document, which is in Hebrew.

""From intelligence information, documents and identity cards seized during the course of the fighting, it is now possible to flag around 190 Hamas and PIJ (Palestinian Islamic Jihad) terrorist operatives who serve as UNRWA employees. More than 10 UNRWA staffers took apart in the events of October 7,"" the paper says.

The report includes photographs of 12 UNRWA employees it claims were involved, but does not provide the information or documents it mentions to substantiate those claims, Channel Four reported.

French public broadcaster France 24 also had access to the Israeli report, which it compared to the notorious ""dodgy dossier"" of intelligence claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction that led the U.K. government to join the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Israel refuses to provide proof

Israel has refused to provide the intelligence it says backs up its allegations, either to UNRWA or to the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), the UN body assigned to investigate.

""I don't think we need to give intelligence information. This would reveal sources in the operation,"" Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for Israel's foreign ministry, told France 24.

That statement appeared to contradict a tweet by Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Monday which pledged that Israel ""will submit all evidence highlighting UNRWA's ties to terrorism and its harmful effects on regional stability.""

UNRWA moved quickly to fire 12 individual staff members on January 26, as soon as Israel made its allegations.

""To protect the Agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay,"" said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general.

""Any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution.""

UNRWA blindsided by sudden cutoff

UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma said the agency acted to fire the staff immediately because of the seriousness and timing of the allegations — not because it had credible evidence against them.

""The commissioner-general of UNRWA did this in the best interests of the agency, due to the huge risks both to the reputation of the agency and also the largest humanitarian operation in response to the Gaza war,"" she told Channel Four News.

She said the firings were intended to reassure donor nations and forestall drastic actions.

The U.S. responded to the allegations by cutting funding immediately, although U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged that it was relying on Israel's word alone.

""We haven't had the ability to investigate [the allegations] ourselves,"" Blinken said on Jan. 30. ""But they are highly, highly credible.""

Canada announced the suspension of all funding within hours of the U.S. announcement.

WATCH: Displaced Gazans worry about UNRWA's future Displaced Gazans worried over UNRWA funding pause Duration 1:38 After 13 of UNRWA's staff were accused of being involved in Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks against Israel, several nations have paused sending financial aid to the agency, which has displaced Gazans concerned about where they'll be getting their medication or next meal if UNRWA lacks the funding to continue operations.

""I don't think any of us has anticipated this huge number of our friendly donors, who have been our partners for decades on end, to suspend the funding so, so quickly, like they've done,"" said Touma.

""I also think none of us have anticipated that this would be done in the middle of a war, and to the largest humanitarian organization, who's responding to what has become very quickly one of the most complex and difficult humanitarian crises in the world.""

Unless funding is restored within the next few weeks, she said, the agency will struggle even harder to deal with the famine conditions now prevailing in the Gaza Strip.

""We're going to be forced to make very tough decisions that humanitarian aid workers are not supposed to,"" she said.

Canadian officials told CBC News that Canada's own decision to defund was a reaction to UNRWA's decision to dismiss the staffers, which created the impression that the agency saw Israel's allegation as credible.

Splits within Israel

Israel's decision to go public with its allegations has caused friction between the Netanyahu government and the Israeli military, which has initiated an investigation to find the sources of the leak, according to Israeli media reports.

Israeli media outlets have reported commanders in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) want UNRWA's operations to continue because they fear being left with sole responsibility for a territory gripped by famine.

Israel's civilian government has been pushing for the elimination of the agency for some time.

""It's time that the international community and the UN itself understand that UNRWA's mission has to end,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a visiting UN delegation on Jan. 31. ""UNRWA is self-perpetuating. It is self-perpetuating also in its desire to keep alive the Palestinian refugee issue.""

""UNRWA employees participated in the massacre of October 7,"" foreign minister Israel Katz wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Lazzarini should draw conclusions and resign. Supporters of terrorism are not welcome here.""

Touma pointed out that the Israeli government itself signs off on every employee hired by UNRWA.

""Every year we send a list of all our staff working across the region to the host governments,"" she said. ""And we have not received a response to the contents of that list from the government of Israel.""

Touma said she believes the names of the dozen employees accused by Israel were all on the list provided to the Israeli government in 2023.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

Canada forgets her wheelchair  CBC News,"Canada's chief accessibility officer is taking airlines to task for failing to treat wheelchair users with respect after Air Canada forgot last week to bring her wheelchair on a cross-country flight.

Stephanie Cadieux said that when she flew from Toronto to Vancouver on Friday, she discovered that her wheelchair had been left behind.

She posted about the incident on X, formerly Twitter. Her posting received overwhelming support — almost 650 retweets and more than 2,500 likes.

""This was immensely frustrating and dehumanizing — and I was furious,"" she later said in a post on her LinkedIn account . ""The tweet has been widely viewed and shared. Air Canada responded and my chair has been returned to me.""

A statement from Air Canada said the chair was returned Saturday morning.

Cadieux said that while her chair was swiftly and safely returned to her by the airline, her ""job title as chief accessibility officer should not influence the experience"" she has when she flies.

Well. <a href=""https://twitter.com/AirCanada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@AirCanada</a> left my chair in Toronto. I’m now without my essential equipment. Independence taken away. I’m furious. Unacceptable. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/RightsOnFlights?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#RightsOnFlights</a> <a href=""https://t.co/h1WPUwlgxw"">pic.twitter.com/h1WPUwlgxw</a> —@Stephanie4BC

""While I'm glad I've been able to draw attention to this issue, I don't want the continued focus to be on my experience,"" she said.

""Not surprisingly to me, many of the responses to my tweet were from people sharing that the same thing had happened to them, with no quick resolution.""

Cadieux said everyone who uses an airline should get the same level of service, regardless of job title.

Airlines have to do better: Cadieux

Cadieux said she travels a lot for work and over the past year her wheelchair has been damaged in transit several times.

""I've heard and continue to hear countless stories about lost or severely damaged chairs and enough is enough,"" she said.

Cadieux said airlines do not provide appropriate care and attention to essential equipment like wheelchairs, and leave disabled travellers to fight alone when things go wrong.

""I want everyone to understand that when a person's wheelchair is lost, so is their independence, safety, mobility and dignity,"" she said. ""Airlines have to take responsibility and they have to do better.""

Federal Minister of Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities Kamal Khera said on social media the situation ""is completely unacceptable.""

""Persons with disabilities deserve equal rights and access while boarding planes or using public transit,"" she said.

An Air Canada statement emailed to CBC News said the airline has apologized to Cadieux and the company recognizes ""mobility devices are vital to their users""

Air Canada says it's working to improve accessibility

""As part of our investigation into how this serious service lapse occurred, we are also looking for additional measures we can implement to prevent such situations in the future,"" the statement said.

The statement said the airline carries more than 700,000 travellers requiring wheelchairs or mobility devices in a normal year and ""the vast, vast majority … travelled without issue.""

The airline said that in the summer, it began rolling out a three-year accessibility plan for customers and employees. Under the plan, the airline is creating an advisory panel of customers with disabilities and is purchasing equipment to improve accessibility.

""We know, particularly as technology and societal expectations change, that our policies must continually evolve and we are fully committed to further refining our approach, including through training, to better support customers requiring mobility assistance and to increase accessibility,"" the airline said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

$100M in 'historic' action plan for 2SLGBT communities  CBC News,"The federal government unveiled what it described as a historic first on Sunday as it announced a five-year, $100-million plan to support 2SLGBT communities across the country.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled the strategy, dubbed ""Canada's first Federal 2SLGBTQI+ Action Plan,"" at a news conference on Sunday ahead of the Pride parade in Ottawa — the first in-person march after a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19.

Trudeau touted the plan as the first such federal initiative of its kind, and said it demonstrates the government's commitment to fighting discrimination and supporting diversity.

""This will guide our ongoing work to fight discrimination, break down barriers, to advance rights and to build a future where everyone in Canada is truly free to be who they are and love whom they love,"" Trudeau said on Sunday.

Trudeau said 75 per cent of the funding will go toward community organizations focused on diversity and inclusion because that's ""where the real work of support comes from.""

""The strength and resilience of your communities should inspire everyone,"" he said.

The federal government previously announced in this year's budget that it would earmark $100 million to benefit 2SLGBT people. The action plan included details of where the money would go.

More than $5 million of the funding will go toward the launch of a public awareness campaign, while $7.7 million has been earmarked for data collection and community led policy research to support federal action on 2SLGBT issues.

Further action on conversion therapy possible

Debbie Owusu-Akyeeah, executive director of the Canadian Centre for Gender & Sexual Diversity, said the strategy was ""long awaited and overdue,"" adding more supports are needed including in schools.

She said Canada has lagged behind many other countries, such as the U.K., Ireland and the Netherlands, which already have government action plans.

She said figures from Statistics Canada have shown a sharp rise in hate crimes toward people from the 2SLGBT communities.

Trudeau signalled the government would look at ""further protections and support"" for people who survived conversion therapy, which he called ""a cruel and dangerous practice"" and which was criminalized earlier this year in Canada.

The federal government is facing calls to tighten the ban to cover practices designed to try to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity offered online from abroad, including the United States.

Wisdom2Action executive director Fae Johnstone, who attended the launch, said there was a need to invest in mental-health counselling for people traumatized by the discredited practice.

""Tens of thousands of people were subjected to it and it's still happening today,"" Johnstone said.

The federal government also signalled that it will look at further legislative changes as part of its action plan. It plans to launch a public consultation on whether to make it illegal to perform cosmetic surgery on intersex children's genitals until they are mature enough to give consent.

The strategy proposes to adopt and encourage the use of the 2SLGBTQI+ acronym, ""which is more inclusive and places the experiences of Indigenous 2SLGBTQI+ communities at the foreground as the first 2SLGBTQI+ peoples in North America.""

The acronym stands for two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and additional sexually and gender diverse people.

More direct support needed, groups told government

Marci Ien, minister of women and gender equality, welcomed the action plan alongside Trudeau, saying the funds are for ""all of those people who are fighting to be heard and accepted.""

""This is for the people who were discarded by their family and friends after they came out, to everybody trying to live their truth in rural communities where they feel isolated. This is for the Black queer people who are fighting every day to justify their place in this country, and the trans women who are afraid sometimes to walk home alone in the dark, this is for you,"" Ien said.

She said the strategy was created following several years of consultation and research with members of the 2SLGBT communities.

Ottawa received more than 25,000 responses in 2020-2021 to a national online survey on how to better serve diverse communities, Ien said.

""The resounding answer was that they needed more direct support ... to offer programs to continue educating the wider public because, again, we can't legislate kindness,"" Ien said.

Effort to get military records continues

The plan pledges to invest up to $10 million per year in 2SLGBT projects abroad.

Trudeau said Canada had welcomed thousands of people from 2SLGBT communities fleeing discrimination abroad and warned of ""rights moving backwards in many parts of the world — some closer than we would like to admit.""

WATCH | Police say attack on Vancouver man during Pride week motivated by hate: Ottawa unveils plan to support 2SLGBT communities Duration 2:01 The federal government has announced $100 million dollars over five years to help 2SLGBT communities across the country. The announcement was made the same day police in Vancouver released video showing the assault of a man following Pride events earlier in the summer.

Michelle Douglas, who won a landmark legal challenge against the Canadian Armed Forces over discrimination against 2SLGBTQ service members, said there was still much work to do to stamp out such practices.

Douglas, a former member of the military police who was honourably discharged in 1989 as part of a ""purge"" of members of the 2SLGBT community, said she also wanted all the records relating to policies toward 2SLGBT personnel released.

""We have about 10,000 pages and we know there are more,"" she said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

latest moves could bottle up much of Russia's naval power  CBC News,"Since midnight Wednesday, Moscow time, Russia has been warning the world that any ship approaching a Ukrainian port ""will be regarded as potential carriers of military cargo.""

This obvious threat to sink commercial shipping appears to be an attempt to prevent ships from taking on Ukrainian grain. This week, Russia unilaterally ended talks on renewing the Black Sea Grain Initiative that has allowed food to flow to other countries from Ukraine, despite the war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked Turkey to join him in a new arrangement to protect grain ships without Russia's involvement. Turkey has yet to respond.

The threat to sink commercial shipping marks an escalation that can only be carried out under a state of declared war, said Tanya Grodzinski, a naval historian at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ont. That's something Russian President Vladimir Putin has been anxious to avoid, opting instead to present his war on Ukraine as a ""special military operation.""

The new threat may say more about Russia's weakness than its strength, as the strategic balance in the waters around European Russia shifts against it.

The day the NATO summit in Vilnius opened — July 11 — was marked in Cuba by the arrival of the Russian Navy warship Perekop of the Baltic Fleet.

The Cuban government welcomed the Perekop — the biggest Russian warship to visit Cuba in many years — with a cannon salute from Havana's old fort.

For Moscow, the visit allowed Russia to project its military power into the Americas and show support for the Cuban Communist Party, a close ally, on the second anniversary of a popular revolt against its rule.

But as the fanfare unfolded in Havana, events in Vilnius that morning and the night before were building a new fence around the Perekop's home ports of St Petersburg and Kaliningrad. Russia's Baltic fleet will still be able to sail in peacetime but it's being strategically bottled up as its home sea becomes a NATO lake.

And to the south, Russia's storied Black Sea fleet, already hurt by the humiliating loss of its flagship Moskva, faces an uncertain future and the possible loss of both its bases and its naval supremacy.

One way in, one way out

The Baltic and the Black Sea share a geographical feature: they both have only one slender opening into the world's oceans.

In the Baltic, three narrow straits separate Denmark from Sweden; the widest, between two Danish islands, is a mere 16 kilometres across.

Ships seeking to exit the Black Sea to enter the Mediterranean must sail the Bosphorus River and the Dardanelles Strait — both of which are entirely within the territorial waters of NATO member Turkey.

Four days after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Turkey closed the straits to all warships, a move that principally affects Russia.

For those reasons, Russia has long preferred to station the main part of its blue water navy and its nuclear submarines at its Arctic and Pacific ports.

Grodzinski said the Baltic and Black Sea fleets were central to Russia's emergence as a great power after the 1790s. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and NATO's response to it, threatens that standing, she added.

""If this was viewed as a gamble on the part of Mr. Putin to recreate this image he has of Russia, this historic image of Russian being a great power, it's being thwarted diplomatically in the Baltic and militarily in Ukraine and the Black Sea,"" she told CBC News.

""The implications for his leadership and position could be quite significant.""

A Baltic ringed by NATO

Putin and his defenders have claimed he launched his war to keep NATO away from Russia's borders. Instead, the conflict triggered a new round of NATO expansion that this year caused Russia's border with the alliance to more than double in length. The accession of Finland in April added more than 1,300 kilometres of NATO-Russia border.

The green light for Sweden to join the alliance, which came on the eve of the Vilnius summit, turns the Baltic Sea into NATO's backyard.

WATCH | NATO countries pledge weapons, training to Ukraine: Ukraine secures weapons, training from G7 and NATO countries Duration 2:06 Canada, Japan, the U.S. and other NATO countries have pledged weapons and training as part of security guarantees to Ukraine. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it is meant to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that Canada supports Ukraine and will continue to do so.

At the start of the year, the northern shores of the Baltic, including both sides of the Gulf of Bothnia, were neutral territory. Sweden and Finland, two countries that maintain highly professional navies and air forces, had for decades remained outside of the European alliance.

Now, every inch of Baltic shoreline outside of Russian waters is controlled by NATO allies — allies that are increasingly well-armed.

""You're seeing this rejuvenation of naval forces all across Europe,"" said Grodzinski. ""Sweden, Norway, Finland and so forth are expanding their navies. There is a greater NATO presence in in the Baltic Sea, which never really occurred before. So there's a completely different dynamic.""

The Swedes, said retired Canadian admiral Mark Norman, ""have an incredibly capable military with some very advanced technologies, many of which are homegrown or organic capabilities. They are experts in what I would call sea control in relatively shallow waters.

""They're experts in mining, counter-mining. They are experts in submarining and in anti-submarining. These are vital capabilities.""

A Russian ship leaving Saint Petersburg must first sail through the Gulf of Finland, where only about 80 kilometres of open water separate Helsinki from the Estonian capital Tallinn. NATO is now on both sides of that narrow strait. The even narrower corridor of international waters in the middle is within easy range of NATO's sea-skimming missiles from either shore.

Arctic alternative far from ideal

The new political geography of the region means ""in effect, in any form of conflict, the Baltic gets cut off,"" said maritime and arctic security expert Rob Huebert of the University of Calgary.

""We're not going to be able to see any real movement from the Russians in any capacity because the forces that the Nordic countries, combined with the Americans, bring into the region now mean that point of departure simply will not exist for the Russians.

""The Russian ability to move any naval assets now is increasingly being limited to off the Kola Peninsula as a result of both what's happening with the Black Sea and what is happening with the Baltic Sea.""

Huebert was referring to Russia's Arctic bases, such as Murmansk, where it bases nuclear submarines and much of its strategic nuclear missile force.

During the Second World War, with the Baltic in German hands, Murmansk and the White Sea port Archangel were the destinations for convoys that delivered four million tonnes of western lend-lease material to help the Soviet war effort.

The difficult local sea and ice conditions were notorious then and remain a challenge today, said Huebert.

""Climate change of course is opening it up, but it's still a limited amount of openness at this point in time,"" he said. ""You still need to have icebreakers to get through. And we see this every year, when the Russians are trying to encourage more shipping through the northern sea route and we're still seeing ships getting stuck.""

Turkey a rising naval power

Russia's other major fleet is based at Vladivostok in the Pacific. Like the Kola Peninsula, Vladivostok is a long way from some of the areas where Russia wants to project power, and also a long way from Russia's own centres of population.

Russia's Baltic problem is the result of a change of heart in NATO member Turkey that also affects the Black Sea, where Turkey controls the lion's share of the coast.

Turkey's navy has also been going through a major upgrade, while Russia's Black Sea fleet has suffered losses during the war with Ukraine — including the embarrassing loss of the Moskva, sunk by a Ukrainian missile.

""Whatever the price of Turkey for allowing Sweden to come in, we suspect that they will probably be playing a more active role in NATO,"" said Huebert.

Even after the invasion of Ukraine, he said, Ankara seemed to be looking for ways to draw closer to Russia. No longer.

""The suspicion is that some type of agreement was reached, with the terms not publicly released,"" said Huebert.

Turkey could have received assurances on its eventual EU membership, for example, or its desire to purchase F-16 fighter jets from the U.S., or other issues that have plagued its relations with Western allies.

""We may never know exactly what's changed Erdogan's mind here,"" said Norman, ""but Turkey has had a change of heart and that is good for NATO.""

A safe harbour no longer

The other major threat to Russia's Black Sea fleet is, of course, Ukraine.

Ever since its founding by Prince Potemkin in 1783, the Black Sea fleet's home port has been Sevastopol in Crimea. Ukraine allowed Russia to continue to operate its bases there after the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 2014, Russia annexed the peninsula anyway.

The recapture of Crimea is now a Ukrainian war goal. But until very recently, Sevastopol had been mostly out of range of Ukrainian weapons.

That has changed as the front has crept south and new weapons have arrived from Ukraine's allies.

Ukraine's acquisition of British Storm Shadow and French SCALP missiles (essentially the same weapon) brings the entire Crimean peninsula within range. The U.S. is currently considering providing ATACMS ballistic missiles, which have an even longer range.

""It severely hampers [the Russians'] freedom of manoeuvre,"" said Norman.

It also makes the port of Sevastopol fundamentally unsafe for Russian warships.

""That has enormous operational implications,"" Norman said. ""It's a well-established doctrine in naval affairs that the best place to take out any naval asset is alongside, before it goes to sea.

""The safest place for them to be is not to be in port. It's harder to hit a moving target.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

Johnston resigning as special rapporteur on foreign interference  CBC News,"David Johnston — tasked by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau back in March with looking into allegations that China tried to meddle in the past two federal elections — says he has decided to step down from that role.

In a resignation letter sent to Trudeau, Johnston said his role has become too muddled in political controversy for him to continue.

""When I undertook the task of independent special rapporteur on foreign interference, my objective was to help build trust in our democratic institutions,"" the former governor general wrote.

""I have concluded that, given the highly partisan atmosphere around my appointment and work, my leadership has had the opposite effect.""

A government source said Johnston made his own decision to resign and wasn't asked to step down by the Prime Minister's Office.

Since his appointment, Johnston has been accused of being unfit for the job because of his personal connections to Trudeau.

The leaders of the Conservative and Bloc Québécois parties have both said Trudeau and Johnston are self-declared friends and their longstanding ties are too close to allow Johnston to judge the prime minister's actions.

Johnston has said that while he was friends with Pierre Trudeau and skied with the Trudeau family back when Justin Trudeau and his brothers were children, he hasn't had any meetings, dinners or personal contacts with Trudeau in the past 40 years.

WATCH | Johnston says he doesn't regret taking on role

David Johnston says he doesn't regret taking on foreign interference assignment Duration 0:23 'When you're asked to serve your country, you do so,"" Johnston says in an exclusive interview with Power and Politics host David Cochrane.

That didn't stop opposition parties from questioning Johnston's investigation of foreign interference. Even the NDP — which currently has a supply-and-confidence deal with the governing Liberals — put forward a motion in the House calling on Johnston to step aside because of an ""appearance of bias."" The motion passed with Conservative and Bloc support.

At the time, Johnston said he planned to stay on until his mandate was complete.

In his initial report released last month, Johnston recommended against calling a public inquiry on foreign interference — despite opposition parties and diaspora groups calling for one .

Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc took aim at the Conservatives after Johnston's announcement.

""The partisan attacks levied by the Conservative Party against the former governor general were unwarranted and are unacceptable. Democracy requires us to rise above partisan considerations,"" he said in a statement.

But Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre blamed the Liberals for putting Johnston in a tough spot and repeated his demand for a public inquiry.

""[Trudeau] has destroyed the reputation of a former governor general all to cover up his own refusal to defend Canada from foreign interests and threats,"" he said in a tweet.

Conservative ethics critic Michael Barrett told CBC that Trudeau was ""setting [Johnston] up for failure"" by not calling a public inquiry from the start.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that Johnston had ""done the right thing"" and again called on the government to launch a public inquiry.

WATCH | NDP House Leader reacts to Johnston's resignation

NDP House Leader reacts to David Johnston's resignation Duration 7:30 NDP House leader Peter Julian tells Power & Politics MPs should choose a replacement for special rapporteur David Johnston. 'It needs to be [someone] non-partisan. Let's work together to find that person and the mandate so that we can put this into place.'

In a separate statement, Singh said he respected Johnston but he had ""fallen victim to the bungled handling of foreign interference by the Liberal government.""

""When we tabled our motion calling for the special rapporteur to step aside, we said that the appearance of bias was too much to continue. I always thought that Mr. Johnston is an honourable man and today's decision shows that,"" Singh said.

Former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole took a similar tone, tweeting that Johnston is an ""exceptional Canadian"" and that his service to Canada has been ""extraordinary.""

""It is so disappointing that the prime minister used his stellar reputation as a political shield,"" O'Toole said.

WATCH | Bloc Québécois MP says Johnston 'did the right thing'

‘I think he did the right thing,’ says federal minister after special rapporteur resigns Duration 5:14 “It should have been done way before so public trust would not be as damaged,” René Villemure, Bloc Québécois MP and ethics critic, told Power & Politics Friday, referring to David Johnston’s resignation as special rapporteur on foreign interference. “I think this was a hard job to entertain in the first place.”

Bloc Québécois ethics critic René Villemure told CBC News Network's Power & Politics that stepping down was ""the only option"" for Johnston. He also said his party is still hoping the government will call a public inquiry.

""I think it's about time we move on, do something right and inform the populations what are the risks and what's at stake,"" he told host David Cochrane.

Prior to his resignation, questions were also being raised about the individuals Johnston chose to work with during his investigation.

On Tuesday, the Globe and Mail reported that Sheila Block, a lawyer Johnston hired to assist with his work, has donated to the Liberal Party in the past.

Read Johnston's resignation letter:

Johnston also told the procedure and House affairs committee on Tuesday that he has received unpaid informal advice from Don Guy, former chief of staff to former Ontario Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty, and Brian Topp, chief of staff to Rachel Notley when she was the NDP premier of Alberta.

CBC also reported last week that Johnston had hired communications crisis firm Navigator at the start of his mandate and that taxpayers were footing the bill.

Johnston cut ties with the firm after it was revealed that Navigator had also worked with Independent MP Han Dong, who was a subject of the former governor general's initial investigation and report.

WATCH | Former Conservative national campaign manager on Johnston's resignation

'I was totally taken aback': former Conservative national campaign manager reacts to Johnston's resignation Duration 9:36 Fred Delorey, former Conservative national campaign manager, speaks to Power and Politics about David Johnston's resignation as special rapporteur on foreign interference.

In his resignation letter, Johnston insisted that he doesn't think a public inquiry would be a ""useful way"" to address foreign interference, given that much of the intelligence associated with the issue is classified. But he called on Trudeau to appoint a new rapporteur.

""Ideally, you would consult with opposition parties to identify suitable candidates to lead this effort,"" he wrote.

Johnston was set to begin public hearings next month. In his letter, he calls for those to continue under new leadership.

The letter says he will be stepping down no later than the end of June after delivering a brief final report.

LeBlanc's statement said he would be consulting with experts and opposition parties on a replacement for Johnston.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

set to scrap dozens of troop carriers — even as Ukraine pleads for more equipment  CBC News,"The Canadian Army has dozens of older armoured personnel carriers it plans to send to the scrapheap this year — even though a private company has offered to refurbish them for use in Ukraine.

The Department of National Defence (DND) says 67 tracked light armour vehicles (TLAVs) out of a fleet of 140 are ""parked awaiting final demilitarization and disposal, or are being used as a source of spare parts"" for the 73 vehicles that remain in service.

All of the M113 troop carriers, which have been in service for decades, are in ""poor condition"" and are awaiting disposal, DND says. The Canadian army also has 195 LAV II Bisons and 149 Coyote armoured reconnaissance vehicles that will be taken out of service this year, as well.

The department says they will be replaced within the next few years by new Armoured Combat Support Vehicles (ACSVs).

Armatec Survivability, based in London, Ont., has offered to update surplus armoured vehicles, the federal Conservative opposition noted this week.

David Pratt, a former Liberal defence minister who speaks for the company, said the proposal is for the ""refurbishment of armoured vehicles in a number of variants, which could include infantry fighting vehicles, ambulances and support vehicles"" — but he insisted the M113s are not part of the plan. He refused to offer further details, citing ""commercial confidentiality.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to visit Ottawa on Friday, where he's expected to ask Canada for more military equipment, including additional armoured fighting vehicles and tanks.

Canada already has donated eight Leopard 2A4 tanks, 39 new ACSVs and 208 Roshel Senator armoured four-by-fours — part of what is now a $1.8 billion arms package for the embattled Eastern European nation.

A senior DND official this week acknowledged the Armatec proposal, adding no decision has been made. He would not indicate whether the proposal was being looked upon favourably.

""Ultimately, that's a decision that we pass up to policymakers and then we try and act,"" Ty Curran, the deputy director general of international security, told the House of Commons defence committee on Tuesday.

Curran said Armatec's pitch is one of several unsolicited offers that have landed on federal desks since the all-out Russian invasion of Ukraine began last year.

""The challenge, of course, around any of the donations that come out of ... [Canadian Armed Forces] inventory is balancing out the operational requirements,"" he said.

In a written response to a CBC News request for information on the M-113 vehicles, DND said that of the 73 operational TLAVs, 30 are considered reserve and are being held at military depots. That's in addition to the 67 already considered surplus and about to be junked.

Canada has to consider multiple factors before donating battlefield equipment to Ukraine, the department's written statement added.

'Very poor condition'

""Any equipment donated by Canada must be battlefield sustainable, but more importantly, must meet a specific need identified by Ukraine and be equipment that the Ukrainians are trained to use and have the resources and capabilities to maintain,"" the department said.

""The remaining quantity of M113s not being employed by the CAF are either awaiting final demilitarization and disposal due to being in very poor condition, or are being retained as a source of spare parts for the operational fleet.""

The Ukrainians are very familiar with the operation and maintenance of the M113. Ukraine has received, or is in the process of receiving, over 560 of the troop carriers from the United States, Lithuania, Denmark, Spain and Italy, among other countries.

During Tuesday's committee hearing, Conservative defence critic James Bezan said both the United States and Australia are interested in partnering with Canada in the Armatec venture because they also want to put their surplus vehicles into the field for Ukraine.

Bezan asked Curran to explain the proposal's status. He said Armatec told him it could refurbish as many as eight armoured vehicles each month.

Curran didn't directly answer that question, prompting committee chair Liberal MP John McKay to ask for clarification.

The federal government has set aside up to $500 million for the current budget year for military hardware donations to Ukraine, Curran said, adding the Armatec project could be funded out of that pool of money.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

reigns over number of missing, murdered indigenous women  CBC News","Patty Hajdu tells reporters on her way into a Cabinet meeting that Native Women's Association suggests MMIW numbers could thousands higher than RCMP numbers

Canada's minister for the status of women suggests the number of missing and murdered indigenous women could be as high as 4,000, but a dearth of hard data means it's all but impossible to pinpoint an accurate figure.

Patty Hajdu told reporters Tuesday that the government doesn't have an exact number, but pointed to research from the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) that puts it at 4,000, much higher than a figure near 1,200 the RCMP has previously stated.

The comment comes after Hajdu and Carolyn Bennett, the minister for indigenous affairs and northern development, wrapped up cross-country talks Monday ahead of a formal national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women.

Activists working for the Walk 4 Justice initiative started collecting the names of indigenous women who are missing or murdered — they stopped counting when they got to 4,232.

Dawn Lavell-Harvard, the president of NWAC, said the names of those women were shared with her organization and Chuck Strahl, the former Conservative minister of Indian affairs and northern development. No further action was taken at the time.

Lavell-Harvard said the anecdotal evidence was also shared with the Liberal cabinet ministers during the recent pre-inquiry talks.

However, when CBC News contacted one of the activists who supplied NWAC with the information, she said ""roughly 60 to 70 per cent"" of the 4,000 or so people on her list were indigenous.

Gladys Radek, co-founder of Walk 4 Justice, said her group collected the names while speaking to people during a trek across Canada in 2008. They stopped collecting information in 2011.

NWAC said the confusion around the number emphasizes the need for clear data on this issue. ""Lives are too important to rely on an informal database,"" Lavell-Harvard said.

""The gulf between 1,200 and pushing 4,000 is huge. Even if it is somewhere in the middle, it is still an outrageous number to [not have been investigated] until this point. I think that's why it's so important that this inquiry happen,"" she said.

RCMP figure in doubt

A 2014 report by the RCMP concluded 1,017 aboriginal women had been slain between 1980 and 2012, and that another 164 were considered missing.

Hajdu, who represents Thunder Bay–Superior North, said the 4,000 number is more believable because there is a history of police underreporting homicides, or failing to investigate suspicious deaths.

""When you actually start to add in, you know, disputed cases, for example, people that have claimed it's a suicide or death due to exposure, but in fact there's symptoms or signs that maybe it wasn't, then of course the numbers jump,"" Hajdu said ahead of a Liberal cabinet meeting.

Bennett, for her part, would not speculate, but has said that the number is ""way, way higher,"" than the RCMP's 1,200 figure.

""I don't have the data, but I know the problem is not about us fighting about the numbers. The problem is making sure that these families that lost a loved one, these survivors that are still living, that their stories lead us to the kind of concrete actions that will actually put an end to their vulnerability and what has been going on,"" Bennett said Tuesday.

The minister said the RCMP ""did their very best"" in trying to come up with an accurate number, but she said the testimony she heard at the pre-inquiry talks puts that figure in serious doubt.

Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett says the number of missing and murdered indigenous women is 'way, way higher' than the approximately 1,200 documented by the RCMP in a 2014 report. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

""We have heard enough stories to hear that if you count these deaths, that were called a suicide or other things, we have anecdotal evidence that the problem is greater,"" she said. ""I think it's important we look to the root causes.""

Lavell-Harvard said the RCMP's number is incomplete because of a history of mistrust between the police and indigenous communities.

""Part of the challenge comes from the fact that very often many families, because of negative interactions in the past, because of racism, have not in fact reported when a loved one goes missing,"" she said in an interview with CBC News on Monday. ""There's a lack of willingness to trust police forces and to come forward.""

Dust off cold cases, families urge

Bennett said many families of missing or murdered indigenous women want police to dust off cold cases, or actually launch investigations.

""The families want certain cases reopened, we heard that coast to coast to coast. But there's also the common theme of the uneven application of justice, from the quality of the search to whether it's called a murder or not, to the charges that are laid, to the plea bargaining ... it seems to the families that this is very different if the victim is indigenous,"" Bennett said.

""What the families would say is that a lot of these cases were never opened in the first place because there was never an investigation ... time and time again the family will tell you that the file is empty. There was no investigation.""

Lavell-Harvard said finding justice for indigenous families will be at the heart of a national inquiry.

""If there has been [police] misconduct, then it needs to be addressed,"" she said.

""That is going to be absolutely central to reopening some of these cold cases that have been sitting for many, many years. If we find there wasn't an adequate investigation in the first place, then those need to be looked at; our women deserve that much,"" she said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

more Pornhub? That will depend on what happens with a Senate bill  CBC News,"The owners of Pornhub say blocking access to Canadians is among options they're considering as they try to persuade parliamentarians to reject an approach for age verification outlined in a controversial Senate bill.

""We've taken different options in different jurisdictions,"" said Solomon Friedman, a partner and vice-president of compliance at Ethical Capital Partners, which owns Pornhub's parent company, Aylo.

""I don't want to speculate on (the bill) in its current state. We're going to committee to ensure that the wrong legislation doesn't get passed.""

A House of Commons committee is set to study legislation proposed by Independent Sen. Julie Miville-Dechêne that would require Canadians to verify their age to access porn online.

The bill outlines a range of concerns about minors having access to sexually explicit material, including the potential to develop a pornography addiction and the reinforcement of harmful gender stereotypes.

It proposes companies that host such material ensure young people cannot access it, under threat of fines between $250,000 and $500,000.

The legislation doesn't specify how sites should verify a user's age, but options include the establishment of a digital ID system or services that can estimate an individual's age based on a visual scan of their face.

Such suggestions have prompted widespread concern from privacy experts about the overarching impacts, from the risks associated with asking Canadians to share personal information with an external provider to the use of measures such as facial recognition technology.

Others have warned age verification could lead to a stifling of free expression, as some companies would likely rather block access to their sites.

Others, they warn, could simply find ways to skirt the rules.

Examples of laws abroad

Sitting at a cafe in downtown Ottawa last week, Friedman said his company shares concerns about minors accessing Pornhub, one of the largest porn sites on the internet.

""We want no children on our platform whatsoever.""

Not only is that from a moral standpoint, he says, but also a commercial one.

In 2023, his firm acquired ownership of Pornhub's parent company as it was reeling from reports that exploded in late 2020 about the site being home to countless examples of child sexual abuse material and other images and videos uploaded without an individual's consent.

The reports led payment companies such as Visa and MasterCard to pull their services from the site.

Pornhub scrubbed millions of unverified videos from its platform and put in new safety protocols.

Similar laws requiring internet porn sites to verify a user's age have been passed in several U.S. states, including Louisiana. After it required that a government ID be used to access Pornhub, traffic took a nosedive.

After Utah passed a bill that Friedman said did not include an option to use a government ID, Pornhub blocked access altogether to residents of that state.

LISTEN | Federal government grappling with online harms bill: The House 10:36 Urgency grows for Liberals to introduce online harms legislation Between the rise in online antisemitism and Islamophobia and horrific recent cases of sextortion involving young people, there are many pressing issues that could be addressed by the Liberals' long-promised online harms legislation. Host Catherine Cullen speaks to Canada Research Chair in Cybersecurity Law Emily Laidlaw and OpenMedia’s Matt Hatfield about what a new law might look like — and why it’s taking so long to come to light.

Friedman argued such laws will not achieve the desired effect of shielding children from sexually graphic material, but will only push them to even darker corners of the internet to sites that may not comply with the law.

What the company is pushing for instead is for the onus to be put on manufacturers of devices being used to access sites, rather than on the sites themselves.

""We will never ever take the private identifying information of our users,"" he said.

""(We) will always comply with the law,"" he said.

""That's either by imposing the solution, not operating ... or in addition to all those, challenging these in law, if we think that they violate some higher legal principle like the Constitution.""

So far, Liberal MPs have been the only ones to vote against the proposed law.

New Democrats, Bloc Quebecois and Conservatives voted in favour of sending the bill to committee.

NDP House Leader Peter Julian said in a statement that New Democrats supported the bill because of its intent to protect minors.

Federal Justice Minister Arif Virani says upcoming legislation to protect against online harms will look carefully at those that most affect children. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)

""We look forward to examining the bill at the committee, including through the testimony of community, health and public safety experts, to understand the full impact of the proposed legislation.""

Tories have routinely raised concerns about children's access to sexually explicit material, while also decrying government efforts to regulate social media companies as censorship.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's office did not respond to a request for comment by publication deadline.

Ontario MP Karen Vecchio, who sponsored the bill in the House, told MPs back in December that she agreed personal information shouldn't be collected by individual sites.

However, she expressed hope that a solution can be found as technology advances.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has long promised to legislate new protections against online harms, including those that most affect children.

Justice Minister Arif Virani has signalled the upcoming bill will put a major focus on children's safety while also respecting freedom of expression.

When asked about it directly, his office declined to say whether age verification would be a part of the measures it's considering.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

'al-Qaeda-supported' plot against Via train thwarted  CBC News,"Canadian police and intelligence agencies arrest 2 men in an alleged 'terror plot' targeting Via Rail

Police say they have arrested two men accused of conspiring to carry out an ""al-Qaeda supported"" attack targeting a Via passenger train in the Greater Toronto Area, following a cross-border investigation that involved Canadian and American law enforcement.

In a press conference that followed a report by CBC's Greg Weston, police named the two accused as Chiheb Esseghaier, 30, of Montreal, and Raed Jaser, 35, from Toronto. They have been charged with conspiracy to carry out a terrorist attack and ""conspiring to murder persons unknown for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a terrorist group.""

RCMP officials said the two accused were plotting to derail a passenger train. Jennifer Strachan, chief superintendent of RCMP criminal operations in the province of Ontario, said the two suspects watched trains and railways in the Greater Toronto Area.

""We are alleging that these two individuals took steps and conducted activities to initiate a terrorist attack,"" she told reporters.

There was a specific route targeted, not necessarily a specific train, Strachan said, although she declined to reveal the route. According to a Reuters report, U.S. law enforcement and national security sources said the alleged plot targeted a rail line between Toronto and New York City.

The two men arrested are not Canadian citizens but were in the country legally, police said Monday. Investigators would not provide any details about their nationalities.

The RCMP accused the two men of conspiring to commit an ""al-Qaeda-supported"" attack.

RCMP Assistant Commissioner James Malizia said the two accused were getting ""direction and guidance"" from al-Qaeda elements in Iran. There was no information to suggest the attacks were state sponsored, he said.

Radio-Canada, CBC's French service, has learned that Chiheb Esseghaier studied at University of Sherbrooke, before moving to Institute National de la Recherche Scientifique in Varennes, Que., for doctoral research.

The two men are expected to appear at Old City Hall courthouse in Toronto tomorrow.

Alleged attack in planning stage

""Had this plot been carried out, it would have resulted in innocent people being killed or seriously injured,"" Maliza told reporters on Monday.

Strachan said the attack was in the planning state but ""not imminent.""

RCMP said while they believe the individuals accused had the ""capacity and intent"" to carry out an attack, they believed there was ""no imminent threat"" to the public, rail employees, train passengers or infrastructure.

In a statement, Via Rail reiterated that ""at no time"" was there an imminent threat to the safety of the public or Via rail passengers or staff.

""We co-operate with all involved in ensuring the safety and security of our passengers, our employees and the public,"" Via said. According to Via, its trains carry nearly four million passengers annually.

Police have been investigating since August 2012. International intelligence sources tell CBC News that Canadian law enforcement agencies were ready to shut down the alleged plot and make the arrests months ago.

But partly at the urging of U.S. intelligence agents, the investigation was left open.

Sources said that while the U.S. law enforcement agencies were co-operating in the investigation of the alleged train plot, they also wanted to know who else might be involved.

The CIA has been particularly interested in the al-Qaeda operatives in Iran supporting the alleged terrorist plot in Canada.

Intelligence sources say the Boston Marathon attacks changed everything. It is unclear if that pushed the Americans to urge Canada to shut down the alleged train plot or if it compelled Canadian authorities to simply act on their own.

Toronto Imam Yusuf Badat, of the Islamic Foundation of Toronto, told CBC's Evan Solomon that RCMP officers said they received tips from the Muslim community that led to the arrests.

RCMP spoke to community leaders before the news briefing held Monday. Badat said none of the community leaders that were present at the briefing had heard of the two men arrested.

Cross-border co-operation

RCMP officials said the investigation, called Operation Smooth, was ongoing, but declined to provide details.

Highly placed sources tell CBC News the alleged plotters have been under surveillance for more than a year in Quebec and southern Ontario.

The investigation was part of a cross-border operation involving Canadian law enforcement agencies, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The arrests Monday morning were co-ordinated and executed by a special joint task force of RCMP and CSIS anti-terrorism units, combined with provincial and municipal police forces in Ontario and Quebec.

Public Safety Minister Vic Toews congratulated the RCMP, CSIS and local law enforcement and thanked the FBI for their assistance.

""Today's arrests demonstrate that terrorism continues to be a real threat to Canada,"" Toews told reporters on Parliament Hill Monday. ""The success of Operation Smooth is due to the fact that Canada works very closely with international partners to combat terrorism.""

He declined to take questions, citing the ongoing investigation.

U.S. Ambassador David Jacobson also congratulated the RCMP and said in a statement the arrests were the result of ""extensive"" cross-border co-operation.

""It underscores the fact that we face serious and real threats, and that security is a shared responsibility,"" Jacobson said. ""We all need to remain vigilant in confronting threats and keeping North America safe and secure.""

Law enforcement officials say the terror suspects arrested today have no connection to the two brothers accused of last week's Boston Marathon bombings.

They also say there is no tie to the former London, Ont., high school friends who joined al-Qaeda and died earlier this year while helping to stage a bloody attack on an Algerian gas refinery.

The plot is reminiscent of another that was broken up in the summer of 2006, when police arrested 18 people in a massive anti-terrorism sweep in southern Ontario.

Eleven of the 18 were subsequently convicted of aiding the group in various plots, ranging from blowing up the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill and the Toronto Stock Exchange with trucks laden with explosives to beheading the prime minister and other politicians.

The group never got a chance to execute any of its plans before being arrested when one of its members took delivery of what they thought were three tonnes of fertilizer to be used in truck bombs. Undercover agents had replaced the shipment with harmless chemicals.

Four are serving sentences of 18 years to life in prison, while the other seven received terms ranging from 30 months to just over seven years.

More recently, three Canadian citizens were arrested in August, 2010 — two Ottawa men and a London, Ont. doctor — and charged with knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity.

One of them, Hiva Alizadeh, was also charged with possession of more than 50 circuit boards allegedly to be used as remote detonators for bombs.

The cases involving those three have yet to go to court.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

accuses India's government of involvement in killing of Canadian Sikh leader  CBC.ca,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the government of India of involvement in the fatal shooting of a Canadian Sikh leader — a claim that will have seismic effects on an already shaky bilateral relationship.

Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar was brazenly shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, B.C. on June 18.

Nijjar, a supporter of a Sikh homeland in the form of an independent Khalistani state, had been branded by the Indian government as a ""terrorist"" and accused of leading a militant separatist group — something his supporters have denied.

Now, Trudeau said, Canada's national security apparatus has reason to believe that ""agents of the Indian government"" carried out the killing of this Canadian citizen, who also served as the president of Surrey's Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara.

WATCH | Trudeau links Indian government to fatal shooting in Canada: Trudeau says 'credible allegations' link India to killing of Sikh leader in Canada Duration 2:47 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says any foreign government involvement in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is 'an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty.'

""Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar,"" Trudeau said Monday in a speech to the House of Commons.

""Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty. It is contrary to the fundamental rules by which free, open and democratic societies conduct themselves.

""As you would expect, we have been working closely and co-ordinating with our allies on this very serious matter.""

A senior government source told CBC News that Trudeau has briefed the leaders of some of Canada's closest allies about the case, including U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden.

Trudeau also urged the Indian government to participate in the ongoing investigation and ""co-operate with Canada to get to the bottom of this matter.""

India's ministry of external affairs issued a statement Monday night rejecting Trudeau's allegations, calling them ""absurd.""

""Such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists, who have been provided shelter in Canada and continue to threaten India's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the statement said.

""The inaction of the Canadian Government on this matter has been a long-standing and continuing concern.""

Trudeau said some Indo-Canadians are feeling ""angry"" and ""perhaps frightened right now.""

""Let us not allow this to change us,"" he said.

Canada, India expel diplomats

Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said she has ordered the expulsion of ""a senior Indian diplomat.""

Joly's office said that diplomat is Pavan Kumar Rai, the head of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India's foreign intelligence agency, in Canada.

""My expectations are clear. I expect India to fully collaborate with us and get to the bottom of this,"" Joly said.

Hours later, India said it had expelled a Canadian diplomat with five days' notice to leave the country.

In a statement early Tuesday, India's foreign ministry said the Canadian high commissioner, or ambassador, in New Delhi had been summoned and told of the expulsion decision.

""The decision reflects the government of India's growing concern at the interference of Canadian diplomats in our internal matters and their involvement in anti-India activities,"" the ministry added.

WATCH | Canada expels Indian diplomat as it investigates death of Sikh leader: Canada expels Indian diplomat as it investigates death of Sikh leader Duration 1:25 Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly says allegations that an agent connected to the Indian government was behind the death of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar are 'troubling' and 'completely unacceptable' if true.

Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the RCMP is leading the murder investigation.

""We'll hold the perpetrators accountable and bring them to justice,"" he said.

B.C.'s Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) is responsible for the Nijjar file.

""It's progressing,"" RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme told CBC News when asked about the investigation.

The World Sikh Organization of Canada, a group that represents Sikh interests, said Nijjar spoke of ""threats to his life"" before his alleged murder.

He also claimed he was being targeted by India's intelligence agencies, the WSO said in a media statement.

Sikh group says 'India actively targets Sikhs in Canada'

The WSO said ""several other Canadian Sikhs are also understood to be under threat"" and are on Indian ""hit lists.""

""The significance of today's announcement cannot be understated for Sikhs,"" the WSO said.

""Today, the prime minister of Canada has publicly said what Sikhs in Canada have known for decades — India actively targets Sikhs in Canada.""

Trudeau said he raised the matter with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week at the G20 summit in New Delhi.

Trudeau and Modi have long had a frosty relationship.

After the bilateral meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of that summit, the Indian government released a tersely worded communique that said Modi raised with Trudeau ""strong concerns about continuing anti-Indian activists of extremist elements in Canada.""

The statement said there are elements in Canada ""promoting secessionism"" and ""inciting violence against Indian diplomats, damaging diplomatic premises and threatening the Indian community in Canada.""

The Indian government called on the two countries to co-operate in dealing with ""such threats.""

The Canadian communique on the same meeting made no mention of ""secessionism."" It's now clear why.

WATCH | Trudeau links India to killing of Canadian Sikh leader: Trudeau links India to killing of Canadian Sikh leader Duration 12:57 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday accused the government of India of being involved in the fatal shooting of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C., in June. CBC's Evan Dyer breaks down what we know.

Last Tuesday, Trudeau and the Canadian delegation left India after an extended stay caused by a technical problem on the prime minister's plane.

One member of the delegation was absent.

National Security Adviser Jody Thomas quietly left India for London, U.K., instead, a government source told CBC News.

She informed the U.K. government that Canada's relations with India were about to get worse now that Canada had credible evidence linking India's government to Nijjar's death, the source said.

Trudeau also briefed the Opposition leaders personally Monday before rising to tell Canadians about this development.

WATCH | Opposition leaders react: Opposition leaders react to Trudeau's allegations about Sikh leader's death Duration 7:24 Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh call on the Indian government to cooperate with Canadian authorities during their investigation.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said it's ""outrageous"" that India may be behind Nijjar's killing.

""Our citizens must be safe from extrajudicial killings. Canadians deserve to be protected on Canadian soil. We call on the Indian government to act with utmost transparency as authorities investigate this murder. The truth must come out,"" Poilievre said.

""Let us lock arms and join hands in condemning this murder, standing with the family and the friends of this victim. Let's put aside our difference to stand up for the rule of law. One law for all our people.""

In his own speech, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh blasted the Indian government under Modi, a Hindu.

Singh said the Modi-led government has been ""one of division, violence, persecution"" with a known pattern of ""attacking those who are critical"" of its actions.

WATCH | Minister says government has been 'confronting' Indian officials: LeBlanc: India's possible link to killing of Sikh leader 'an extraordinary violation of Canada's sovereignty' Duration 12:14 Minister of Public Safety Dominic LeBlanc says the government has been 'confronting' Indian officials since it became aware of 'credible allegations' a 'number of weeks ago.'

Singh said he'd use ""every tool"" at his disposal to ""bring those responsible to justice.""

""We will ensure that no rock is unturned, that every possible link is examined,"" Singh said.

He said that the public inquiry into foreign interference, which was prompted by allegations of Chinese meddling, should also look at India and its actions in Canada.

B.C. Premier David Eby said he was ""deeply disturbed and angered"" by the news.

""In light of these revelations, we will do all we can to enhance protection for the people of British Columbia against the violence or threats of state actors,"" he said in a media statement.

""Our government will fully and enthusiastically support any federal efforts to ensure those responsible are held personally accountable.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

news links in Canada in response to online news law  CBC.ca,"Google said Thursday it will remove Canadian news content from its search, news and discover products after a new law meant to compensate media outlets comes into force.

The move to pull news from the world's most popular search engine could have a devastating impact on Canadian media outlets, which often depend on third parties like Google to get content into the hands of readers.

The decision comes after the government's contentious C-18 legislation passed Parliament last week. The bill has been criticized by tech giants like Meta and Google who say it's unfair to impose what amounts to a tax on links.

Some smaller media outlets and experts have blasted the regime because they claim the bulk of the financial benefits will accrue to a handful of a large media players.

""We're disappointed it has come to this. We don't take this decision or its impacts lightly and believe it's important to be transparent with Canadian publishers and our users as early as possible,"" said Kent Walker, the president of global affairs at Google and Alphabet.

""The unprecedented decision to put a price on links (a so-called 'link tax') creates uncertainty for our products and exposes us to uncapped financial liability simply for facilitating Canadians' access to news from Canadian publishers.""

The government and larger media outlets, including the newspaper lobby group and broadcasters like the CBC and CTV, have said social media companies should compensate news outlets for the use of their content.

'Deeply irresponsible'

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez suggested Thursday he has no intention of backing down from this fight with the American web giants that control so much of what Canadians read and watch.

""Big tech would rather spend money to change their platforms to block Canadians from accessing good quality and local news instead of paying their fair share to news organizations,"" Rodriguez said in a statement.

Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez called Google's decision to eventually move Canadian news content from its site a ""deeply irresponsible"" move. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

""This shows how deeply irresponsible and out of touch they are, especially when they make billions of dollars off of Canadian users. Canada needs to have a strong, free and independent press. It's fundamental to our democracy.""

Rodriguez added in an interview with CBC News that he was surprised by Google's statement because the government's talks with the company are ongoing.

""We're still having conversations with Google as recent at this morning,"" he said. ""Google knows very well that the clarity they need is coming soon through regulation.""

Just yesterday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was confident Google would come around on the legislation.

""I will say the conversations with Google are ongoing. It is important that we find a way to ensure that Canadians can continue to access content in all sorts of ways but also that we protect rigorous independent journalism that has a foundational role in our democracies,"" he said.

""We know that democracies only work with a strong independent diverse media and we will continue to work for that.""

WATCH: Trudeau says he's 'disappointed' by Meta's reaction to online news law

Trudeau says he's 'disappointed' with Meta's threat to end access to news on Facebook, Instagram Duration 1:17 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government will continue to work with social media giants to 'ensure that Canadians can continue to function online in free and open ways.'

Meta already has said it will block Canadian news content on popular platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

Trudeau called Meta's decision ""extremely disappointing.""

""Facebook continues to refuse to accept its responsibility towards our democracy by refusing to pay its fair share,"" Trudeau said.

The bill has been pitched as a way to keep news outlets solvent after advertising moved en masse to digital platforms, virtually wiping out a major revenue stream for journalism.

The dominance over advertising once enjoyed by legacy media is over. Google and Facebook have a combined 80 per cent share of all online ad revenue in Canada and rake in an eye-popping $9.7 billion a year, according to government data.

According to government figures, more than 450 news outlets in Canada have closed since 2008 and at least one third of Canadian journalism jobs have disappeared over that same time period.

Print and digital news businesses have struggled to make money from their content after losing major revenue streams, such as classified ads and subscriptions.

In an era of cord-cutting, some private and public broadcasters also have failed to adequately monetize their airwaves to pay for local, regional and national radio and TV news.

After years of losing money, Bell Media-owned CTV recently announced deep cuts, essentially closing the company's foreign bureaus and downsizing their footprint in Ottawa and Washington, D.C.

Pointing to layoffs and a struggling news industry, Rodriguez said Thursday ""the status quo is not working."" He said the new legislation is meant to ""level the playing field by putting the power of big tech in check.""

In an attempt to reverse the revenue decline, the government's new regulatory regime will require companies like Google and the Meta-owned Facebook — and other major online platforms that reproduce or facilitate access to news content — to either pay to post content or go through a binding arbitration process led by an arms-length regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

An outlet will be considered an eligible news business if it regularly employs two or more journalists in Canada, operates largely within Canada and produces content that is edited and designed in this country.

Google and Meta have signalled they'd rather get out of the news-posting business altogether rather than deal with this process.

In a separate statement, a spokesperson for Google Canada said the government's legislation ""will make it harder for Canadians to find news online, make it harder for journalists to reach their audiences, and reduce valuable free web traffic to Canadian publishers.""

But Google signalled it may be willing to change course if the government addresses some of its concerns.

""We hope that the government will be able to outline a viable path forward,"" said Google spokesperson Shay Pardy.

CBC/Radio-Canada could be a beneficiary of this new federal program because it operates one of the largest news sites in the country and links to its content are regularly shared on other platforms.

Under the new law, CBC is required to provide an annual report on any compensation for news it receives from digital operators.

""We all depend on an open Internet. It would be unfortunate if the digital platforms used their dominance to deny Canadians access to news and information. We encourage Canadians to go directly to the websites and apps they trust for their news,"" said Leon Mar, a spokesperson for CBC/Radio Canada.

OpenMedia, an advocacy group that has attacked the bill in the past, said Thursday that Google's decision is ""exactly what we warned Heritage Minister [Pablo] Rodriguez about.""

""Unfortunately, the way this bill was written made news blocking inevitable,"" said Matt Hatfield, the group's campaigns director.

""Instead of building a much-needed sustainable funding model that would support quality and diverse news, C-18's failures will make it even more difficult for Canadians to access the news they need on the platforms they use.""

Michael Geist is a Canada research chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa and a fierce critic of the bill.

He said Rodriguez, the minister who shepherded this legislation through Parliament, ""did not take risks of the flawed Bill C-18 seriously.""

Geist said the minister is ""squarely to blame"" for Google's decision, which risks imperilling an already fragile industry.

""Cannot overstate the harm from this: news sector loses hundreds of millions, Canadians face degraded search results, and prominence of low-quality sources increase,"" Geist tweeted.

In a media statement, the NDP was scathing in its criticism of Google.

The party's heritage critic, Peter Julian, said ""multibillionaire web giants"" like Google and Meta are ""playing games"" with the future of Canadian media, something he called a ""shameful"" practice akin to ""bullying.""

""When the time comes to draw the line and ask them to pay their fair share, Meta and Google resort to bullying tactics showing Canadians their true colours: if they don't like the rules, they won't follow them — even if those rules are in place to protect good quality journalism and Canadians,"" Julian said.

Julian said the same companies now threatening to block news content have been slow to root out the disinformation and ""hate speech"" that regularly circulates on their platforms.

They're throwing their weight around now, Julian said, and trying to stop a bill that ""enhances fairness in the news market.""

chief accessibility officer 'furious' after Air Canada forgets her wheelchair  CBC.ca,"Canada's chief accessibility officer is taking airlines to task for failing to treat wheelchair users with respect after Air Canada forgot last week to bring her wheelchair on a cross-country flight.

Stephanie Cadieux said that when she flew from Toronto to Vancouver on Friday, she discovered that her wheelchair had been left behind.

She posted about the incident on X, formerly Twitter. Her posting received overwhelming support — almost 650 retweets and more than 2,500 likes.

""This was immensely frustrating and dehumanizing — and I was furious,"" she later said in a post on her LinkedIn account . ""The tweet has been widely viewed and shared. Air Canada responded and my chair has been returned to me.""

A statement from Air Canada said the chair was returned Saturday morning.

Cadieux said that while her chair was swiftly and safely returned to her by the airline, her ""job title as chief accessibility officer should not influence the experience"" she has when she flies.

Well. <a href=""https://twitter.com/AirCanada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@AirCanada</a> left my chair in Toronto. I’m now without my essential equipment. Independence taken away. I’m furious. Unacceptable. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/RightsOnFlights?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#RightsOnFlights</a> <a href=""https://t.co/h1WPUwlgxw"">pic.twitter.com/h1WPUwlgxw</a> —@Stephanie4BC

""While I'm glad I've been able to draw attention to this issue, I don't want the continued focus to be on my experience,"" she said.

""Not surprisingly to me, many of the responses to my tweet were from people sharing that the same thing had happened to them, with no quick resolution.""

Cadieux said everyone who uses an airline should get the same level of service, regardless of job title.

Airlines have to do better: Cadieux

Cadieux said she travels a lot for work and over the past year her wheelchair has been damaged in transit several times.

""I've heard and continue to hear countless stories about lost or severely damaged chairs and enough is enough,"" she said.

Cadieux said airlines do not provide appropriate care and attention to essential equipment like wheelchairs, and leave disabled travellers to fight alone when things go wrong.

""I want everyone to understand that when a person's wheelchair is lost, so is their independence, safety, mobility and dignity,"" she said. ""Airlines have to take responsibility and they have to do better.""

Federal Minister of Diversity, Inclusion and Persons with Disabilities Kamal Khera said on social media the situation ""is completely unacceptable.""

""Persons with disabilities deserve equal rights and access while boarding planes or using public transit,"" she said.

An Air Canada statement emailed to CBC News said the airline has apologized to Cadieux and the company recognizes ""mobility devices are vital to their users""

Air Canada says it's working to improve accessibility

""As part of our investigation into how this serious service lapse occurred, we are also looking for additional measures we can implement to prevent such situations in the future,"" the statement said.

The statement said the airline carries more than 700,000 travellers requiring wheelchairs or mobility devices in a normal year and ""the vast, vast majority … travelled without issue.""

The airline said that in the summer, it began rolling out a three-year accessibility plan for customers and employees. Under the plan, the airline is creating an advisory panel of customers with disabilities and is purchasing equipment to improve accessibility.

invests $100M in 'historic' action plan for 2SLGBT communities  CBC.ca,"The federal government unveiled what it described as a historic first on Sunday as it announced a five-year, $100-million plan to support 2SLGBT communities across the country.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled the strategy, dubbed ""Canada's first Federal 2SLGBTQI+ Action Plan,"" at a news conference on Sunday ahead of the Pride parade in Ottawa — the first in-person march after a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19.

Trudeau touted the plan as the first such federal initiative of its kind, and said it demonstrates the government's commitment to fighting discrimination and supporting diversity.

""This will guide our ongoing work to fight discrimination, break down barriers, to advance rights and to build a future where everyone in Canada is truly free to be who they are and love whom they love,"" Trudeau said on Sunday.

Trudeau said 75 per cent of the funding will go toward community organizations focused on diversity and inclusion because that's ""where the real work of support comes from.""

""The strength and resilience of your communities should inspire everyone,"" he said.

The federal government previously announced in this year's budget that it would earmark $100 million to benefit 2SLGBT people. The action plan included details of where the money would go.

More than $5 million of the funding will go toward the launch of a public awareness campaign, while $7.7 million has been earmarked for data collection and community led policy research to support federal action on 2SLGBT issues.

Further action on conversion therapy possible

Debbie Owusu-Akyeeah, executive director of the Canadian Centre for Gender & Sexual Diversity, said the strategy was ""long awaited and overdue,"" adding more supports are needed including in schools.

She said Canada has lagged behind many other countries, such as the U.K., Ireland and the Netherlands, which already have government action plans.

She said figures from Statistics Canada have shown a sharp rise in hate crimes toward people from the 2SLGBT communities.

Trudeau signalled the government would look at ""further protections and support"" for people who survived conversion therapy, which he called ""a cruel and dangerous practice"" and which was criminalized earlier this year in Canada.

The federal government is facing calls to tighten the ban to cover practices designed to try to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity offered online from abroad, including the United States.

Wisdom2Action executive director Fae Johnstone, who attended the launch, said there was a need to invest in mental-health counselling for people traumatized by the discredited practice.

""Tens of thousands of people were subjected to it and it's still happening today,"" Johnstone said.

The federal government also signalled that it will look at further legislative changes as part of its action plan. It plans to launch a public consultation on whether to make it illegal to perform cosmetic surgery on intersex children's genitals until they are mature enough to give consent.

The strategy proposes to adopt and encourage the use of the 2SLGBTQI+ acronym, ""which is more inclusive and places the experiences of Indigenous 2SLGBTQI+ communities at the foreground as the first 2SLGBTQI+ peoples in North America.""

The acronym stands for two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and additional sexually and gender diverse people.

More direct support needed, groups told government

Marci Ien, minister of women and gender equality, welcomed the action plan alongside Trudeau, saying the funds are for ""all of those people who are fighting to be heard and accepted.""

""This is for the people who were discarded by their family and friends after they came out, to everybody trying to live their truth in rural communities where they feel isolated. This is for the Black queer people who are fighting every day to justify their place in this country, and the trans women who are afraid sometimes to walk home alone in the dark, this is for you,"" Ien said.

She said the strategy was created following several years of consultation and research with members of the 2SLGBT communities.

Ottawa received more than 25,000 responses in 2020-2021 to a national online survey on how to better serve diverse communities, Ien said.

""The resounding answer was that they needed more direct support ... to offer programs to continue educating the wider public because, again, we can't legislate kindness,"" Ien said.

Effort to get military records continues

The plan pledges to invest up to $10 million per year in 2SLGBT projects abroad.

Trudeau said Canada had welcomed thousands of people from 2SLGBT communities fleeing discrimination abroad and warned of ""rights moving backwards in many parts of the world — some closer than we would like to admit.""

WATCH | Police say attack on Vancouver man during Pride week motivated by hate: Ottawa unveils plan to support 2SLGBT communities Duration 2:01 The federal government has announced $100 million dollars over five years to help 2SLGBT communities across the country. The announcement was made the same day police in Vancouver released video showing the assault of a man following Pride events earlier in the summer.

Michelle Douglas, who won a landmark legal challenge against the Canadian Armed Forces over discrimination against 2SLGBTQ service members, said there was still much work to do to stamp out such practices.

Douglas, a former member of the military police who was honourably discharged in 1989 as part of a ""purge"" of members of the 2SLGBT community, said she also wanted all the records relating to policies toward 2SLGBT personnel released.

""We have about 10,000 pages and we know there are more,"" she said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

fighters engaged in 'unsafe' intercept of Canadian surveillance plane, commander says  CBC News","A Canadian surveillance plane conducting a sanctions enforcement patrol was intercepted Monday by Chinese warplanes off the coast of China in an ""unsafe and unprofessional manner,"" a senior Canadian air force commander said.

The incident involving the CP-140 Aurora — which was monitoring the shipping lanes of the East China Sea for signs of vessels trying to violate the oil embargo against North Korea — happened while news crews from Radio Canada and Global News were aboard the aircraft.

It took place in full view of Maj.-Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of the 1st Air Division, and navy Capt. Rob Watt, Canada's defence attache to Japan.

WATCH: Chinese warplanes intercept Canadian surveillance plane 'Very aggressive:' Chinese warplanes intercept Canadian surveillance plane Duration 0:55 Maj.-Gen. Iain Huddleston says Chinese warplanes intercepted a Canadian plane conducting a sanctions enforcement patrol in an ""unsafe and unprofessional manner.""

""We're solidly in international airspace,"" Huddleston told reporters while looking out the window of the patrol plane at a Chinese fighter jet armed with air-to-air missiles. ""That last sequence was an unprofessional intercept … It was very aggressive.""

The Aurora was intercepted several times during its eight hour patrol — something Huddleston says is to be expected, given the proximity to the Chinese coast. The Canadian crew took no issue with the first series of encounters.

But according to the aircraft crew, a Chinese fighter came within five meters of the Canadian surveillance aircraft during the final encounter — and at one point slipped into a position where the Aurora was tucked into the blindspot of the warplane. It also launched multiple flares while flying close to the Aurora.

""We can fly in close formation with other airplanes and be completely safe, but it's when aircraft aggressively manoeuvre in close proximity to the others that there's a safety issue,"" Huddleston said.

Speaking to reporters later Monday, Defence Minister Bill Blair described the Chinese fighters' actions as ""dangerous and reckless.""

""Those type of behaviours are not ever acceptable, and we will express that to the People's Republic of China in the most appropriate way,"" Blair said.

latest moves could bottle up much of Russia's naval power  CBC.ca,"Since midnight Wednesday, Moscow time, Russia has been warning the world that any ship approaching a Ukrainian port ""will be regarded as potential carriers of military cargo.""

This obvious threat to sink commercial shipping appears to be an attempt to prevent ships from taking on Ukrainian grain. This week, Russia unilaterally ended talks on renewing the Black Sea Grain Initiative that has allowed food to flow to other countries from Ukraine, despite the war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked Turkey to join him in a new arrangement to protect grain ships without Russia's involvement. Turkey has yet to respond.

The threat to sink commercial shipping marks an escalation that can only be carried out under a state of declared war, said Tanya Grodzinski, a naval historian at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ont. That's something Russian President Vladimir Putin has been anxious to avoid, opting instead to present his war on Ukraine as a ""special military operation.""

The new threat may say more about Russia's weakness than its strength, as the strategic balance in the waters around European Russia shifts against it.

The day the NATO summit in Vilnius opened — July 11 — was marked in Cuba by the arrival of the Russian Navy warship Perekop of the Baltic Fleet.

The Cuban government welcomed the Perekop — the biggest Russian warship to visit Cuba in many years — with a cannon salute from Havana's old fort.

For Moscow, the visit allowed Russia to project its military power into the Americas and show support for the Cuban Communist Party, a close ally, on the second anniversary of a popular revolt against its rule.

But as the fanfare unfolded in Havana, events in Vilnius that morning and the night before were building a new fence around the Perekop's home ports of St Petersburg and Kaliningrad. Russia's Baltic fleet will still be able to sail in peacetime but it's being strategically bottled up as its home sea becomes a NATO lake.

And to the south, Russia's storied Black Sea fleet, already hurt by the humiliating loss of its flagship Moskva, faces an uncertain future and the possible loss of both its bases and its naval supremacy.

One way in, one way out

The Baltic and the Black Sea share a geographical feature: they both have only one slender opening into the world's oceans.

In the Baltic, three narrow straits separate Denmark from Sweden; the widest, between two Danish islands, is a mere 16 kilometres across.

Ships seeking to exit the Black Sea to enter the Mediterranean must sail the Bosphorus River and the Dardanelles Strait — both of which are entirely within the territorial waters of NATO member Turkey.

Four days after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Turkey closed the straits to all warships, a move that principally affects Russia.

For those reasons, Russia has long preferred to station the main part of its blue water navy and its nuclear submarines at its Arctic and Pacific ports.

Grodzinski said the Baltic and Black Sea fleets were central to Russia's emergence as a great power after the 1790s. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and NATO's response to it, threatens that standing, she added.

""If this was viewed as a gamble on the part of Mr. Putin to recreate this image he has of Russia, this historic image of Russian being a great power, it's being thwarted diplomatically in the Baltic and militarily in Ukraine and the Black Sea,"" she told CBC News.

""The implications for his leadership and position could be quite significant.""

A Baltic ringed by NATO

Putin and his defenders have claimed he launched his war to keep NATO away from Russia's borders. Instead, the conflict triggered a new round of NATO expansion that this year caused Russia's border with the alliance to more than double in length. The accession of Finland in April added more than 1,300 kilometres of NATO-Russia border.

The green light for Sweden to join the alliance, which came on the eve of the Vilnius summit, turns the Baltic Sea into NATO's backyard.

WATCH | NATO countries pledge weapons, training to Ukraine: Ukraine secures weapons, training from G7 and NATO countries Duration 2:06 Canada, Japan, the U.S. and other NATO countries have pledged weapons and training as part of security guarantees to Ukraine. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it is meant to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that Canada supports Ukraine and will continue to do so.

At the start of the year, the northern shores of the Baltic, including both sides of the Gulf of Bothnia, were neutral territory. Sweden and Finland, two countries that maintain highly professional navies and air forces, had for decades remained outside of the European alliance.

Now, every inch of Baltic shoreline outside of Russian waters is controlled by NATO allies — allies that are increasingly well-armed.

""You're seeing this rejuvenation of naval forces all across Europe,"" said Grodzinski. ""Sweden, Norway, Finland and so forth are expanding their navies. There is a greater NATO presence in in the Baltic Sea, which never really occurred before. So there's a completely different dynamic.""

The Swedes, said retired Canadian admiral Mark Norman, ""have an incredibly capable military with some very advanced technologies, many of which are homegrown or organic capabilities. They are experts in what I would call sea control in relatively shallow waters.

""They're experts in mining, counter-mining. They are experts in submarining and in anti-submarining. These are vital capabilities.""

A Russian ship leaving Saint Petersburg must first sail through the Gulf of Finland, where only about 80 kilometres of open water separate Helsinki from the Estonian capital Tallinn. NATO is now on both sides of that narrow strait. The even narrower corridor of international waters in the middle is within easy range of NATO's sea-skimming missiles from either shore.

Arctic alternative far from ideal

The new political geography of the region means ""in effect, in any form of conflict, the Baltic gets cut off,"" said maritime and arctic security expert Rob Huebert of the University of Calgary.

""We're not going to be able to see any real movement from the Russians in any capacity because the forces that the Nordic countries, combined with the Americans, bring into the region now mean that point of departure simply will not exist for the Russians.

""The Russian ability to move any naval assets now is increasingly being limited to off the Kola Peninsula as a result of both what's happening with the Black Sea and what is happening with the Baltic Sea.""

Huebert was referring to Russia's Arctic bases, such as Murmansk, where it bases nuclear submarines and much of its strategic nuclear missile force.

During the Second World War, with the Baltic in German hands, Murmansk and the White Sea port Archangel were the destinations for convoys that delivered four million tonnes of western lend-lease material to help the Soviet war effort.

The difficult local sea and ice conditions were notorious then and remain a challenge today, said Huebert.

""Climate change of course is opening it up, but it's still a limited amount of openness at this point in time,"" he said. ""You still need to have icebreakers to get through. And we see this every year, when the Russians are trying to encourage more shipping through the northern sea route and we're still seeing ships getting stuck.""

Turkey a rising naval power

Russia's other major fleet is based at Vladivostok in the Pacific. Like the Kola Peninsula, Vladivostok is a long way from some of the areas where Russia wants to project power, and also a long way from Russia's own centres of population.

Russia's Baltic problem is the result of a change of heart in NATO member Turkey that also affects the Black Sea, where Turkey controls the lion's share of the coast.

Turkey's navy has also been going through a major upgrade, while Russia's Black Sea fleet has suffered losses during the war with Ukraine — including the embarrassing loss of the Moskva, sunk by a Ukrainian missile.

""Whatever the price of Turkey for allowing Sweden to come in, we suspect that they will probably be playing a more active role in NATO,"" said Huebert.

Even after the invasion of Ukraine, he said, Ankara seemed to be looking for ways to draw closer to Russia. No longer.

""The suspicion is that some type of agreement was reached, with the terms not publicly released,"" said Huebert.

Turkey could have received assurances on its eventual EU membership, for example, or its desire to purchase F-16 fighter jets from the U.S., or other issues that have plagued its relations with Western allies.

""We may never know exactly what's changed Erdogan's mind here,"" said Norman, ""but Turkey has had a change of heart and that is good for NATO.""

A safe harbour no longer

The other major threat to Russia's Black Sea fleet is, of course, Ukraine.

Ever since its founding by Prince Potemkin in 1783, the Black Sea fleet's home port has been Sevastopol in Crimea. Ukraine allowed Russia to continue to operate its bases there after the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 2014, Russia annexed the peninsula anyway.

The recapture of Crimea is now a Ukrainian war goal. But until very recently, Sevastopol had been mostly out of range of Ukrainian weapons.

That has changed as the front has crept south and new weapons have arrived from Ukraine's allies.

Ukraine's acquisition of British Storm Shadow and French SCALP missiles (essentially the same weapon) brings the entire Crimean peninsula within range. The U.S. is currently considering providing ATACMS ballistic missiles, which have an even longer range.

""It severely hampers [the Russians'] freedom of manoeuvre,"" said Norman.

It also makes the port of Sevastopol fundamentally unsafe for Russian warships.

""That has enormous operational implications,"" Norman said. ""It's a well-established doctrine in naval affairs that the best place to take out any naval asset is alongside, before it goes to sea.

Johnston resigning as special rapporteur on foreign interference  CBC.ca,"David Johnston — tasked by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau back in March with looking into allegations that China tried to meddle in the past two federal elections — says he has decided to step down from that role.

In a resignation letter sent to Trudeau, Johnston said his role has become too muddled in political controversy for him to continue.

""When I undertook the task of independent special rapporteur on foreign interference, my objective was to help build trust in our democratic institutions,"" the former governor general wrote.

""I have concluded that, given the highly partisan atmosphere around my appointment and work, my leadership has had the opposite effect.""

A government source said Johnston made his own decision to resign and wasn't asked to step down by the Prime Minister's Office.

Since his appointment, Johnston has been accused of being unfit for the job because of his personal connections to Trudeau.

The leaders of the Conservative and Bloc Québécois parties have both said Trudeau and Johnston are self-declared friends and their longstanding ties are too close to allow Johnston to judge the prime minister's actions.

Johnston has said that while he was friends with Pierre Trudeau and skied with the Trudeau family back when Justin Trudeau and his brothers were children, he hasn't had any meetings, dinners or personal contacts with Trudeau in the past 40 years.

WATCH | Johnston says he doesn't regret taking on role

David Johnston says he doesn't regret taking on foreign interference assignment Duration 0:23 'When you're asked to serve your country, you do so,"" Johnston says in an exclusive interview with Power and Politics host David Cochrane.

That didn't stop opposition parties from questioning Johnston's investigation of foreign interference. Even the NDP — which currently has a supply-and-confidence deal with the governing Liberals — put forward a motion in the House calling on Johnston to step aside because of an ""appearance of bias."" The motion passed with Conservative and Bloc support.

At the time, Johnston said he planned to stay on until his mandate was complete.

In his initial report released last month, Johnston recommended against calling a public inquiry on foreign interference — despite opposition parties and diaspora groups calling for one .

Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc took aim at the Conservatives after Johnston's announcement.

""The partisan attacks levied by the Conservative Party against the former governor general were unwarranted and are unacceptable. Democracy requires us to rise above partisan considerations,"" he said in a statement.

But Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre blamed the Liberals for putting Johnston in a tough spot and repeated his demand for a public inquiry.

""[Trudeau] has destroyed the reputation of a former governor general all to cover up his own refusal to defend Canada from foreign interests and threats,"" he said in a tweet.

Conservative ethics critic Michael Barrett told CBC that Trudeau was ""setting [Johnston] up for failure"" by not calling a public inquiry from the start.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that Johnston had ""done the right thing"" and again called on the government to launch a public inquiry.

WATCH | NDP House Leader reacts to Johnston's resignation

NDP House Leader reacts to David Johnston's resignation Duration 7:30 NDP House leader Peter Julian tells Power & Politics MPs should choose a replacement for special rapporteur David Johnston. 'It needs to be [someone] non-partisan. Let's work together to find that person and the mandate so that we can put this into place.'

In a separate statement, Singh said he respected Johnston but he had ""fallen victim to the bungled handling of foreign interference by the Liberal government.""

""When we tabled our motion calling for the special rapporteur to step aside, we said that the appearance of bias was too much to continue. I always thought that Mr. Johnston is an honourable man and today's decision shows that,"" Singh said.

Former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole took a similar tone, tweeting that Johnston is an ""exceptional Canadian"" and that his service to Canada has been ""extraordinary.""

""It is so disappointing that the prime minister used his stellar reputation as a political shield,"" O'Toole said.

WATCH | Bloc Québécois MP says Johnston 'did the right thing'

‘I think he did the right thing,’ says federal minister after special rapporteur resigns Duration 5:14 “It should have been done way before so public trust would not be as damaged,” René Villemure, Bloc Québécois MP and ethics critic, told Power & Politics Friday, referring to David Johnston’s resignation as special rapporteur on foreign interference. “I think this was a hard job to entertain in the first place.”

Bloc Québécois ethics critic René Villemure told CBC News Network's Power & Politics that stepping down was ""the only option"" for Johnston. He also said his party is still hoping the government will call a public inquiry.

""I think it's about time we move on, do something right and inform the populations what are the risks and what's at stake,"" he told host David Cochrane.

Prior to his resignation, questions were also being raised about the individuals Johnston chose to work with during his investigation.

On Tuesday, the Globe and Mail reported that Sheila Block, a lawyer Johnston hired to assist with his work, has donated to the Liberal Party in the past.

Read Johnston's resignation letter:

Johnston also told the procedure and House affairs committee on Tuesday that he has received unpaid informal advice from Don Guy, former chief of staff to former Ontario Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty, and Brian Topp, chief of staff to Rachel Notley when she was the NDP premier of Alberta.

CBC also reported last week that Johnston had hired communications crisis firm Navigator at the start of his mandate and that taxpayers were footing the bill.

Johnston cut ties with the firm after it was revealed that Navigator had also worked with Independent MP Han Dong, who was a subject of the former governor general's initial investigation and report.

WATCH | Former Conservative national campaign manager on Johnston's resignation

'I was totally taken aback': former Conservative national campaign manager reacts to Johnston's resignation Duration 9:36 Fred Delorey, former Conservative national campaign manager, speaks to Power and Politics about David Johnston's resignation as special rapporteur on foreign interference.

In his resignation letter, Johnston insisted that he doesn't think a public inquiry would be a ""useful way"" to address foreign interference, given that much of the intelligence associated with the issue is classified. But he called on Trudeau to appoint a new rapporteur.

""Ideally, you would consult with opposition parties to identify suitable candidates to lead this effort,"" he wrote.

Johnston was set to begin public hearings next month. In his letter, he calls for those to continue under new leadership.

The letter says he will be stepping down no later than the end of June after delivering a brief final report.

set to scrap dozens of troop carriers — even as Ukraine pleads for more equipment  CBC.ca,"The Canadian Army has dozens of older armoured personnel carriers it plans to send to the scrapheap this year — even though a private company has offered to refurbish them for use in Ukraine.

The Department of National Defence (DND) says 67 tracked light armour vehicles (TLAVs) out of a fleet of 140 are ""parked awaiting final demilitarization and disposal, or are being used as a source of spare parts"" for the 73 vehicles that remain in service.

All of the M113 troop carriers, which have been in service for decades, are in ""poor condition"" and are awaiting disposal, DND says. The Canadian army also has 195 LAV II Bisons and 149 Coyote armoured reconnaissance vehicles that will be taken out of service this year, as well.

The department says they will be replaced within the next few years by new Armoured Combat Support Vehicles (ACSVs).

Armatec Survivability, based in London, Ont., has offered to update surplus armoured vehicles, the federal Conservative opposition noted this week.

David Pratt, a former Liberal defence minister who speaks for the company, said the proposal is for the ""refurbishment of armoured vehicles in a number of variants, which could include infantry fighting vehicles, ambulances and support vehicles"" — but he insisted the M113s are not part of the plan. He refused to offer further details, citing ""commercial confidentiality.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to visit Ottawa on Friday, where he's expected to ask Canada for more military equipment, including additional armoured fighting vehicles and tanks.

Canada already has donated eight Leopard 2A4 tanks, 39 new ACSVs and 208 Roshel Senator armoured four-by-fours — part of what is now a $1.8 billion arms package for the embattled Eastern European nation.

A senior DND official this week acknowledged the Armatec proposal, adding no decision has been made. He would not indicate whether the proposal was being looked upon favourably.

""Ultimately, that's a decision that we pass up to policymakers and then we try and act,"" Ty Curran, the deputy director general of international security, told the House of Commons defence committee on Tuesday.

Curran said Armatec's pitch is one of several unsolicited offers that have landed on federal desks since the all-out Russian invasion of Ukraine began last year.

""The challenge, of course, around any of the donations that come out of ... [Canadian Armed Forces] inventory is balancing out the operational requirements,"" he said.

In a written response to a CBC News request for information on the M-113 vehicles, DND said that of the 73 operational TLAVs, 30 are considered reserve and are being held at military depots. That's in addition to the 67 already considered surplus and about to be junked.

Canada has to consider multiple factors before donating battlefield equipment to Ukraine, the department's written statement added.

'Very poor condition'

""Any equipment donated by Canada must be battlefield sustainable, but more importantly, must meet a specific need identified by Ukraine and be equipment that the Ukrainians are trained to use and have the resources and capabilities to maintain,"" the department said.

""The remaining quantity of M113s not being employed by the CAF are either awaiting final demilitarization and disposal due to being in very poor condition, or are being retained as a source of spare parts for the operational fleet.""

The Ukrainians are very familiar with the operation and maintenance of the M113. Ukraine has received, or is in the process of receiving, over 560 of the troop carriers from the United States, Lithuania, Denmark, Spain and Italy, among other countries.

During Tuesday's committee hearing, Conservative defence critic James Bezan said both the United States and Australia are interested in partnering with Canada in the Armatec venture because they also want to put their surplus vehicles into the field for Ukraine.

Bezan asked Curran to explain the proposal's status. He said Armatec told him it could refurbish as many as eight armoured vehicles each month.

Curran didn't directly answer that question, prompting committee chair Liberal MP John McKay to ask for clarification.

The federal government has set aside up to $500 million for the current budget year for military hardware donations to Ukraine, Curran said, adding the Armatec project could be funded out of that pool of money.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

for closer Canada-U.S. ties, Biden says 'our destinies are intertwined and they're inseparable'  CBC.ca","U.S. President Joe Biden delivered an impassioned speech in the House of Commons Friday, saying the Canada-U.S. relationship has never been stronger while calling for even closer ties to take on the challenges of our times.

Standing in front of the Speaker's chair as hundreds of MPs, senators and dignitaries looked on, Biden said Canadians and Americans are ""two people"" that ""share one heart"" — bound together not only by geography and history but shared democratic values.

In his nearly 40-minute speech, Biden said that, together, the two countries are an unstoppable force that can tackle climate change, a changing economy and an increasingly dangerous world, where authoritarian countries like Russia are bent on defying international norms.

The partnership, he said, extends to space — three Americans and a Canadian will soon be headed for the moon as part of the NASA Artemis program.

""Our destinies are intertwined and they're inseparable,"" Biden said.

""I mean this from the bottom of my heart. There is no more reliable ally, no more steady friend. And today I say to you, you will always be able to count on the United States of America.""

WATCH: We will find 'no more steady friend' than Canada: Biden

We will find 'no more steady friend' than Canada: Biden Duration 1:16 During his address to Parliament, U.S. President Joe Biden says Canadians 'can always count on the United States of America.'

Together, Biden said, Canada and the U.S. will confront the ""scourge"" of opioid overdoses.

He vowed to partner with Mexico to tackle the illicit trade in fentanyl, which has wreaked havoc on vulnerable communities throughout North America.

Trudeau, Biden reach agreements during two-day visit

Canada and the U.S. will expand the Safe Third Country Agreement to the entire land border — a move designed to halt illegal border crossing by migrants. Canada will instead accept up to 15,000 migrants from the Western Hemisphere through legal channels.

Canada will invest $420 million to protect the Great Lakes as part of a binational effort to defend one of the world's largest sources of freshwater.

Canada made a $7.3 billion commitment to air defence to support the continued functioning of NORAD.

Canada agreed to provide $100 million to support the Haitian police.

The U.S. will commit roughly $250 million to Canadian and U.S. companies that mine and process critical minerals for electric vehicles and stationary storage batteries.

Canada and New York-based IBM signed a deal to expand domestic research and development and advanced packaging of semiconductors.

Biden expressed support for Canada joining the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework

Referencing a deal on migrants, Biden said Canada and the U.S. will safely resettle asylum seekers through a new, more organized process that discourages illegal immigration.

""We believe to our core that every single person deserves to live in dignity, safety and rise as high as their dreams can carry them,"" Biden said.

On semiconductors, critical minerals, advanced manufacturing and a pivot to a cleaner, greener economy, Biden said Canada and the U.S. are up to the challenge — ready to work in concert to challenge the dominance of countries like China in these areas.

""After two years of COVID, people began to even wonder, 'Can we still do big things?' I say we sure in hell can,"" Biden said to thunderous applause from the assembled crowd.

While there are irritants in any relationship, Biden said, Canada and the U.S. are determined to ""solve our differences in friendship and with good will, because we both understand our interests are fundamentally aligned.""

WATCH: 'I like your teams, except the Leafs': Biden addresses Parliament

'I like your teams, except the Leafs': Biden addresses Parliament Duration 2:11 In his speech in Parliament during his first official visit as U.S.president to Canada, Joe Biden spoke of the friendly nature of the relationship between the two countries.

Biden joked about the Toronto Maple Leafs (""I like your teams, except the Leafs,"" he said to laughter and scattered boos from the crowd) and razzed some MPs who failed to stand and applaud after he praised Canada and the U.S. for having gender equal cabinets.

""Even if you don't agree guys, I'd stand up,"" he said.

He also raised a recent Gallup poll that found Americans have an overwhelmingly positive view of Canadians.

The poll found 88 per cent of U.S. respondents think highly of their neighbours to the north — up from 87 per cent last year. ""I take credit for that one point,"" Biden said.

In his introductory speech, Trudeau hit many of the same points. He called on Canadians and Americans to come together as storm clouds gather in other parts of the world.

""It has never been clearer that everything is interwoven,"" he said. ""Economic policy is climate policy is security policy. People need us to think strategically and act with urgency, and that is exactly what brings us together today.""

WATCH: U.S.-Canada border is a 'meeting place rather than dividing line': Trudeau

U.S.-Canada border is a 'meeting place rather than dividing line': Trudeau Duration 0:44 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada and the U.S. will continue to foster their long-standing relationship and work together for a better future.

As conflict rages in Europe and inflation bears down on working people, Trudeau said the two countries have faced all of this before.

Citing a 1987 address by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan, who called the Canada-U.S. border a ""meeting place rather than a dividing line,"" Trudeau said the border is ""not just a place where we meet each other. It's a place where we will meet the moment.""

Touting recent investments in a Michelin tire plant in Nova Scotia, and plans to retool the Defasco steel factory in Hamilton, Ont., Trudeau said Canada is ready to work with the U.S. to take on economic competition from ""an increasingly assertive China.""

""We must continue to show resilience, perseverance and strength,"" Trudeau said, citing the example of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, the two Canadians who suffered arbitrary detention in China for more than 1,000 days.

Kovrig and Spavor were on hand in the Commons for Friday's events. Trudeau thanked Biden for his help in securing their release.

With two of its citizens in captivity, Trudeau said, Canada did ""not capitulate, we did not abandon our values — we doubled down. We rallied our allies. The rule of law prevailed and the Michaels came home.""

""God bless ya,"" Biden said as he recognized Spavor and Kovrig in the gallery above.

Earlier today, Biden was escorted by Trudeau into the West Block where he briefly greeted dignitaries, including Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, other party leaders, senators, the House of Commons Speaker and parliamentary clerks.

Poilievre introduced himself as the leader of his ""His Majesty's Loyal Opposition,"" which prompted Biden to quip, ""Loyal, huh?""

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May then handed a bemused Biden a chocolate bar made by a Syrian refugee before he was whisked away for a one-on-one meeting with Trudeau.

The busy day followed an intimate gathering last night at Trudeau's Ottawa home, Rideau Cottage. Trudeau, with his wife Sophie and their three kids, hosted the president and his wife, Jill.

This is the first non-summit overnight visit by a U.S. president in nearly two decades.

It was billed as a chance for Biden and Trudeau to continue their efforts to renew the bilateral relationship, which was marked by some tension in recent years.

The Trump years were a trying time for Canadian officials.

But Biden's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline, promote protectionist policies like Buy American and withhold some vaccine supplies were also irritants in the early days of his presidency.

Since then, there's been meaningful progress on key files: a deal to protect the NEXUS trusted traveller program and a plan to include Canadian-made vehicles in a U.S. electric vehicle tax credit program.

Biden arrives in Ottawa as Roxham Road deal reached Duration 4:39

And now there is a deal in hand that will allow Canada to close the Roxham Road site, where tens of thousands of refugee claimants have crossed the border irregularly in recent years — a political headache for Trudeau.

The U.S. has been eager to see Canada take a leadership role in efforts to restore order in Haiti, which has descended into chaos in recent months as gangs have tightened their grip on some parts of the Caribbean country.

So far, Canada has resisted pressure to deploy troops.

But after meeting with Biden, Trudeau commited roughly $100 million to the Haitian police.

The funding comes after the UN expressed grave concern for Haiti, saying ""extreme violence continues to spiral out of control.""

Biden and Trudeau also had the economy on their minds during the visit.

Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — which was really a climate-change bill, despite its name — includes major tax breaks for companies that pursue green-friendly projects.

Canada is racing to compete — and there may be a role for Canadian businesses to play as the U.S. retools its economy to make it cleaner and greener.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference following his address, Biden said the IRA shouldn't be seen as a threat to Canada.

He said the U.S. plan to spend billions through the IRA and CHIPS Act, which offers tax breaks to semiconductor companies that manufacture in the U.S., will have spillover effects for Canada.

""We each have what the other needs,"" Biden said. ""I'm a little confused on why this is a disadvantage for Canada.""

He said U.S. businesses need to tap Canada's abundance of critical minerals — an industry that currently is dominated by China, an increasingly unreliable business partner.

""We don't have the minerals to mine, you can mine them. You don't want to produce, I mean, turn them into product,"" Biden said.

WATCH: Biden, Trudeau speak to media in Ottawa

U.S. President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speak to media in Ottawa Duration 42:17 During his first official visit to Canada since his election, U.S President Joe Biden held a press conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in which they discussed the long-standing relationship between the two countries.

Canada would dispute Biden's characterization of the critical minerals file.

The federal government has raced to sign multi-billion dollar contracts with major car companies like Stellantis and Volkswagen, which will use Canadian natural resources to manufacture components for electric vehicles.

The economist Harold Innis once described Canadians as ""hewers of wood and drawers of water,"" a reference to Canada's long economic dependence on resources.

Trudeau said Friday Canada doesn't just extract minerals and ship them off.

""The world is understanding they can no longer rely on places like China or Russia,"" he said. ""They can rely on Canada to not just be a purveyor of ores, but of finished materials.""

looking to drop 24 Sussex and build new home for PM elsewhere: sources  CBC.ca,"The federal government is looking at dropping the dilapidated mansion at 24 Sussex in Ottawa as the prime minister's official residence and is considering several other sites in the city for a replacement, sources say.

The various federal agencies in charge of the PM's official residence have identified other plots of land where they could build an official residence that is larger, safer and more accessible than the one that served prime ministers from 1951 to 2015.

The residence at 24 Sussex is in a state of disrepair after decades of neglect, and the grounds are simply too small to meet modern security standards, several sources and experts have told Radio-Canada.

One of the lots under consideration is in Rockcliffe Park, an idyllic spot along the Ottawa River that regularly hosts picnics and weddings, sources said.

The park has a secondary parking lot, surrounded by woods, in a less frequented area. It's also farther from the road and from the Ottawa River than 24 Sussex — factors which make it a preferred option among security experts, sources said.

The government also has evaluated a site near the RCMP Musical Ride training centre to the east of Rockcliffe Park. Sources said the flat terrain there is more visible from the road and the site would require fencing that would make it look more like a fortress.

Other plots of land owned by the federal government are also being studied. The leader of the Official Opposition's residence at Stornoway was even considered at one time, said a source.

Another option being examined is to move the PM's residence permanently to Rideau Cottage on the grounds of Rideau Hall. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been living there in a ""temporary"" arrangement since 2016.

The government insists no final choice has been made.

""There is no option that has unanimous support, and every option has its pros and cons,"" said a federal government source.

'It's embarrassing'

In the midst of a housing and cost-of-living crisis, the construction of a new official residence costing tens of millions of dollars would be a political headache for the federal government, which has been dithering over 24 Sussex's fate for years.

""I think it's embarrassing that a G7 country can't provide a safe, secure residence for the head of government and their family,"" said former clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, who was the head of the federal public service from 2016 to 2019.

Plans to renovate 24 Sussex were made during Trudeau's first mandate but the government decided the price tag was too high and the potential for political controversy too great.

""My understanding is there's no way to make [24 Sussex] safe at a reasonable cost,"" said Wernick.

WATCH | There's no way to make 24 Sussex secure enough to house a PM: 24 Sussex may never house another prime minister Duration 2:26 The official residence of the prime minister, 24 Sussex Drive, may never house another prime minister. The federal government is looking into options for a more modern and secure house for future prime ministers.

Built in 1868, 24 Sussex later served as the official residence of a succession of Liberal and Conservative prime ministers, from Louis St-Laurent's arrival in 1951 until Stephen Harper's departure in 2015.

Prime ministers have welcomed many international luminaries to 24 Sussex, from U.S. presidents like John F. Kennedy to pop stars like Bono and royalty like Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles (when he was Prince Charles) and Princess Diana.

After he was elected in 2015, Trudeau refused to move into 24 Sussex because the residence was in need of extensive renovations after years of neglect. Among other things, the building's faulty electrical systems posed a fire hazard at the time.

""The initial preference was to renovate 24 Sussex, but no one realized the extent of the necessary renovations that were needed,"" said a source who was involved in the deliberations at the time.

In a report published in 2021, the NCC estimated that the ""deferred maintenance deficit"" at 24 Sussex stood at $37 million — a figure which does not include the need to spend tens of millions of dollars on better security.

Security shortcomings

A major problem for 24 Sussex is the residence's proximity to a busy street — which could make a truck bomb attack on the prime minister more lethal. The short distance between the road and the residence also would make it harder for police to respond to a surprise attack.

To prevent drone attacks, steel plates need to be installed on 24 Sussex's roof. That would require installing a metal skeleton around the frame that one source warned could turn 24 Sussex into a ""bunker.""

""In 1951, it was a good choice to install our prime minister here but now the building is no longer up to standard,"" said Pierre-Yves Bourduas, a former RCMP deputy commissioner who was once responsible for the security of official residences in the Ottawa area.

""Security has changed enormously over the past 10 years and in this context, we need to rethink the location of the prime minister's residence.""

Faced with 24 Sussex's deterioration, the National Capital Commission announced it was ""closing"" the residence earlier this year. Work to remove the heating and electrical systems is set to begin in September.

The house suffers from a long list of problems, including mould in the pool and sauna area, rodent infestations and asbestos.

A hot potato

Several government officials said there are many arguments in favour of relocating the official residence. These sources were granted confidentiality to speak about a file that is still open within the government.

""Everyone knows that renovating everything can cost more than building something new,"" said a source involved in decisions about 24 Sussex.

Beyond its structural and security problems, the site at 24 Sussex isn't large enough to include a reception area.

""Most G7 and Commonwealth leaders receive official visitors in a space dedicated for these purposes. Canada currently lacks such dedicated spaces,"" the NCC said in a 2022 report.

The main residence at 24 Sussex amounts to roughly 12,000 square feet. The NCC says the prime minister's official residence needs about 16,000 square feet, including space for official functions, security and staff.

The NCC suggests the residence should have 4,700 square feet for private family quarters, including a primary bedroom, four bedrooms for children and three bedrooms to accommodate relatives, friends or other guests.

The NCC said it thinks the official residence should be able to accommodate groups of at least 15 to 30 people for professional meetings.

Trudeau's current residence at Rideau Cottage is less than ideal from a security standpoint, said sources — it has clear sight lines from nearby buildings and also lacks metal roof plating to repel drone attacks.

One former adviser to Trudeau said having the elected prime minister living on the grounds next to the King's representative in Canada also sends the wrong message.

""It doesn't make sense for the Prime Minister to live in the Governor General's backyard,"" the former adviser said.

Ottawa has said it could make a decision about 24 Sussex by the fall. July's cabinet shuffle may slow down that process — Jean-Yves Duclos, Trudeau's seventh minister of public services and procurement, only recently took over the file.

Building a new official residence in Rockcliffe Park would meet many security requirements but would run the risk of encountering opposition from the park's users.

Russell Gibson, president of the Rockcliffe Park Residents Association in Ottawa, said he hopes the government comes up with plans for an official residence ""that we can all be proud of."" To get there, he said, it will be important for the NCC to proactively consult members of the community before making final choices.

University of Montreal professor emeritus Christina Cameron, an expert on Canada's built heritage, said the government should keep 24 Sussex as the PM's official residence. She said the building, which has been visited by major figures in world history over the decades, is part of Canada's story.

""I think we should keep it, save it,"" said Cameron, a former chair of the NCC's Official Residences Advisory Committee.

""No one will make a decision because they don't want to be criticized that they're doing something for themselves. So I find that very frustrating and short-term thinking and I think it's not appropriate for Canada.""

It's almost certain that Justin Trudeau won't be prime minister once (or if) a new residence is built — which could make the decision easier for him.

""At this stage, it will be for someone else,"" said a Liberal source.

Wernick said many projects of this kind have run up against a strong NIMBY reaction from Ottawa residents opposed to major developments. He added that prime ministers are very skittish about the appearance of buying a big house for themselves at taxpayers' expense.

""I think there's a chill created by adverse media coverage and political backlash. There's no upside for the prime minister — for any prime minister — to make this call,"" he said.

accuses India's government of involvement in killing of Canadian Sikh leader  CBC.ca,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the government of India of involvement in the fatal shooting of a Canadian Sikh leader — a claim that will have seismic effects on an already shaky bilateral relationship.

Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar was brazenly shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, B.C. on June 18.

Nijjar, a supporter of a Sikh homeland in the form of an independent Khalistani state, had been branded by the Indian government as a ""terrorist"" and accused of leading a militant separatist group — something his supporters have denied.

Now, Trudeau said, Canada's national security apparatus has reason to believe that ""agents of the Indian government"" carried out the killing of this Canadian citizen, who also served as the president of Surrey's Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara.

WATCH | Trudeau links Indian government to fatal shooting in Canada: Trudeau says 'credible allegations' link India to killing of Sikh leader in Canada Duration 2:47 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says any foreign government involvement in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is 'an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty.'

""Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar,"" Trudeau said Monday in a speech to the House of Commons.

""Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty. It is contrary to the fundamental rules by which free, open and democratic societies conduct themselves.

""As you would expect, we have been working closely and co-ordinating with our allies on this very serious matter.""

A senior government source told CBC News that Trudeau has briefed the leaders of some of Canada's closest allies about the case, including U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden.

Trudeau also urged the Indian government to participate in the ongoing investigation and ""co-operate with Canada to get to the bottom of this matter.""

India's ministry of external affairs issued a statement Monday night rejecting Trudeau's allegations, calling them ""absurd.""

""Such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists, who have been provided shelter in Canada and continue to threaten India's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the statement said.

""The inaction of the Canadian Government on this matter has been a long-standing and continuing concern.""

Trudeau said some Indo-Canadians are feeling ""angry"" and ""perhaps frightened right now.""

""Let us not allow this to change us,"" he said.

Canada, India expel diplomats

Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said she has ordered the expulsion of ""a senior Indian diplomat.""

Joly's office said that diplomat is Pavan Kumar Rai, the head of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India's foreign intelligence agency, in Canada.

""My expectations are clear. I expect India to fully collaborate with us and get to the bottom of this,"" Joly said.

Hours later, India said it had expelled a Canadian diplomat with five days' notice to leave the country.

In a statement early Tuesday, India's foreign ministry said the Canadian high commissioner, or ambassador, in New Delhi had been summoned and told of the expulsion decision.

""The decision reflects the government of India's growing concern at the interference of Canadian diplomats in our internal matters and their involvement in anti-India activities,"" the ministry added.

WATCH | Canada expels Indian diplomat as it investigates death of Sikh leader: Canada expels Indian diplomat as it investigates death of Sikh leader Duration 1:25 Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly says allegations that an agent connected to the Indian government was behind the death of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar are 'troubling' and 'completely unacceptable' if true.

Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the RCMP is leading the murder investigation.

""We'll hold the perpetrators accountable and bring them to justice,"" he said.

B.C.'s Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) is responsible for the Nijjar file.

""It's progressing,"" RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme told CBC News when asked about the investigation.

The World Sikh Organization of Canada, a group that represents Sikh interests, said Nijjar spoke of ""threats to his life"" before his alleged murder.

He also claimed he was being targeted by India's intelligence agencies, the WSO said in a media statement.

Sikh group says 'India actively targets Sikhs in Canada'

The WSO said ""several other Canadian Sikhs are also understood to be under threat"" and are on Indian ""hit lists.""

""The significance of today's announcement cannot be understated for Sikhs,"" the WSO said.

""Today, the prime minister of Canada has publicly said what Sikhs in Canada have known for decades — India actively targets Sikhs in Canada.""

Trudeau said he raised the matter with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week at the G20 summit in New Delhi.

Trudeau and Modi have long had a frosty relationship.

After the bilateral meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of that summit, the Indian government released a tersely worded communique that said Modi raised with Trudeau ""strong concerns about continuing anti-Indian activists of extremist elements in Canada.""

The statement said there are elements in Canada ""promoting secessionism"" and ""inciting violence against Indian diplomats, damaging diplomatic premises and threatening the Indian community in Canada.""

The Indian government called on the two countries to co-operate in dealing with ""such threats.""

The Canadian communique on the same meeting made no mention of ""secessionism."" It's now clear why.

WATCH | Trudeau links India to killing of Canadian Sikh leader: Trudeau links India to killing of Canadian Sikh leader Duration 12:57 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday accused the government of India of being involved in the fatal shooting of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C., in June. CBC's Evan Dyer breaks down what we know.

Last Tuesday, Trudeau and the Canadian delegation left India after an extended stay caused by a technical problem on the prime minister's plane.

One member of the delegation was absent.

National Security Adviser Jody Thomas quietly left India for London, U.K., instead, a government source told CBC News.

She informed the U.K. government that Canada's relations with India were about to get worse now that Canada had credible evidence linking India's government to Nijjar's death, the source said.

Trudeau also briefed the Opposition leaders personally Monday before rising to tell Canadians about this development.

WATCH | Opposition leaders react: Opposition leaders react to Trudeau's allegations about Sikh leader's death Duration 7:24 Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh call on the Indian government to cooperate with Canadian authorities during their investigation.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said it's ""outrageous"" that India may be behind Nijjar's killing.

""Our citizens must be safe from extrajudicial killings. Canadians deserve to be protected on Canadian soil. We call on the Indian government to act with utmost transparency as authorities investigate this murder. The truth must come out,"" Poilievre said.

""Let us lock arms and join hands in condemning this murder, standing with the family and the friends of this victim. Let's put aside our difference to stand up for the rule of law. One law for all our people.""

In his own speech, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh blasted the Indian government under Modi, a Hindu.

Singh said the Modi-led government has been ""one of division, violence, persecution"" with a known pattern of ""attacking those who are critical"" of its actions.

WATCH | Minister says government has been 'confronting' Indian officials: LeBlanc: India's possible link to killing of Sikh leader 'an extraordinary violation of Canada's sovereignty' Duration 12:14 Minister of Public Safety Dominic LeBlanc says the government has been 'confronting' Indian officials since it became aware of 'credible allegations' a 'number of weeks ago.'

Singh said he'd use ""every tool"" at his disposal to ""bring those responsible to justice.""

""We will ensure that no rock is unturned, that every possible link is examined,"" Singh said.

He said that the public inquiry into foreign interference, which was prompted by allegations of Chinese meddling, should also look at India and its actions in Canada.

B.C. Premier David Eby said he was ""deeply disturbed and angered"" by the news.

""In light of these revelations, we will do all we can to enhance protection for the people of British Columbia against the violence or threats of state actors,"" he said in a media statement.

to remove news links in Canada in response to online news law  CBC.ca,"Google said Thursday it will remove Canadian news content from its search, news and discover products after a new law meant to compensate media outlets comes into force.

The move to pull news from the world's most popular search engine could have a devastating impact on Canadian media outlets, which often depend on third parties like Google to get content into the hands of readers.

The decision comes after the government's contentious C-18 legislation passed Parliament last week. The bill has been criticized by tech giants like Meta and Google who say it's unfair to impose what amounts to a tax on links.

Some smaller media outlets and experts have blasted the regime because they claim the bulk of the financial benefits will accrue to a handful of a large media players.

""We're disappointed it has come to this. We don't take this decision or its impacts lightly and believe it's important to be transparent with Canadian publishers and our users as early as possible,"" said Kent Walker, the president of global affairs at Google and Alphabet.

""The unprecedented decision to put a price on links (a so-called 'link tax') creates uncertainty for our products and exposes us to uncapped financial liability simply for facilitating Canadians' access to news from Canadian publishers.""

The government and larger media outlets, including the newspaper lobby group and broadcasters like the CBC and CTV, have said social media companies should compensate news outlets for the use of their content.

'Deeply irresponsible'

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez suggested Thursday he has no intention of backing down from this fight with the American web giants that control so much of what Canadians read and watch.

""Big tech would rather spend money to change their platforms to block Canadians from accessing good quality and local news instead of paying their fair share to news organizations,"" Rodriguez said in a statement.

Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez called Google's decision to eventually move Canadian news content from its site a ""deeply irresponsible"" move. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

""This shows how deeply irresponsible and out of touch they are, especially when they make billions of dollars off of Canadian users. Canada needs to have a strong, free and independent press. It's fundamental to our democracy.""

Rodriguez added in an interview with CBC News that he was surprised by Google's statement because the government's talks with the company are ongoing.

""We're still having conversations with Google as recent at this morning,"" he said. ""Google knows very well that the clarity they need is coming soon through regulation.""

Just yesterday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was confident Google would come around on the legislation.

""I will say the conversations with Google are ongoing. It is important that we find a way to ensure that Canadians can continue to access content in all sorts of ways but also that we protect rigorous independent journalism that has a foundational role in our democracies,"" he said.

""We know that democracies only work with a strong independent diverse media and we will continue to work for that.""

WATCH: Trudeau says he's 'disappointed' by Meta's reaction to online news law

Trudeau says he's 'disappointed' with Meta's threat to end access to news on Facebook, Instagram Duration 1:17 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government will continue to work with social media giants to 'ensure that Canadians can continue to function online in free and open ways.'

Meta already has said it will block Canadian news content on popular platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

Trudeau called Meta's decision ""extremely disappointing.""

""Facebook continues to refuse to accept its responsibility towards our democracy by refusing to pay its fair share,"" Trudeau said.

The bill has been pitched as a way to keep news outlets solvent after advertising moved en masse to digital platforms, virtually wiping out a major revenue stream for journalism.

The dominance over advertising once enjoyed by legacy media is over. Google and Facebook have a combined 80 per cent share of all online ad revenue in Canada and rake in an eye-popping $9.7 billion a year, according to government data.

According to government figures, more than 450 news outlets in Canada have closed since 2008 and at least one third of Canadian journalism jobs have disappeared over that same time period.

Print and digital news businesses have struggled to make money from their content after losing major revenue streams, such as classified ads and subscriptions.

In an era of cord-cutting, some private and public broadcasters also have failed to adequately monetize their airwaves to pay for local, regional and national radio and TV news.

After years of losing money, Bell Media-owned CTV recently announced deep cuts, essentially closing the company's foreign bureaus and downsizing their footprint in Ottawa and Washington, D.C.

Pointing to layoffs and a struggling news industry, Rodriguez said Thursday ""the status quo is not working."" He said the new legislation is meant to ""level the playing field by putting the power of big tech in check.""

In an attempt to reverse the revenue decline, the government's new regulatory regime will require companies like Google and the Meta-owned Facebook — and other major online platforms that reproduce or facilitate access to news content — to either pay to post content or go through a binding arbitration process led by an arms-length regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

An outlet will be considered an eligible news business if it regularly employs two or more journalists in Canada, operates largely within Canada and produces content that is edited and designed in this country.

Google and Meta have signalled they'd rather get out of the news-posting business altogether rather than deal with this process.

In a separate statement, a spokesperson for Google Canada said the government's legislation ""will make it harder for Canadians to find news online, make it harder for journalists to reach their audiences, and reduce valuable free web traffic to Canadian publishers.""

But Google signalled it may be willing to change course if the government addresses some of its concerns.

""We hope that the government will be able to outline a viable path forward,"" said Google spokesperson Shay Pardy.

CBC/Radio-Canada could be a beneficiary of this new federal program because it operates one of the largest news sites in the country and links to its content are regularly shared on other platforms.

Under the new law, CBC is required to provide an annual report on any compensation for news it receives from digital operators.

""We all depend on an open Internet. It would be unfortunate if the digital platforms used their dominance to deny Canadians access to news and information. We encourage Canadians to go directly to the websites and apps they trust for their news,"" said Leon Mar, a spokesperson for CBC/Radio Canada.

OpenMedia, an advocacy group that has attacked the bill in the past, said Thursday that Google's decision is ""exactly what we warned Heritage Minister [Pablo] Rodriguez about.""

""Unfortunately, the way this bill was written made news blocking inevitable,"" said Matt Hatfield, the group's campaigns director.

""Instead of building a much-needed sustainable funding model that would support quality and diverse news, C-18's failures will make it even more difficult for Canadians to access the news they need on the platforms they use.""

Michael Geist is a Canada research chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa and a fierce critic of the bill.

He said Rodriguez, the minister who shepherded this legislation through Parliament, ""did not take risks of the flawed Bill C-18 seriously.""

Geist said the minister is ""squarely to blame"" for Google's decision, which risks imperilling an already fragile industry.

""Cannot overstate the harm from this: news sector loses hundreds of millions, Canadians face degraded search results, and prominence of low-quality sources increase,"" Geist tweeted.

In a media statement, the NDP was scathing in its criticism of Google.

The party's heritage critic, Peter Julian, said ""multibillionaire web giants"" like Google and Meta are ""playing games"" with the future of Canadian media, something he called a ""shameful"" practice akin to ""bullying.""

""When the time comes to draw the line and ask them to pay their fair share, Meta and Google resort to bullying tactics showing Canadians their true colours: if they don't like the rules, they won't follow them — even if those rules are in place to protect good quality journalism and Canadians,"" Julian said.

Julian said the same companies now threatening to block news content have been slow to root out the disinformation and ""hate speech"" that regularly circulates on their platforms.

They're throwing their weight around now, Julian said, and trying to stop a bill that ""enhances fairness in the news market.""

news site The Post Millennial blurs line between journalism and conservative 'pamphleteering'  CBC News,"The founders of The Post Millennial have big plans. In the next two years, they want to turn the once-obscure website they describe as a ""centre-right"" outlet into a news powerhouse that competes with legacy media across Canada and the United States.

On its About page, the site dubs itself ""your reasonable alternative,"" with a mission to ""accurately and adequately report Canadian news events as they unfold and progress.""

But a CBC/Radio-Canada investigation found poor transparency around its political ties — for one thing, many of its writers have openly campaigned for conservative politicians — and unanswered questions about its journalistic standards and funding model.

The site covers national and regional news, as well as some sports and culture stories, and has a robust opinion section that features major conservative voices including Barbara Kay and Spencer Fernando.

The site has been around since 2017, but its journey from obscurity began in June 2018. Over the next year, its Facebook page went from 36,000 monthly interactions to over 194,000 in May 2019, according to social media tool BuzzSumo. The amount of content posted on Facebook also jumped, from 198 posts in June 2018 to 428 in May 2019.

This screengrab from social media tool BuzzSumo shows the most popular stories posted on The Post Millennial over the last 12 months.

Even though its Facebook page has relatively few subscribers — around 26,000 — The Post Millennial's engagement there has surpassed other right-leaning media sites, like The Rebel, which boasts more than 182,000 subscribers on Facebook.

Recently, The Post Millennial has been angling for more recognition and legitimacy. The site adopted a statement of journalistic principles late last year, formalized a masthead and applied to have one of its reporters become a member of the Parliamentary press gallery.

The outlet is also expanding, with a new office in Montreal, another planned in Toronto and a six-figure broadcast studio in the works.

The Post Millennial's audience is growing, but the site's success is increasing scrutiny of its practices, and the political ties of its staff. Seyed Ali Taghva, editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Post Millennial, said the site is unabashedly a ""centre-right news organization, the same way the Toronto Star is a liberal news organization.""

But Alan Conter, a professor of journalism at Concordia University in Montreal, said the content skews more pro-conservative than centre-right.

""They're upfront about their politics, in a way. You'd have to be living under a rock to think that they were aiming to be somewhere in the centre,"" Conter said.

But he said that transparency is key. ""There would be an issue if a reporter is not transparent about his previous political roles or if those roles are ongoing. If he's continuing to be active in political circles, that should be explicit.""

Ties to conservative politicians

Since its inception, the Post Millennial has consistently published coverage critical of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Headlines appearing in the news section include: ""Trudeau's economy is a total failure,"" ""Trudeau Liberals threaten free speech with hints of reviving Section 13"" and ""The 'blame Stephen Harper' game won't fool Canadians on Trudeau's immigration and asylum failure.""

The site has published op-eds from eight Members of Parliament, all of whom are members of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC). The columns cover topics ranging from religious freedom to data privacy.

Taghva said the site doesn't solicit columns from specific MPs, and would welcome submissions from politicians of any stripe.

Several contributors who write under the ""Canadian News"" banner — not the opinion section — have been involved with the federal Conservative Party or with provincial counterparts.

One example: Yaakov ""Yanky"" Pollak, who ran the Facebook page for the CPC's Outremont riding and campaigned for Jasmine Louras, the riding's CPC candidate, in January of this year. Pollak also runs a Facebook page and website called Elect Conservatives, which claims to have no ties to the CPC.

This February 2019 tweet from Yaakov Pollak references his efforts door-knocking for Conservative candidate Jasmine Louras. Pollak was writing for The Post Millennial at the time. (Yanky_Pollak/Twitter)

On social media, Pollak has regularly appeared in pictures with Conservative MPs and was invited to celebrate Hannukah with Andrew Scheer at his official residence in December 2018.

Pollak told CBC-Radio Canada he is a member of the CPC, but didn't see it as a conflict of interest.

""Many journalists and photographers hold memberships to political parties,"" Pollak wrote in an email. ""It doesn't mean that they can't objectively assess and report facts, or hold opinions on issues.""

Conter disagreed with Pollak's explanation. ""Generally speaking, reporters are not active members of a political party.""

Taghva brushed off the notion that there is a conflict of interest, because he said Pollak is not a full-time staffer and mostly rewrites stories published by other sites.

Another reporter, Alex Singh Dhaliwal, wrote an article about Alberta Premier Jason Kenney entitled, ""Kenney pledges to bring 'good jobs' back to Alberta."" The piece was labelled ""Alberta News"" and written like a regular news article, even though Dhaliwal's bio on the site indicates he was involved in campaigning for the United Conservative Party, Kenney's party, in the recent provincial election.

Taghva said he's largely unconcerned with perceived bias of his writers, again citing the Toronto Star.

""Have you checked out the Toronto Star's Wikipedia page? Right underneath [the name] it says their value is liberalism,"" he said. ""The paper has a worldview like every single paper in this country. I dare you to find one that doesn't have a worldview. But we're very open about it, and we're hiring people from across the aisle.""

Tim Groeling, a communications professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who researches political bias in media, said the site's partisanship is evident from its story selection, so the fact that many of its writers have been involved in campaigns shouldn't be surprising.

""When I looked at the site, I could tell within five seconds that it leaned right,"" Groeling said. ""Once you already have [writers] established as partisan, then donations or voluntary activity where they're supporting a candidate, I think, are probably a grey area.""

Separating fact from feeling

Other sites with partisan sympathies have cropped up in the last few years, like the more left-leaning North99 or PressProgress, but the Post Millennial stands apart for its size and ambition. Taghva, and co-founder Matthew Azrieli, also previously ran a sister site, The Nectarine, with a similar conservative lean, though they shut it down this year to focus on growing the Post Millennial.

Much of the content on The Post Millennial blurs the line between opinion and news, something Taghva chalked up to the growing pains of being a small, young site. He encouraged readers to flag anything they think is mislabelled, and said they will work to correct it.

Last fall, the site adopted a journalism ethics policy that states ""the separation of news columns from editorial pages is essential."" This policy also claims that ""its staff are pledged to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest wherever and whenever possible.""

Both of those lines appear to have been copied from The Washington Post's Policies and Standards. In fact, The Post Millennial's ethics policy appears to have been largely plagiarized from other media sources. Approximately 75 per cent of the language in the policy is identical to declarations of principles from The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Globe and Mail and Torstar publications.

The language used in The Post Millennial's ethical standards, left, is identical to passages in others publications' guidelines, such as this section from The New York Times, right. (Philippe Tardif/Radio-Canada)

""I mean, it can be identical, but is the point correct?"" Taghva said in response. ""I don't think anyone cares as long as the actual rules make sense. The ethical journalism standards are meant to be the rules we follow. I would imagine that people would be happier that they're very, very similar to the mainstream media's.""

In May 2019, the site brought on a new executive : Jeff Ballingall. A former political staffer, Ballingall has been credited with helping Ontario Premier Doug Ford win the 2018 election, thanks to his third-party advertising group, Ontario Proud .

Ballingall runs a network of Proud pages (including a national version called Canada Proud), all of which are registered as third-party advertisers. Post Millennial stories are frequently shared on the Proud network of Facebook pages.

Ballingall is listed as The Post Millennial's chief marketing officer. When contacted by CBC-Radio Canada, Ballingall said he did not speak publicly for the company and directed questions to Taghva, who said that Ballingall has no control over editorial content and is strictly involved in branding and marketing for the site.

'They claim to be journalists'

The statement announcing Ballingall's hire also revealed that The Post Millennial received funding from ""private investors."" Taghva would not reveal who the investors were or how much funding the site received.

Aside from the private investment, it's unclear how The Post Millennial makes money to fund the operation. Taghva said the site generates revenue through subscriptions and advertisements, but would not say how many paying subscribers the site has.

The website also does not display any ads. When asked about this, Taghva said they had recently removed the ads in anticipation of a paywall they're planning to put in place.

Although the site's founders bill it as an alternative to Canada's legacy newsrooms, much of the site's content relies on the very media outlets they claim to be countering.

For example, a recent story about China suspending the import of Canadian beef relied on a story from CBC News (which The Post Millennial misidentified as the Canadian Press), and does not include any original reporting.

""They claim to be journalists, but they mostly aggregate stuff from other sources and then do op-eds on it,"" said Conter. ""They're perfectly within their rights to be publishing what they're doing, of course. But I would say it's less journalism and more pamphleteering.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

to rebuild defence early-warning system means political, fiscal headaches for Trudeau government  CBC News","It's not the SHIELD you're probably thinking of — the one with the super-spies and flying battleships from Marvel comics and movies.

In fact, the SHIELD at the centre of the upcoming evolution of NORAD — the six-decade-old North American defence pact — shares nothing with its fictional counterpart but the acronym. But those trying to sell pandemic-weary, deficit-swamped governments on the proposed Strategic Homeland Integrated Ecosystem for Layered Defense may be hoping for a little reflected glamour for their multi-billion-dollar idea.

The current Liberal government committed to the renewal of NORAD early on; it was the top item in the first meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and now-former U.S. president Donald Trump in 2017. The proposal now presents a host of thorny political and financial problems for Canada.

The SHIELD concept is not your grandfather's version of NORAD — which was simply a chain of radar stations across the North primed to warn of approaching Russian bombers and missiles.

A NORAD for now

The new strategy was first sketched out last fall in a paper written for the Wilson Center's Canada Institute by the former U.S. NORAD commander, retired general Terrence O'Shaughnessy, and U.S. Air Force Brig.-Gen. Peter Fesler, the current deputy director of operations at the U.S. air defence headquarters.

Fesler and O'Shaughnessy argued that, faced with a variety of new and improved weapons — everything from hypersonic glide vehicles to next-generation cruise missiles — North America needs a defence surveillance system that knits together space, air and land-based surveillance in real time.

Such a system ""pools this data and fuses it into a common operational picture,"" said the paper, published last September. ""Then, using the latest advances in machine learning and data analysis, it scans the data for patterns that are not visible to human eyes, helping decision-makers understand adversary potential courses of action before they are executed.""

What they're talking about is predictive analysis and artificial intelligence. The SHIELD concept envisions a ""global sensing grid"" that can sniff out threats as they develop by drawing on data from ""traditional and nontraditional sources,"" such as civilian air traffic control grids.

To an extent, the SHIELD concept is being put to work already by NORAD through operational testing of a cloud-based data fusion system called Project Pathfinder.

A hard sell

The U.S. Air Force signed off on the Pathfinder prototype and has ordered a production model through an $8 million US contract, according to Air Force Magazine.

The NORAD refurbishment was never costed in the federal government's 2017 defence policy and it presents a host of challenges and tough decisions for the Liberal government now, ranging from the fiscal to the political to the military.

The arrival of the Biden administration in Washington seems to have made government-to-government negotiations more politically palatable in Ottawa. Many in Canada's defence community were convinced there was little appetite among federal officials to haggle with Trump over NORAD after the bruising experience of re-negotiating the NAFTA trade deal.

One of the first challenges for government officials will be to present the NORAD renewal project to a Canadian public and political establishment overwhelmed by the pandemic, said one defence expert.

An economic argument

""If you try to quickly sell this in the context of 'the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming,' that is politically problematic, I think, particularly for this government,"" said James Fergusson, deputy director of the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at the University of Manitoba.

Framing it in economic terms — highlighting the opportunities for innovation and high-tech jobs — likely would help, he said, but the overall cost will be an issue given the damage done to the economy and government balance sheets by the pandemic.

Estimates of the cost of NORAD's renewal range between $11 billion and $15 billion. Whatever it ends up costing, Canadian taxpayers would be on the hook for 40 per cent of the total.

The price tag is ""the elephant in the room,"" said Fergusson, adding that he's skeptical about the assurances he's heard from senior government officials that the money for NORAD will be in addition to already-promised defence policy funding.

Belt-tightening and BMD

He said he attended a conference in Ottawa a year ago that heard a senior Department of National Defence (DND) official state that the department had ""been promised we're going to get extra money for NORAD ...""

""No, you're not,"" Fergusson added.

He said he believes it's more likely that DND will be asked to cover Canada's NORAD contribution within its existing budget — forcing the department to make cuts elsewhere.

The NORAD project also promises to drag a reluctant federal government back into a political debate over ballistic missile defence (BMD).

The recent Liberal defence policy reaffirmed the 2005 decision by Paul Martin's government to remain on the sidelines of any continental BMD effort, despite pleas from both the Senate and House of Commons defence committees to reconsider joining.

BMD is a non-starter for New Democrats and for some experts in the defence community who argue that missile defence merely contributes to the arms race.

Fergusson said recent advances in technology and military doctrine may force the government's hand.

""The United States is moving very quickly to integrate air and missile defence into single units, rather than have them separated,"" he said. ""So that has big implications for us. We can't simply do air defence without having to work with or having to do missile defence.""

And embedded in the concept of a ""global sensing grid"" is the expectation that threats — once identified — would be taken out.

Instead of focusing on the missiles — the ""arrows,"" to use NORAD parlance — the expectation is that a defensive network would focus its response on the ""archers,"" or the launch platforms. Russian bombers circling far outside of North American airspace, for example, would be targeted under the SHIELD strategy.

""That will be unpalatable to the Canadian government,"" said Fergusson, pointing out that the Canadian military doesn't have the long-range capability to conduct those kinds of defensive operations.

It's a conversation Canada can't avoid for much longer, he said, because much of the existing North Warning System reaches the end of its operational life by 2024.

""The United States cannot defend itself without Canada and we can't defend ourselves without the United States.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

party says  CBC News","Jerry Bance was service technician when caught on CBC-TV's Marketplace in 2012 urinating in mug and dumping contents into sink

A service technician caught on hidden camera urinating into a coffee mug during a 2012 house call to repair a leaky sink before he became a Conservative election candidate is no longer running, the Tories said today.

Jerry Bance ""is no longer a candidate,"" said Conservative spokesman Stephen Lecce in a brief email to CBC News on Monday.

Lecce later confirmed to CBC News that Bance was dropped for not being truthful during the candidate screening process.

Lecce did not provide any further details, such as who might replace Bance as Conservative candidate in the Toronto-area battleground riding of Scarborough–Rouge Park.

Bance was filmed during an episode of CBC-TV's investigative series Marketplace. He is seen peeing into a coffee cup before dumping its contents into the sink he was supposed to be fixing.

Jerry Bance was the Conservative candidate in Scarborough-Rouge Park, until he was identified as the repair technician caught on camera peeing in a customer's coffee mug in a 2012 CBC Marketplace sting. (Conservative.ca)

A service technician for the last 25 years, he had been called to the home as part of a sting operation to catch and confront repairmen overcharging homeowners for simple repairs to home appliances. Hidden cameras captured the incident, which occurred while a Marketplace producer posing as a homeowner was in the next room.

Bance had also run as a Conservative in 2006 and 2008. Jason Kenney, the high-profile Conservative minister and candidate from Alberta, helped him kick off his current campaign last week.

The original Marketplace episode had referred to Bance — who owns and operates XPress Appliance Service, an appliance repair company in the Greater Toronto Area — only as ""Jerry."" A tip received by CBC News late Sunday night pointed out Jerry is Bance.

The Tories' split with Bance was followed just hours later by news that the party had dropped another Toronto candidate, Tim Dutaud, after YouTube videos surfaced of Dutaud making prank phone calls that included derogatory comments about people with disabilities.

Speaking during a campaign stop in Toronto Monday afternoon, Conservative Leader Stephen Harper faced questions from media about both candidates but offered little in response.

""What this says is that we keep the highest standards for candidates and that these two individuals are no longer candidates,"" he said.

In a statement released Sunday evening, Bance said ""the footage from that day does not reflect who I am as a professional or a person.

This must be someone who's adept at Stephen Harper's trickle-down theory of economics. - NDP Leader Tom Mulcair

""I deeply regret my actions on that day.""

Response to the story on social media sites was nearly instantaneous. The hashtag ""peegate"" was soon trending on Twitter, as Twitter buzzed with disparaging jokes, comments and bad puns targeting Bance and the Conservative Party.

The Conservatives' political rivals took the opportunity to make a few jokes at Bance's expense.

""I guess that this was one mugshot that Canadians weren't expecting from the Conservatives,"" said NDP Leader Tom Mulcair.

Mulcair was speaking to reporters at the annual Labour Day parade in Toronto, where he's spending the day campaigning for the Oct. 19 vote.

Tom Mulcair has some fun with latest Conservative resignation Duration 0:27 NDP Leader Tom Mulcair cracks a couple of jokes over the resignation of a conservative candidate who had been caught on camera urinating into a coffee mug while he worked as a service technician.

""This must be someone who's adept at Stephen Harper's trickle-down theory of economics,"" Mulcair said smirking. ""Any other questions?""

Speaking Monday evening at a campaign event in Summerside, P.E.I., Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said the incidents show Harper is out of touch and ""didn't bother"" to find out the past of two of his candidates.

""And he lost them today,"" Trudeau said of the candidates, before slipping in a barb to the local crowd over suspended Senator Mike Duffy's residency troubles.

""But really, is that something so surprising from a man who still believes Mike Duffy is a Prince Edward Islander?""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

investigating massive security breach at Global Affairs Canada  CBC.ca,"Canadian authorities are investigating a prolonged data security breach following the ""detection of malicious cyber activity"" affecting the internal network used by Global Affairs Canada staff, according to internal department emails viewed by CBC News.

The breach affects at least two internal drives, as well as emails, calendars and contacts of many staff members.

CBC News spoke to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, including employees who have received instructions on how the breach affects their ability to work. Some were told to stop working remotely as of last Wednesday.

CBC News has also seen three internal emails sent to Global Affairs staff.

""Forensic work has also progressed to help us understand the scope of the data breach,"" one email said. ""The work is ongoing, but early results suggest that many (Global Affairs Canada) users may have been affected.""

Another email said the internal systems were vulnerable between December 20, 2023 and January 24, 2024. It informed anyone who connected remotely using a SIGNET (Secure Integrated Global Network) laptop that their information may be vulnerable.

The ""compromised"" system was the virtual private network (VPN) staff use to access Global Affairs's Ottawa headquarters. The VPN system was managed by Shared Services Canada, the GAC notice said.

Shared Services Canada is a federal department created in 2011 to take over the delivery of email, data centres and network services for many government departments and agencies.

Global Affairs Canada confirms breach

In a statement issued Tuesday, Global Affairs Canada said an ""unplanned IT outage"" is affecting remote access to its network. The department said the partial outage was activated intentionally on Jan. 24 to ""address the discovery of malicious cyber activity.""

""Early results indicate there has been a data breach and that there has been unauthorized access to personal information of users including employees,"" the statement said, adding that the department is investigating the matter and contacting those affected to ensure their information is secure.

The statement also said connectivity in GAC buildings is fully functioning and that employees working remotely in Canada have been provided with workarounds.

""The department's critical services and external communication channels remain accessible and operational.""

No word yet on scope of data breach

According to Global Affairs, SIGNET is the department's secure computer network. One part of the network holds personal information on shared drives, including employees' personal information. Another part holds classified information.

It's not clear whether secret information was lost in the breach, which lasted longer than a month. It's also not clear who was behind the breach.

Email traffic and files on personal and shared drives ""may have been compromised,"" a GAC memo to staff said. GAC also said it's looking into whether ""sensitive corporate information,"" such as credit cards and banking data, may have been breached.

WATCH | Authorities investigate data security breach at Global Affairs Canada: Authorities investigating massive security breach at Global Affairs Canada Duration 2:00 Authorities are investigating a major data security breach Global Affairs Canada that included 'unauthorized access to the personal information of users, including employees.'

Shared Services Canada and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security — which is part of the Communications Security Establishment, Canada's cyber-security organization — are investigating the breach, GAC's email to staff said.

""Forensic work, including with these partners, is ongoing to help us understand the impact on our networks and any potential changes in the scope and in the time frame of the data breach,"" the GAC email to staff read.

The office of the Privacy Commissioner said Global Affairs Canada informed it of a data breach on Jan. 26.

""We are in ongoing communication with the department to gather more information,"" a spokesman said in a media statement. ""Following a breach notification, our office will work with federal institutions to better understand privacy risks related to the breach and ensure that the department undertakes appropriate steps, including notification of affected individuals.""

Global Affairs is a 'natural target'

""A breach of that duration is bound to be serious,"" said Wesley Wark, a national security expert at the University of Ottawa.

""Global Affairs Canada holds a lot of classified and sensitive information ... It is a natural target for hacking but it's also vulnerable and holds important data.""

Although sensitive diplomatic cables are sent using an encrypted system, a source told CBC News that some drafts of sensitive correspondence and some intelligence may have been stored in the affected drives.

""We know this information may be unsettling for many of you,"" said the email sent to staff. ""This is an evolving situation and further information and guidance will continue to be shared as quickly as possible.""

The email offers suggestions on how to safeguard ""sensitive information"" and encourages employees to monitor financial accounts in case of unauthorized activity.

In the interim, some Canada-based Global Affairs employees with security clearance are not able to work from home.

""This is not a permanent change to the hybrid work model, just a temporary situation until this crisis passes,"" the email said.

A senior diplomatic source told CBC News that on several occasions in the past year, staff were told to immediately change passwords or reboot software but were not given any further details.

Global Affairs said it's working with Shared Services Canada and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, which is part of the Communications Security Establishment, to restore full connectivity ""as soon as possible.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

planes and trains to end on Oct. 1  CBC News","The federal government says it's dropping all COVID-19 measures at borders on Saturday, meaning travellers will no longer need to provide proof of vaccination when entering Canada or wear masks on planes and trains.

As of Oct. 1, all travellers, regardless of citizenship, will no longer have to:

Submit public health information through the ArriveCAN app or website;

Provide proof of vaccination;

Undergo pre- or on-arrival testing;

Carry out COVID-19-related quarantine or isolation;

Monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms of COVID-19 upon arriving to Canada;

Undergo health checks for travel on air and rail;

Or wear masks on planes and trains.

Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Monday's decision is not a sign Canada is out of the pandemic, but said the government's data showed the importation of new variants was no longer having an effect on the evolution of the virus in country.

WATCH | Canada drops masks on planes and trains:

Canada dropping COVID-19 travel rules including masks Duration 1:59 The federal government has announced that travellers will no longer need to provide proof of vaccination when entering Canada or wear masks on planes and trains starting on Oct. 1.

""If anybody believes the pandemic is over, I invite them to visit a hospital,"" he said.

""That decision again was driven by the evidence that we have seen over the last few weeks and months, which is that the transmission and cost of transmission of COVID-19 on our health-care workers, hospitals and including those patients who have seen backlogs in their surgeries and treatments over the last two years and a half ... are now almost entirely driven by domestic transmission of COVID-19. That's where we need to invest our energy.""

The measures also apply to cruise ships so passengers will no longer be required to take pre-board tests, be vaccinated or use ArriveCAN. The government said guidelines will remain in place to protect passengers and crew, keeping in step with the United States.

The move comes after MPs and border-city mayors published an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden last week asking them to end the ""unnecessary"" rules at the border, a move they say would allow border communities to recover economically from the pandemic.

On Monday, Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati said he's glad the federal government is dropping all pandemic border measures but fears American tourists will continue to bypass Canada in the future.

""This should have happened at the beginning of the tourism season. We were devastated here in Niagara Falls,"" he said.

""A lot of the travelling public have decided to go elsewhere this past summer. Our concern is that they enjoyed it and want to continue it.""

The head of the Canadian Airports Council said the organization is relieved to know its members can return to normal operations.

""The aviation industry was hard-hit over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and has been forced to operate under a complicated and constantly shifting series of restrictions and regulations for over two years,"" said president Monette Pasher in a media statement.

COVID-19 border measures dropped 'a little late:' Niagara Falls mayor Duration 5:53 Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati says he's glad the federal government is dropping all pandemic border measures, but is worried American tourists will continue to bypass Canada in the future.

Duclos said those concerns also weighed on the government's decision to lift the measures.

""When making those decisions, we are mindful of the challenges and the cost that border communities have been facing over the last few weeks and months. It has been hard for them,"" he said.

""My colleagues and all members of our caucus have felt that and listened to them.""

The health minister didn't rule out reinstating restrictions if they are needed to keep Canadians safe.

Masks still recommended: Njoo

While masks will soon no longer be mandatory, Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief health officer, said he still recommends that people wear masks on planes and trains.

""The science is clear: wearing a mask is clearly a means of personal protection that is extremely effective,"" he said.

""I hope Canadians will make an enlightened decision about this.""

WATCH | One of Canada's top doctors urges Canadians to keep wearing masks:

One of Canada's top doctors encourages continued masking Duration 1:09 Dr. Howard Njoo, the deputy chief public health officer of Canada, urges Canadians to continue wearing masks in 'certain contexts' despite the latest removal of mask mandates.

Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said the ArriveCan app can still be used by travellers to submit customs declarations in advance at major airports. That option is available at international airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, but there are plans to expand to airports in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Quebec City, Halifax and the Billy Bishop airport in Toronto.

The government also said the Canada Border Services Agency is looking at adding features to ArriveCan, like border wait times.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was quick to claim the decision as a victory.

""After constant pressure from Conservatives [and] people across Canada, Trudeau Liberals finally back down on the disastrous ArriveCAN app, unscientific vaccine mandates and forced mask-wearing,"" he tweeted Monday.

""None of the science changes October 1 but because of you, Trudeau has to. Let's keep it up.""

of China-linked donation  CBC.ca","The Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation's president and board of directors have resigned en masse, citing the charity's entanglement in the ongoing foreign interference controversy.

In a statement, the foundation said that a $200,000 donation in 2016 from a businessman linked to the Chinese government ""has put a great deal of pressure on the foundation's management and volunteer board of directors, as well as on our staff and our community.""

The charity announced last month that it would return the donation. The Conservatives criticized the government over the matter, saying the donation compromised a government report on the integrity of the 2021 federal election.

""The circumstances created by the politicization of the foundation have made it impossible to continue with the status quo, and the volunteer board of directors has resigned, as has the president and CEO,"" the statement said.

WATCH | CEO, board of directors at Trudeau Foundation resign en masse: Mass exodus at Trudeau foundation over ‘politicization’ Duration 2:36 The president and entire board of directors at the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation resigned Tuesday over what they call ‘politicization,’ partly linked to a 2016 donation from a Chinese donor.

The foundation is independent and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has no involvement with it.

""The Trudeau Foundation is a foundation with which I have absolutely no intersection,"" Trudeau told a news conference Tuesday.

""It is a shame to see the level of toxicity and political polarization that is going on in our country these days, but I am certain that the Trudeau Foundation will be able to continue to ensure that research into the social studies and humanities at the highest levels across Canadian academic institutions continues for many years to come.""

The charity, established in 2001 to honour former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, funds scholarships, mentorships and fellowships.

Statement from the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation - Resignation of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO<a href=""https://t.co/q3iT3KwpUQ"">https://t.co/q3iT3KwpUQ</a> <a href=""https://t.co/e3O9xn4SY4"">pic.twitter.com/e3O9xn4SY4</a> —@fdnPETF

Last month, Prime Minister Trudeau appointed former governor general David Johnston as a special rapporteur to investigate foreign interference in Canadian elections and institutions, including alleged meddling by the Chinese government.

The Conservatives have questioned Johnston's impartiality, in part by pointing to Johnston's former role as a member of the Trudeau Foundation. Foundation members are responsible for appointing the board of directors.

Johnston resigned from the foundation following his appointment as special rapporteur. Trudeau has defended the choice, citing Johnston's long career in public service.

The statement said three directors will remain on an interim basis to continue the charity's work while a new board is appointed. The foundation's website currently lists six members of the board of directors.

Its president and CEO, Pascale Fournier, had been in the position for almost five years.

Poilievre calls for investigation

Reacting to news of the resignations Tuesday morning, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called for an investigation into the charity.

""We need to investigate the Beijing-funded Trudeau Foundation,"" Poilievre tweeted.

""We need to know who got rich, who got paid and who got privilege and power from Justin Trudeau as a result of funding to the Trudeau Foundation.""

Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said the resignations make the 2016 donation look more suspicious. He called on Johnston to step down as special rapporteur and for the government to call a public inquiry into foreign interference.

""Nothing else will do,"" Blanchet said in a French statement.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he won't comment on the Trudeau Foundation specifically. He repeated his calls for a public inquiry.

A statement from the foundation said ‘the circumstances created by the politicization of the foundation have made it impossible to continue with the status quo.’

""What we've seen from both the Liberals and the Conservatives, they're more interested in scoring political points, pointing fingers at each other,"" Singh told a news conference.

430,000 in Q3  CBC.ca","Canada's population grew by more than 430,000 during the third quarter, marking the fastest pace of population growth in any quarter since 1957.

Statistics Canada released its Oct. 1 population estimates on Tuesday, putting the number at more than 40.5 million.

The agency says the population growth over the first nine months of 2023 has already surpassed the total growth in any other full year, including the record set in 2022.

That has been fuelled by international migration, including about 313,000 non-permanent residents who came to the country from July to September.

StatsCan says those non-permanent residents were mostly work and study permit-holders, and to a lesser extent refugee claimants.

Experts have been warning that the strong pace of population growth in Canada is eroding housing affordability, given the country has struggled to ramp up home construction.

Earlier this month, Bank of Canada deputy governor Toni Gravelle gave a speech on the effect of immigration on the economy and inflation in particular.

Gravelle acknowledged there are many benefits to this rise in immigration, noting it has helped grow the economy, expand the workforce and counteract an aging population.

But he warned it's also adding pressure to a housing market riddled with challenges, including zoning restrictions and a shortage of construction workers.

WATCH | Immigration drives Canada's population to 40M Immigration drives Canada's population to 40M Duration 1:52 Canada's population has hit 40 million people. The historic pace of the increase is being driven by immigration and the need for workers, but it's also causing the already dire housing crisis to get even worse.

""This jump in demographic demand coupled with the existing structural supply issues could explain why rent inflation continues to climb in Canada. It also helps explain, in part, why housing prices have not fallen as much as we had expected,"" Gravelle told the Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce.

Polling suggests Canadians are quite concerned about the impact immigration is having on infrastructure and services in the country.

In a Leger poll last month, about three-quarters of respondents agreed the increase in immigrants is adding strain to both the housing market and health-care system.

Compared to March 2022, the percentage of Canadians who said they want the country to welcome more immigrants than it has in the past had fallen from 17 per cent to nine per cent.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

is Canada's worst airline when it comes to passenger complaints, federal data shows  CBC News","Ultra low-cost carrier Flair is Canada's worst airline for complaints, with more than 20 per cent of its flights generating some sort of complaint to the Canadian Transport Agency (CTA), new federal data shows.

While gripes about air travel are not unusual, the CTA, the quasi-judicial body that regulates air transportation, found Flair had the dubious distinction of trailing all other major carriers on customer satisfaction in the first quarter of 2023.

In the January-March period, the CTA received 20.9 complaints for every 100 Flair flights. That compares to 10.7 for WestJet and 5.8 for Air Canada.

Other low-cost carriers — which generally charge less for fares, only to add on ancillary fees for things like seat selection, baggage and live-agent customer service — performed better than Flair despite a similar business model.

Lynx, a fledgling Calgary-based carrier, had 5.2 complaints per 100 flights.

Sunwing, a leisure airline that was recently acquired by WestJet, was the second-worst carrier for complaints after Flair — it generated 17.4 complaints for every 100 flights, said the CTA. Swoop, WestJet's discount sister brand, was the subject of 16 complaints per 100 flights.

Flair's poor showing doesn't come as a surprise to some of its customers.

There's a dedicated Facebook group — Flair Airlines Nightmares — that has over 10,000 members who trade horror stories about flying with the carrier.

The complaints are different but there's one common thread: lacklustre or non-existent customer service.

Passengers are often grappling with last-minute flight cancellations, hours-long delays, lost bags and rebooked flights that are days or weeks out from the original date of departure.

Sometimes, Flair has put passengers on planes headed to airports that were not their original destinations.

What's unique about Flair, passengers say, is its inadequate level of communication.

Third-party contract airport workers are powerless to help with some issues.

Call centre wait times are particularly egregious, passengers claim. Customer complaints are usually handled by email.

Passengers are often directed to an automated chatbot on the airline's website, a tool disgruntled Flair travellers say is essentially useless.

What's missing is adequate access to a real person who can actually help solve a problem, Flair customers say.

Ken Elmes was one of those unlucky travellers.

'The whole thing is a mess'

In an interview with CBC News, Elmes recounted being stranded in Saint John, N.B. His flight from Toronto went off without a hitch — the return was a different story.

The flight home was cancelled at the last minute, he said. Elmes and his wife were automatically rebooked on a flight ten days later.

""We're like, what? Ten days? I'd never even heard of that. That's completely unacceptable,"" Elmes said.

A trip to the airport didn't solve their problem — an overworked reservation agent dealing with a group of irate passengers told Elmes she couldn't change the reservation.

""I feel sorry for their workers — she told us this happens all the time,"" he said. ""This airline, it's just not professional at all. The whole thing is a mess.""

After spending hours on hold with Flair's call centre — and realizing that other airlines were sold out on the Saint John-Toronto route — Elmes rented a one-way car rental and drove across the country to get home rather than wait for Flair to come through.

That set him back a cool $1,500 — many times more than what he paid for the airfare.

Elmes, a retiree on a fixed income, said it was an unnecessary hit to the wallet that still stings seven weeks after he got back.

He said Flair initially offered some compensation — it agreed to $688.68 — only to later renege, claiming it didn't owe him anything.

""They need to clean up their act. The transport minister, Omar Alghabra, he's got to do something,"" Elmes said. ""One thing is for sure, I'll absolutely never fly Flair again.""

While executives from Air Canada, WestJet and Sunwing were hauled before a House of Commons committee earlier this year to account for the disastrous state of air travel over Christmas, Flair's leaders weren't on the witness list.

That's not because it had a sterling record over the holidays.

In the October-December 2022 period, Flair was second only to Sunwing — which stranded hundreds of passengers in Mexico over the holidays — in terms of complaints to the CTA.

In fact, since the CTA started publishing data, Flair has always been either the first- or second-worst airline for reported complaints.

'Am I going to be stranded?'

Blane Johnson, a sales representative from Meaford, Ont., has a story to tell about Flair's mismanagement.

He said his trip to Florida was ruined after a series of flight delays left him and his brother waiting hours at the airport.

They could cope with the nine-hour delay, he said, but the main issue was Flair's abrupt decision to rebook Kitchener-bound passengers on a Toronto flight with no other option to get out of Orlando.

""They sent me to a completely different city. Toronto — that's really quite far from Kitchener,"" he said. ""So, I'm sitting there thinking, am I going to be stranded in Toronto for the night? I'm from the country, I didn't know if anyone was willing to drive me in the middle of the night.""

Luckily, an Uber was willing to make the trip to the Kitchener airport so he and his brother could pick up their stranded vehicle for the drive back to their final destination on the shores of Lake Huron.

Under air passenger protection regulations, delayed passengers like Johnson are entitled to some compensation.

He said he tried to get Flair to at least cover part of his Uber. He was offered a meagre amount. Now he's gone to the CTA to fight for more money.

He'll be waiting a while. The CTA is overwhelmed with complaints from air passengers, with more than 46,000 cases currently in the queue.

The rocky post-COVID restart to air travel prompted an avalanche of complaints, forcing the CTA to warn travellers it will take at least 18 months for a complaint to be reviewed.

'Not worth the headache'

That's a timeline that the government itself has said is unacceptable.

""Flair just doesn't act like a professional organization. I would never fly them again. It's not worth the headache,"" Johnson said.

Vianney Godbout is a Montreal-area real estate agent.

After an enjoyable cruise through Alaska, Godbout was booked to fly home on Flair from Vancouver. There were hours-long delays, he said, but the flight did eventually take off.

Godbout's problem is that he still hasn't received his baggage. He said he's been waiting for more than two weeks.

Godbout didn't just have clothes and toiletries in that suitcase. The airline has misplaced the CPAP machine he needs to sleep and his pricey MacBook laptop.

Flair has been ""useless"" and has been giving him the runaround or simply ignoring his requests for a status update, he said.

He said he's sent more than 25 emails, made countless calls with hours-long wait times and Flair still hasn't delivered the bag.

""It's pretty sad,"" he told CBC News. ""I've been promised a call from a superior every single day. I've never received a call. We have no clue where that bag is.

""Air Canada, WestJet — they're not great. But at least I could speak to someone. Flair, they just don't give a shit. Flair is the worst ever. That was my first and last experience with Flair.""

Flair defended its record in an emailed statement.

Last month, a Flair spokesperson said, the airline flew over 436,000 passengers with 82.1 per cent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time.

""We want every passenger to have a great experience with the airline, and the majority of our passengers do,"" a spokesperson for the airline said.

""In the last several months, we have taken concrete steps to improve our responsiveness to customers in our communication channels, and the result is more responsive communications, and faster and successful resolution of customer inquiries.""

Flair has been dogged by controversy since it transitioned in 2019-2020 from a charter and cargo carrier to an airline that runs regularly scheduled passenger flights.

Its ownership structure — U.S. interests own part of the company — has raised eyebrows at the CTA.

Last year, the regulator threatened to pull the airline's licence before eventually backing down after Flair insisted it's a Canadian-owned company, as the law requires.

Aircraft lessors have also confiscated some of Flair's planes after they alleged the Edmonton-based airline missed some payments.

In March, the Ottawa airport cut ties with Menzies, the company that provides airport services for Flair, because it said the service was bad.

The CTA data on Flair and other carriers also doesn't tell the whole story about the state of customer satisfaction — there are likely many more disgruntled air passengers who haven't bothered to go to the regulator with a complaint.

The CTA will only accept a complaint after a traveller has tried to resolve their issue directly with the airline. A complainant must wait at least 30 days for the airline to respond before they can ask the CTA to help adjudicate an issue.

""I'm not usually a helpless guy. But with Flair, I felt totally helpless,"" Elmes said.

""The government was supposedly going to fix the air passengers bill of rights. That hasn't done a thing.""

A spokesperson for Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said the government announced changes to air passenger rights regulations in April — tweaks meant to make all airlines more accountable.

""Operational decisions of an airline are the airline's responsibility. That being said, we expect all air carriers, including Flair, to uphold their obligations to keep passengers safe and protect their rights. These new changes to the APPRs will help ensure this is the case,"" the spokesperson said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

bill to regulate online streaming becomes law  CBC.ca,"The Senate has passed Bill C-11, which will force streaming platforms like Netflix and YouTube to contribute to funding Canadian content. Critics say the bill is too ambiguous, leaving many issues unresolved.

A controversial government bill to overhaul Canadian broadcasting laws to regulate streaming services has passed the final hurdle in the Senate and received royal assent Thursday evening.

After years of debate, the Senate gave its final approval Thursday to Bill C-11, also known as the Online Streaming Act. It received royal assent shortly after.

The bill makes changes to Canada's Broadcasting Act. The legislation requires streaming services, such as Netflix and Spotify, to pay to support Canadian media content like music and TV shows.

It also requires the platforms to promote Canadian content. Specifically, the bill says ""online undertakings shall clearly promote and recommend Canadian programming, in both official languages as well as in Indigenous languages.""

The changes give the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), Canada's broadcast regulator, broad powers over digital media companies, including the ability to impose financial penalties for violations of the act.

The government says the legislation is necessary to impose the same regulations and requirements in place for traditional broadcasters on online media platforms. Right now, broadcasters are required to spend at least 30 per cent of their revenue on supporting Canadian content.

""Online streaming has changed how we create, discover, and consume our culture, and it's time we updated our system to reflect that,"" a government news release on the bill says.

The Conservatives have slammed the bill as an attack on freedom of expression.

""Under this archaic system of censorship, government gatekeepers will now have the power to control which videos, posts and other content Canadians can see online,"" a Conservative webpage on C-11 says.

The public debate has been contentious, with supporters saying the bill will boost the Canadian media and arts sectors, while critics warn that the bill could over-regulate the internet.

Internet companies affected by the legislation also have criticized C-11. The online video sharing platform TikTok warned the bill could affect its users, despite the government insisting the regulations won't cover user-generated content.

""Without the legislative clarity they asked for, digital-first creators are now left to simply hope that the government keeps its promise not to regulate user-generated content,"" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.

Google, YouTube's parent company, launched a public campaign against the legislation, saying it would negatively affect users' experience on the platform.

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez, C-11's sponsor, has dismissed much of the criticism of the bill from the Conservatives and tech companies, describing it as inaccurate.

The bill's journey through Parliament has been difficult. Rodriguez tabled the legislation in the House of Commons in February 2022. Nearly a year later, the Senate sent C-11 back to the House of Commons with amendments. The House accepted most of the amendments but rejected others.

One of the most contentious points of debate is whether C-11 would apply to user-generated content, such as podcasts and online videos. The government has insisted that the legislation is not intended to regulate independent content creators.

One of the Senate's amendments would have added protections for some types of user-generated content like comedy acts and instructional videos. The House rejected that amendment, arguing that it could create loopholes for streaming giants.

The House sent the bill back to the Senate, and — after days of further debate — C-11 received formal approval from the upper chamber on Thursday.

Sen. Paula Simons voted against the bill passing, but said the argument that the bill is about censorship was ""fear mongering."" (Mike McArthur/CBC)

Sen. Paula Simons, who said she sought to quiet the firestorm of disinformation surrounding the bill, endorsed an amendment that would have added further protections for individuals who post content online.

She ultimately voted against the bill but said the claim that the bill amounts to censorship is ""fearmongering.""

""We may think it's nanny-statism to a certain extent, trying to get us to eat our vegetables. You know, eat your kale, eat your yogurt, watch your Cancon. That is not the same thing as censorship,"" she said told CBC Radio's The House in an interview airing Saturday.

Sen. Andrew Cardozo, a former CRTC commissioner, said broadcasting rules needed to be updated to address the change in technology.

""You think of TikTok five years ago, TikTok only referred to the sound that a clock made,"" he told The House.

Senator Leo Housakos said the upper chamber should've stood its ground and forced the government to accept its amendments. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

Conservative senators argued that the upper chamber should stand its ground and force the government to accept its amendments.

Sen. Leo Housakos said he was ""disappointed"" when the bill passed.

""I'm disappointed … that the Senate didn't stand its ground given the fact that we've heard from so many stakeholders that are so concerned about this piece of legislation,"" he told The House.

The government put forward a similar version of the bill in 2020 but it died when Parliament was dissolved in August 2021.

Bill's effects in practice still a mystery

The bill's broad language means it's unclear what it will do in practice — an aspect of the legislation the Senate has acknowledged.

For example, the bill says Canadian broadcasting should ""serve the needs and interests of all Canadians, including Canadians from racialized communities and Canadians of diverse ethnocultural backgrounds, socio-economic statuses, abilities and disabilities, sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and ages.""

""Precisely what this would mean in concrete terms for broadcasters is not yet known,"" a Senate page on C-11 reads.

""Another complicating factor is that the bill would give the CRTC new powers — but exactly how or even if the CRTC would make use of them cannot be determined through an analysis of the bill alone.""

But the government is expected to clarify many areas of uncertainty through a policy directive to the CRTC. A Senate amendment that the House of Commons accepted requires the CRTC to hold public consultations on how it will use its new regulatory powers.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

U.S. have reached a NAFTA deal — now called the USMCA  CBC News","Canada and the U.S. have announced a tentative new trilateral trade deal with Mexico that includes some key concessions on issues of import to both countries — and also a reworked name: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

""​USMCA will give our workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a joint statement released late Sunday.

""It will strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home,"" the statement said. ""We look forward to further deepening our close economic ties when this new agreement enters into force.""

After 14 months of intensive and often fractious negotiations between the two countries, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau convened a late-night meeting of cabinet to brief ministers because a deal had been reached only hours before a U.S.-imposed midnight deadline.

'A good day for Canada'

Leaving the meeting about an hour and 15 minutes after it began, Trudeau said only that it was ""a good day for Canada"" and that he'd have more to say to reporters on Monday.

“It’s a good day for Canada” says Trudeau as he leaves his office. He’ll have more to say tomorrow. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#cdnpoli</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nafta?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nafta</a> <a href=""https://t.co/10MDX6rNDe"">pic.twitter.com/10MDX6rNDe</a> —@iamSas

In a background briefing with reporters, a senior Trump administration official heralded the USMCA as a win for all three countries.

""This is a big win for the U.S., Mexico and for Canada and it fulfils one of the president's most important campaign promises,"" a senior Trump administration official said. ""We think this is a fantastic agreement. It's a great win for the president and a validation of his strategy in the area of international trade.""

At the heart of the deal is a trade-off between greater U.S. access to Canada's dairy market, which is heavily protected by a system of supply management, and Canadian demands for the maintenance of a dispute resolution process.

The two sides have agreed to keep Chapter 19, NAFTA's dispute resolution mechanism, intact. That's a major victory for Canadian negotiators who have long sought to keep some sort of process to challenge anti-dumping and countervailing-duty cases — which Canada has deployed in the past over the softwood lumber file.

Chapter 19 preserved word for word

Chapter 19 will be preserved word for word, though it will be renumbered in the new agreement, U.S. officials said Sunday.

Lighthizer has steadfastly opposed this chapter, as he believes it's a violation of U.S. sovereignty to have a multinational panel of arbiters decide on the acceptability of U.S. tariffs.

A Trump administration official deflected Sunday when asked if preserving Chapter 19 was a win for Canada. ""From our perspective we think there's really, really great things in this agreement. We're excited about those parts of it,"" the official said.

(Chapter 11, however, will be phased out between the U.S. and Canada, Trump officials said. This chapter, which outlines the investor-state dispute settlement, allowed corporations to sue governments at special tribunals for interfering in their business.)

​In exchange for some U.S. concessions on a dispute mechanism, Canada is expected to give U.S. farmers greater access to Canada's dairy market by increasing the quota on foreign imports.

Under the current supply management system, Canada imposes tariffs on dairy imports — which can run as high as 300 per cent — that exceed the established quota. Trump has railed against these tariffs as unfair to American farmers, as they are designed to keep foreign products out while privileging Canadian sources.

Dairy concessions could be politically challenging

Some of what Canada has agreed to could be politically challenging for the Liberal government, especially in Quebec, where dairy farmers hold electoral sway in certain ridings.

Under the new NAFTA, the U.S. will have roughly the same access to the Canadian dairy market as what was given up by Trudeau when he signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade deal with 10 Asia-Pacific countries earlier this year.

Under that agreement, those 10 countries will have market access that equals 3.25 per cent of Canada's annual milk production. The exact percentage extended to U.S. dairy exporters was not immediately clear — but it will be marginally higher than that 3.25 per cent now open to Asian countries.

""We've achieved levels of market access, from the perspective of the U.S., that are a better deal than what the prior administration negotiated in TPP,"" a Trump administration official said of what former U.S. president Barack Obama squeezed out of the Canadians on the dairy front.

Trump officials say dairy changes major breakthrough

But, perhaps most importantly for dairy producers, Canada has agreed to end what's called class 7 pricing, a milk class created in March 2017 that slashed prices on some Canadian-produced milk ingredients — like protein concentrates, skim milk and whole milk powder — used to make cheese and yogurt. The co-ordinated price cut made the American equivalents uncompetitive.

Trump administration officials pounced on this change Sunday, touting it as a major breakthrough for American farmers, especially in Wisconsin and New York, where dairy farmers are eager to offload some of their product on Canada as they grapple with severe oversupply.

""On the dairy issue, we have a great result for our dairy farmers ... and this was one of the president's key objectives,"" the Trump administration official said. ""Canada has agreed to eliminate the class 7 milk pricing system, which is something that was very problematic.""

At the outset of the NAFTA talks, the U.S. demanded Canada dismantle supply management entirely — something that Trudeau has always maintained was a non-starter. Its preservation, save for a few tweaks, will be pitched as a success story by the governing Liberals.

Steel and aluminum imports still an open question

Canada is also expected to sign on to this new NAFTA without any reassurances that the U.S. will lift its so-called ""section 232"" tariffs on steel and aluminum imports — a coup for the economic nationalists that surround Trump who believe that protectionist measures like these punitive tariffs can help salvage the declining U.S. steel industry.

""There isn't any agreement on that at this point,"" a Trump administration official said. ""There's been talk about potential discussions there, but that's on a completely separate track.""

Canadian sources told CBC News they hope to resolve the 232 issue before ratifying NAFTA.

Those tariffs were levied on ""national security"" grounds using presidential authority granted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gives the president broad powers to impose tariffs without consulting Congress. Canada responded to Trump's move with counter-tariffs on billions of dollars worth of U.S. goods.

While technically separate from NAFTA talks, the U.S. has used the threat of further 232 tariffs on autos to extract concessions from Canada and Mexico — a frightening proposition for the Canadians.

No hard limit on auto exports

Importantly for Canadian negotiators, Trump has agreed that no hard limit will be placed on Canadian auto exports to the U.S.

That said, should the U.S. move forward with the imposition of worldwide 232 tariffs on autos, they would also apply to Canada.

However, Ottawa has negotiated what is effectively an exemption, as it would still be able to export cars and parts tariff-free up to a certain amount that is well above what Canada sends south of the border.

Sources could not immediately confirm the exact number of cars or parts that would be allowable, but U.S. officials said there has been an ""accommodation"" reached.

U.S.-Mexico deal came first

Last month, Trump announced his negotiators had reached a bilateral deal with Mexico.

The Canadians have already said they are pleased with what the U.S. had negotiated bilaterally with Mexico on changes to ""rules of origin"" around autos, championing the changes as good for middle-class workers on both sides of the border.

The revised USMCA deal will require 75 per cent of auto content to be made in North America, up from 62.5 per cent under the current NAFTA.

It would also require 40-45 per cent of auto content made in Mexico to be made by workers earning at least $16 US an hour, placating unions in Canada and the U.S. concerned about high-paying jobs moving to Mexico's low-wage economy.

According to the U.S. Trade Representative, Canada ships more than $56 billion US worth of autos — cars and parts alike — to the U.S. each year. The auto industry employs more than 120,000 people in Canada, with most of those jobs concentrated in southwestern Ontario.

Canada has also secured exemptions for its creative industries.

The existing NAFTA deal includes a cultural exemption clause, which means cultural goods are not treated like other commercial products — and that will continue under the new terms of the agreement. Lighthizer has previously cited Canada's broadcasting content and telecommunication ownership rules as an irritant.

Deal to be sent to Congress

U.S. negotiators have been gunning for a new NAFTA by month's end to get a text of the agreement to Congress for its mandatory 60-day review period. That could allow for a deal to be signed before Dec 1., when Mexico's new, left-leaning president takes office.

Under U.S. law, while Congress can extend fast-track negotiating authority to Trump administration officials — as it has with NAFTA — legislators retain the right to review any proposed trade agreement and decide whether it will be implemented. That relationship is governed by a set of strict, legislated timelines that allow Congress enough time to study a deal before delivering a decision.

Tonight, Canada and the United States reached an agreement, alongside Mexico, on a new and modern trade agreement, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMCA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#USMCA</a>). Read the statement: <a href=""https://t.co/vF8SFu50ao"">https://t.co/vF8SFu50ao</a> —@cafreeland

A Trump administration official said Trudeau, Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will sign the USMCA at the end of November.

It will then be up to the next Congress — which could be fundamentally reconstituted after November's midterm elections — to ratify the agreement before it comes in to force.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

disinformation being spread by Russia, China, say experts  CBC News","Russia and China are driving an online wave of disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, say experts.

Some of the disinformation circulating online amounts to conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus — claims that it was invented in a lab or brought to China by U.S. soldiers, for example.

Some of it involves false reports that experts say could end up harming people — the claim that handwashing doesn't help to prevent the spread of COVID-19, for example, or that the virus doesn't affect smokers.

Canadian Philip Howard heads the Oxford Internet Institute, a U.K.-based academic body studying the sociology of the internet. He said the pandemic has seen an increase in misinformation and disinformation related to COVID-19 being spread by sources related to foreign governments.

""We've seen quite a significant uptick in misinformation generated by foreign state actors, particularly from Russia and China,"" Howard told CBC News. ""In fact, 92 per cent of the misinformation from state-backed agencies around the world originates from Russia and China.""

Philip Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute, says his team has seen an increase in online disinformation during the pandemic. (Submitted by Philip Howard)

'Spin is not lying'

""Disinformation"" is false or fake information deliberately spread in an attempt to conceal, divide or disrupt.

Disinformation should be distinguished from attempts by politicians or nations to spin the facts to advance their political goals, said Republican Ron Nehring, director of international training for the Washington-based Leadership Institute.

""Spin is spin,"" he said. ""But spin is not lying.""

WATCH | Russia and China push novel coronavirus misinformation on social media:

Russia and China push coronavirus misinformation on social media Duration 2:02 Russia and China are spreading coronavirus misinformation on social media to further their own national agendas, using officials, bots and state-run media.

Social media platforms have been more active lately in taking down health information that is inaccurate or could be harmful, along with accounts engaging in ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"" by working together to spread misinformation.

Last week, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh reported that roughly 45 per cent of tweets related to lifting pandemic restrictions were being posted by ""bots"" — autonomous programs presented as authentic online users — and mirrored messaging from Russia and China.

A 'war of ideology'

""They were rebroadcasting messages from state-sponsored media, especially Russia and China,"" said Kathleen Carley, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon. ""So whenever they sent out a message, it was then rebroadcast by ... a little army of bots.""

Some bots have been tweeting links to websites that contain disinformation.

Stephanie Carvin, a former security analyst for the Canadian government who now teaches at Carleton University, said the pandemic is moving ""from a war for survival to a war of ideas and a war of ideology.""

The absence of a convincing origin story for the virus makes it easy for disinformation to spread, she said.

""Because there is no clear story here, and because China will almost make it impossible for us to probably ever find out how this really happened, this is going to lend itself to disinformation for decades,"" she said.

Carvin said some of the disinformation she's seen online is focused on the virus's origins.

""There's no question in my mind ... I think that both Russia and China are definitely trying to spread the idea that this was some kind of U.S. bioweapon,"" she said. ""It's cheap and easy for them to do. It is an issue that most people have been affected by and are interested in.""

'Fertile ground' for spreading lies

Peter Stano is a spokesperson for the European Union External Action Service, which includes a unit set up to monitor and counter disinformation. He said his group is seeing a lot of pandemic-related misinformation and disinformation, and some of it is coming from sources linked to the Kremlin.

""This is a novel situation,"" he said. ""This is a new crisis where there are still much more questions than there are answers. There are unprecedented measures being introduced by governments. There is no vaccine. There is still a lack of information and clarity about how it actually came into being.

""So this is fertile ground for anyone who wants to spread misinformation, disinformation and all kinds of conspiracies.""

Howard said there are some similarities between the messages being spread and the techniques being employed by actors linked to Russia or China — but he's also seeing differences.

Both China and Russia are promoting the narrative that democracies are failing and lack the capacity or will to fight the pandemic, while claiming that they are doing a better job at searching for a cure and helping other countries with their pandemic measures.

Howard said Russia has years-old social media accounts that tend to post about things like soap operas or soccer scores — until they're needed to push out political messages.

China's social media misinformation and disinformation efforts are more recent, he said, and are more focused on refuting suggestions that China is to blame for the pandemic.

""They've really just started doing this work over the last year since the Hong Kong protests,"" he said. ""They'll simply buy one hundred thousand fake accounts, set them all up at once and get them retweeting or get them to push out content.""

Disinformation efforts linked to Russia and China also are demonstrating that they have a long reach on social media, said Howard.

""The thing that's really surprised us is the volume of content that those governments produce in English,"" he said. ""So at the moment, they can reach almost a billion social media user accounts a week with English language content that is across Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and Reddit.""

Often, Howard said, the attempts at disinformation take the form of suggestions that the virus escaped from a lab or was an experiment gone wrong in the West.

""We just finished a study of six countries, public opinion in six countries, and found that almost a quarter of the respondents in the U.K. and Argentina and the U.S. ... think that the virus originated in a lab."" he said.

An attempt to rewrite the narrative

Nehring said he's also seeing key differences between Beijing and Moscow when it comes to disinformation strategy. China is trying to rewrite the narrative, he said, by suggesting that U.S. army officers brought the virus to Wuhan during military games in December — but Kremlin-controlled media outlets appear to be trying to prolong the pandemic outside of Russia.

""We saw articles ... claiming that handwashing has no impact on stemming the spread of the virus, that smokers do not get coronavirus, that ginger can be used to prevent contracting the disease,"" said Nehring. ""Tons of false information that's never been corrected, never been retracted and is still online today, being put out by the Russians.""

The Russian government says it is western countries that are spreading disinformation.

""By spreading falsehoods, gossip and fakes, some biased experts are doing self-promotion through blaming Russia for all (the) world's calamities, including COVID-19,"" the Russian Embassy's press office said in a statement.

""On the contrary, disinformation is the major tool of Western MSM (mainstream media) which is the case when they cover (the) coronavirus situation in Russia. Digging dirt on Russia, ignoring reality (lowest mortality rate and record testing) does not improve (the) pandemic situation in Canada.""

The Chinese embassy has yet to respond to questions from CBC News.

of man who fought in Nazi unit unaware Hunka would be honoured in Parliament, friend says  CBC News","The family of Yaroslav Hunka is in hiding in the wake of a political firestorm tied to his service with a Nazi unit in the Second World War, according to a family friend. That same friend says the family didn't know Parliament would honour Hunka the way it did.

A longtime friend says the Hunka family was unaware 98-year-old Yaroslav Hunka would be honoured in Parliament last week in front of Ukraine's president, setting off an international controversy.

Barb Bonenfant, who lives in North Bay, Ont., told CBC News that Hunka's daughter-in-law sent her a message on Sunday after the public backlash began.

""She said that her family was shocked at what happened,"" said Bonenfant. ""If her and her husband would have had any idea what was going to happen, they would have never brought this 98-year-old man to Ottawa.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered ""unreserved apologies"" on Canada's behalf on Wednesday for parliamentarians giving a standing ovation without knowing the Ukrainian Second World War veteran fought for Nazi Germany. Trudeau called it an ""egregious error"" that ""deeply embarrassed Parliament and Canada.""

Trudeau also said Canada reached out to Kyiv through diplomatic channels to apologize to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hunka's local MP Anthony Rota first apologized on Sunday and again in the House of Commons on Tuesday when he tendered his resignation as Speaker. Rota said he was unaware of Hunka's past after it came to light he served with the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS.

The Speaker's office has said Hunka's ""son contacted Rota's constituency office and asked if it would be possible for Mr. Hunka to attend the address in the House of Commons by Mr. Zelenskyy."" The Speaker's office said it accepted this request.

Rota's constituency's office policy is to forward all invitations to the speaker's office. The Speaker's office won't say who wrote Rota's speech.

In light of the uproar, B'nai Brith Canada and the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies are reiterating longstanding calls for the federal government to declassify secret documents about Nazi war criminals in Canada.

This week, Immigration Minister Marc Miller said Canada ""has a really dark history with Nazis in Canada"" and could revisit demands to release documents.

Reaction in North Bay

CBC News traveled to North Bay, Ont., this week where shock waves from the political controversy are being felt in Rota and Hunka's home town.

""The family is in hiding here in North Bay,"" Bonenfant said. ""I'm sure [they're] afraid to show their faces.""

North Bay, Ont., resident Barb Bonenfant said Yaroslav Hunka's daughter-in-law sent her a message on Sunday saying their family was in 'shock.' ""They just thought he would be in the same room as the [Ukrainian] president,' said Bonenfant. 'They didn't know that he would be brought to attention. (Olivier Hyland/CBC)

Larry Fuld is a North Bay resident who is part of the city's small Jewish community. He lost family members in the Holocaust. Fuld said the words ""Nazi"" and ""SS"" conjure up horrible imagery — and deservedly so.

Fuld said Rota called him on Sunday to personally apologize.

""He explained that he made a mistake and that Mr. Hunka was introduced to parliament and his background was unknown,"" said Fuld. ""And he regrets the situation, he regrets any pain or discomfort that he's caused to the Jewish community.""

Fuld said he accepted the apology. He said he told Rota he knows there was no intended malice.

Fuld said he met Rota about 20 years ago at a synagogue fundraiser, adding that he's a ""staunch supporter of Israel.""

""I think it's just very unfortunate that this lapse of investigation and protocol has got us to where we are today,"" he said.

Fuld said he doesn't personally know the Hunka family, but does know that Yaroslav Hunka's son, Martin Hunka, is a ""well respected member of our community"" who has been very philanthropic.

North Bay resident Larry Fuld said he accepted his MP Anthony Rota's apology. Fuld lost family in the Holocaust and said how this whole situation has unfolded is 'very unfortunate on so many levels.' (Olivier Hyland/CBC)

Before retiring, Martin Hunka was the CFO at Redpath Mining, a major employer in North Bay. He was also the chair of the North Bay Hospital Foundation, but is no longer named on the hospital's website.

The Hunka family received a request for an interview from CBC News on Thursday and has not yet responded.

Bonenfant said she's known the Hunka family for more than 30 years and they have a reputation in North Bay for ""their integrity."" She described them as a ""honest, kind, helping family.""

All she knew about Yaroslav Hunka, Bonenfant said, is that he's a ""proud Ukrainian"" who supported Zelenskky's fight against Russia.

The Hunka family did not know in advance that Rota would honour him during his speech or call him a ""hero,"" said Bonenfant. ""They just thought he would be in the same room as the president.""

Fuld said he supports Jewish groups' calls for an investigation into Hunka's past for ""everybody's sake.""

""Either he should be exonerated and we should know he came here properly and there's nothing in the background; or we should find out that there is and the proper authorities will deal with it,"" said Fuld.

Residents say Trudeau should share some blame

In North Bay, many members of the community told CBC News they felt Rota made a significant mistake and was right to step down, but felt he shouldn't have shouldered the blame alone.

Residents Hana and Ivan Srut said the Prime Minister should have taken more responsibility.

""If your soldiers make a mistake, the general is responsible,"" said Ivan Srut of Trudeau. ""The general should bear the responsibility for his soldiers. And this is the case that he should be the one that maybe steps away as well.""

The couple fled Czechoslovakia in 1968, they said, because of the Russians and started a new life in Canada. They ran a local restaurant for decades that's now closed. Hunka and Rota separately dined there and the Sruts said they were regulars and good customers.

They said they didn't know about Hunka's military experience.

The Sruts question why parliament's protocol office doesn't go beyond a criminal record check when allowing guests in parliament during a world leader's visit. They also question why Hunka was allowed to live in Canada in the first place. They said it's the ""entire system's"" fault.

North Bay residents Hana and Ivan Srut said they know Yaroslav Hunka because he dined at their former restaurant, but didn't know about his military past. 'He was coming as a customer he was not telling us any of his life stories,' said Ivan Srut. (Olivier Hyland/CBC)

'Why are potential war criminals living here?'

Political science professor David Tabachnick at Nipissing University said North Bay isn't a natural Liberal riding, but people voted for Rota because of his deep roots as an MP, former city councillor, businessman and his work at his university.

Those who know Rota personally ""think it's a terrible shame"" what unfolded, but understand and ""accept the nature of the resignation,"" said Tabachnick.

WATCH / PM apologizes for Parliament's tribute to man who fought in Nazi unit: PM apologizes for Parliament's tribute to man with Nazi ties Duration 3:53 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for Parliament's tribute to a man who fought for the Nazis in the Second World War. But for some the words don't go far enough, and for others, it needs to be followed by action.

""Why are war criminals or potential war criminals living here in Canada as members of our immigrant community?"" said Tabachnick. ""This is the larger story and I think quite eye opening to many members that really don't know about this history.""

The Hunka family is a ""fairly well known"" in the community, Tabachnick said, and some have played prominent roles in business, charity and fundraising.

""Many members of the community are very surprised this person is associated with this past,"" he said. ""What actually he did, we do not know.""

""Not only is Anthony Rota's reputation damaged, this family's reputation is damaged. We might not feel very sympathetic for a former member of the SS unit, but he has children, and grandchildren, friends and family here in the community that many of them probably did not know his past.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

ministers being dropped from cabinet in upcoming shuffle, sources say  CBC News","Multiple ministers are being dropped from federal cabinet in a shuffle expected to take place Wednesday, sources tell CBC News.

Those senior government sources say the shuffle is intended to put the focus on the government's economic priorities —including housing — and shore up the cabinet ahead of the next federal election campaign. The government also wants to put key communicators on important files.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called ministers back to Ottawa for meetings on Monday and Tuesday, said sources with knowledge of the shuffle who are not authorized to speak publicly.

Such meetings typically happen just before a cabinet shuffle to allow the prime minister to present ministers with their new portfolios. The prime minister's public itinerary shows he will be in private meetings on Tuesday. His Monday itinerary also said he was in private meetings.

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland will keep her position, said sources with knowledge of the meetings.

According to Radio-Canada, CBC's French-language arm, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly and Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault are not changing portfolios.

Speaking to reporters Monday, Mental Health and Addictions Minister Carolyn Bennett announced she will not be seeking re-election in the Toronto—St. Paul's riding. While she is staying on as an MP, it would not be surprising if Trudeau replaced the veteran politician in cabinet with someone re-offering for the next election.

Like Bennett, Transportation Minister Omar Alghabra will not be seeking re-election and will be shuffled out of cabinet as a result, sources tell CBC. He is expected to make an announcement about his future on Tuesday.

Sources said Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Ginette Petitpas Taylor, the minister responsible for official languages and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, are among those who have been asked to return to Ottawa.

Several ministerial announcements that had been scheduled for early this week have been cancelled. They include events originally set for Monday with Petitpas Taylor in Montreal, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra in Vancouver and Housing Minister Ahmed Hussen in St. John's.

It's not clear if those ministers will be changing jobs. Cancelled ministerial events are often a sign that a cabinet shuffle is pending.

Last month, several Liberal sources told Radio-Canada they believe Marco Mendicino is at risk of being removed as minister of public safety.

Mendicino has been under intense pressure due to the controversy over the transfer of serial killer Paul Bernardo to a medium-security prison. The minister also has come under fire over his management of the government's gun control legislation and the foreign interference file.

WATCH | Trudeau to shuffle cabinet with eye on next election: Significant changes to federal cabinet expected Wednesday Duration 2:03 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to shuffle his cabinet on Wednesday and sources tell CBC News that multiple ministers could be out.

Asked last week in Kingston, Ont., whether he had confidence in Mendicino, Trudeau did not answer directly.

""I have an amazing team in Ottawa and an amazing group of MPs right across the country who are committed to serving their country every single day, and anyone in my cabinet by definition has my confidence,"" he said.

Shuffle expected to be Trudeau's largest since 2021

The shuffle is expected to be the biggest change to Trudeau's cabinet since October 2021, when the Liberals' second minority mandate was a month old.

It comes ahead of a scheduled cabinet retreat next month in P.E.I., which should give new ministers a few weeks to familiarize themselves with their portfolios.

This shuffle will put the prime minister's team in place for the next federal election.

Trudeau undertook a similar retooling of his cabinet in July 2018, prior to the 2019 federal election campaign. That shuffle saw five ministers added to cabinet and new portfolios created for seniors, intergovernmental affairs and border security.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

Brown steps down from Supreme Court, halting probe into misconduct claim  CBC News","Russell Brown announced Monday he's stepping down as a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada effective immediately — a move that comes after the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) began probing a claim of misconduct directed against Brown related to an incident in the U.S.

Brown's decision to step down from Canada's top court means the CJC's investigation of an alleged alcohol-fuelled incident in Arizona will come to an end without any sort of public report on the matter.

Under the federal Judges Act, the council has a duty to investigate complaints made against federally appointed judges. Now that Brown has resigned, the council said, that work will stop.

Brown has been on leave for months since reports surfaced that the judge got into some sort of confrontation with patrons at a high-end Scottsdale-area resort at the end of January.

While accounts of the incident differ, it has been established that there was some sort of fight between Brown and a man at the resort, Jon Crump, a U.S. Marine veteran who was at the resort with a group of friends.

Crump alleges a drunken Brown was belligerent and harassed his drinking companions. He said Brown followed him and some in his group back to their hotel rooms. After a brief skirmish, Crump said he punched Brown after he wouldn't leave. Then, Crump reported the Stephen Harper-appointed judge to the CJC.

Brown has said Crump's version of events is false and instead claims the former Marine inexplicably punched him in the head.

Conflicting versions of events

In a statement, Brown said the CJC probe into the Arizona incident ""may continue well into 2024,"" a delay he said is in ""nobody's interests — the Court's, the public's, my family's or my own.""

""I have therefore decided that the common good is best served by my retirement, so that a replacement judge can join the court in time for its busy fall term,"" Brown said.

Brown said he had hoped the CJC review would be ""dispensed with quickly and would not significantly impact the court's business.""

""Sadly, that has not been the case,"" the former top judge said.

Brown's lawyers, Brian Gover and Alexandra Heine, also released a statement calling his resignation a ""regrettable result"" prompted by a ""spurious complaint.""

Brown's lawyers said Crump ""weaponized Canada's judicial discipline process"" to punish the judge.

According to a Paradise Valley Police Department report on the matter obtained by CBC News, Crump called law enforcement to report the altercation in the early morning hours of January 29.

He told Adam Balcom, the officer dispatched to the Omni Scottsdale Resort & Spa, that Brown was ""hitting on"" and ""touching"" some of Crump's female companions.

As they started to walk back to their hotel rooms, Crump said Brown followed them.

""To protect the women and to prevent the drunk, creepy, unwanted male from entering the hotel room uninvited, Crump punched the male a few times,"" Balcom said in his report, citing Crump's version of events.

""These few punches proved successful in stopping the unwanted drunk male, and he walked away.""

'You called police to say you beat up a guy?

Balcom said Crump was ""argumentative, hostile, antagonistic"" while reporting the incident — behaviour the officer attributed to Crump's intoxication.

Police-worn body camera footage of the January night shows a rattled-looking Crump hurling profanities at the officers who came to the resort.

Crump, wearing a shirt allegedly torn by Brown during their scuffle, became verbally combative after a puzzled police officer initially questioned why Crump called law enforcement when he admitted to punching Brown.

""You called police to say you beat up a guy?"" Balcom said.

""There's nothing here then? This guy being a creeper and then following these girls to their room is totally fine?"" Crump said in response.

""One hundred per cent he was touching them. He kissed them on the f--king hand. He was trying to follow them to their f--king room. He's groping them on the f--king chair.""

""Your hostile attitude and aggressive demeanour has no part in this conversation. It's not going to be productive at all,"" Balcom said.

""Shut up dude. Just shut your mouth,"" Crump said to the officer before Balcom threatened to arrest him for disorderly conduct.

The nearly hour-long footage depicts Balcom's interactions with Crump and then his interviews with three of Crump's female companions, all of whom allegedly were involved in the incident.

The four people interviewed by the Paradise Valley police officer relayed similar versions of the night's events.

'Very uncomfortable'

One of the women reported that she invited Brown to join her and her mother for drinks near them at the resort bar.

After identifying himself as a Supreme Court justice, Brown allegedly proceeded to kiss the woman in question ""once or twice"" on her cheek, and then touched the small of her back and a leg.

The woman told the officer that Brown did not touch her buttocks, breasts or vaginal area. She said Brown made her feel ""very uncomfortable.""

She told the officer that she was ""thankful"" that Crump escorted her back to her room after Brown's alleged unwanted advances.

The woman's mother, who appeared to Balcom to be sober, told the officer that Brown was ""very intoxicated"" and ""creepy.""

She said Crump's use of force was ""reasonable and necessary to get the creepy drunk man away from them.""

Balcom said he was unable to get Brown's version of events.

'No crime was determined'

He said he knocked on Brown's hotel room door multiple times but got no response. The resort staff only knew Brown's name and cell phone number.

Without hearing Brown's side of the story, Balcom concluded that two intoxicated men got into a brief physical altercation after Brown followed the group back to their hotel room and attempted to follow the women inside their room uninvited.

""Based on the totality of the circumstances, the use of force appeared reasonable and necessary, and no crime was determined,"" Balcom said.

After Crump went public with his version of events in an interview with the Vancouver Sun, Brown issued a statement in March challenging some of the former Marine's story.

Justice Russell Brown claimed he was punched in the head without 'warning or provocation' during the incident in Arizona. (CBC)

""On the evening of January 28, 2023, I was in Arizona to participate in an awards banquet at a local resort. Following the event, I joined other attendees at the resort lounge. In the course of the evening, a group at a nearby table invited me to join them,"" Brown said in that statement.

Brown said that while he was chatting with the group, a man identified as Crump joined the group but did not speak to Brown.

""We all left the lounge at roughly the same time. Outside the lounge, Mr. Crump objected to me rejoining the group and suddenly, without warning or provocation, punched me several times in the head. Taken by surprise, I was unable to defend myself,"" Brown said.

Gover and Heine said Monday that they've uncovered other ""evidence"" they claim refutes Crump's story.

They said the new evidence suggests there were ""glaring contradictions, inaccuracies and embellishments"" in Crump's story to police, the lawyers said.

They said the evidence includes surveillance footage depicting Brown's interactions with Crump's female companions, evidence from the hotel bartender, evidence from a hotel security officer who attended to the incident, a recording of Crump's 911 call and ""investigative reports prepared by a very experienced and capable investigator, who is a former police detective.""

The lawyers did not explain how this new material would refute claims by Crump and his female companions about that January night in Arizona.

""This evidence and the other evidence uncovered increasingly pointed in one direction: to a calculated plan by the complainant to concoct an account in which Justice Brown was the aggressor — to 'get out ahead of it,' in the words of one of the complainant's own companions,"" Brown's lawyers said.

""We are confident that, in light of all this evidence, Justice Brown would have been completely vindicated at the conclusion of the Canadian Judicial Council's process. However, the effect of the process on the court and the considerable strain on Justice Brown and his family, have led him to this decision to retire.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

President Zelenskyy to visit Canada this week: sources  CBC.ca,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Canada later this week after his visit to the United Nations and the U.S., sources told CBC News.

Zelenskyy will visit Ottawa and Toronto during his Canadian trip, sources said.

The Ukrainian president is expected to address the UN General Assembly on Tuesday to rally support for continued help to repel Russia's invasion.

U.S. President Joe Biden will be hosting Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Thursday.

Zelenskyy is expected to address Parliament in Ottawa on Friday, then head to Toronto, sources said.

The Ukrainian president's trip to Canada, which was first reported by The Globe and Mail, has not officially been announced. It would be his first since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.

WATCH | What's behind the surge in Ukraine drone attacks in Russia: What’s behind the surge in Ukraine drone attacks in Russia Duration 6:33 Ukraine has been ramping up drone attacks against its Russian invader, but behind the fireworks, what’s the real impact? CBC’s Briar Stewart breaks down Ukraine’s brash offensive and how it's forcing Russia to react.

Canadian and Ukrainian government officials in Ottawa and Kyiv declined to comment on Tuesday but quiet security preparations have been underway on Parliament Hill for days.

Zelenskyy delivered a virtual address to Parliament in the early phases of the full Russian invasion.

Trudeau has visited Kyiv twice since the onset of major hostilities and the two leaders last met face-to-face at the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania in July. At that meeting, G7 countries proposed a framework initiative to provide Ukraine with long-term security assurances while the Eastern European nation waits to join the western military alliance.

Canada's individual security guarantee was expected to be a matter for negotiation over the summer.

Zelenskyy is expected to ask for additional military support while in Ottawa.

Dominique Arel, chair of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Ottawa, said the visit comes at a critical time — when the war with Russia is not top of mind in many western nations, including Canada, and the counteroffensive is making only modest progress.

He said that this speech — Zelenskyy's second to Parliament — is perhaps more significant than the one he gave at the onset of heavy fighting because the public is generally aware of developments in the war and is following them more closely.

""Nothing replaces an address in person,"" Arel said. ""It is important to reaffirm basic principles, why is it so fundamental for Canadians as well, not just Americans or Europeans.""

Arel said that while in the United States, Republican lawmakers are questioning Washington's support for Ukraine, he has seen no evidence of wavering political support in Canada.

In his forceful address to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Zelenskyy called on nations to unite to fight ""the aggressor"" and accused Russia of carrying out a campaign of genocide against his nation.

""While Russia is pushing the world to the final war. Ukraine is doing everything to ensure that after Russian aggression [is defeated], no one in the world will dare to attack any nation,"" Zelenskyy said.

""We have an aggressor that must be restrained, war crimes must be punished, deported people must come back home and the occupier must return to their own land. We must be united to make it.""

Prior to the Ukrainian president's address, U.S. President Joe Biden told world leaders at the annual UN General Assembly in New York that they must stand together against Russia.

""We have to stand up to this naked aggression today and deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow,"" Biden told the delegates.

On Tuesday in Ottawa, the House of Commons defence committee reversed a plan to hold a closed-door briefing on the state of the war in Ukraine. The four-party committee had been set to hear testimony from senior military and Global Affairs officials in private but the meeting was opened up.

Maj.-Gen. Paul Prevost — director of the strategic joint staff, the military's nerve centre — told the committee that western allies are expecting Russia to conduct another round of mobilization with the aim of launching a renewed offensive in Ukraine.

""On this remobilization, we don't have any numbers, and I don't think Russia will publish any numbers because their first mobilization didn't work very well,"" Prevost said, noting how Russia's last attempt at an offensive did not result in many gains.

Using western military equipment, Ukraine's counteroffensive has made some ""tactical gains"" in the south and the east but ""there's been no breakthrough,"" he said.

Prevost told MPs that Moscow likely will increase the number of drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's electrical grid as winter approaches, as it did last year.

to cut 10 per cent of workforce, end some programming as it faces $125M budget shortfall  CBC News","The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Radio-Canada announced Monday that it plans to cut about 10 per cent of its workforce and axe some programming to cope with a potential $125 million budget shortfall.

In a news release, the public broadcaster said it plans on cutting 600 union and non-union positions across the entire organization. The corporation said about 200 vacant positions will be eliminated on top of that.

CBC and Radio-Canada, the French-language arm, will each be cutting in the range of 250 jobs, while the rest of the cuts will come from the technology and infrastructure department and other corporate divisions, said spokesperson Leon Mar.

He said some of the cuts will begin immediately but most will take effect over the coming year.

CBC/Radio-Canada — which received around $1.3 billion in public funding in the 2022-2023 fiscal year — also announced Monday it will reduce its English and French programming budgets for the next fiscal year and cut about $40 million from independent production commissions and program acquisitions. CBC programming will take a $25 million hit and Radio-Canada will see a $15 million reduction.

The corporation said earlier this year it had begun cutting $25 million through measures such as limiting travel, sponsorships and marketing, and delaying technology initiatives.

The public broadcaster blamed its budget issues on ""rising production costs, declining television advertising revenue and fierce competition from the digital giants.""

CBC/Radio-Canada said it's also grappling with ""forecast reductions"" to its parliamentary funding beginning in the next fiscal year. A fund to help the public broadcaster offset revenue losses during the pandemic is also ending, it said. The fund supplied the CBC with $21 million a year for two years.

WATCH | CBC president addresses staffing cuts, impact on Canadians: CBC president addresses staffing cuts, impact on Canadians Duration 10:09 Catherine Tait, the president and CEO of CBC/Radio-Canada, talks to Adrienne Arsenault about the corporation announcing it will cut roughly 10 per cent of the workforce and what difference Canadians will notice.

In an interview, CBC/Radio-Canada president Catherine Tait said she hopes Canadians ""won't notice too much.""

""Journalism is core and wherever possible we are trying to protect those positions,"" she told The National host Adrienne Arsenault.

""So my hope is that certainly in local news and in the regions, there won't be that dramatic an impact for our audiences.""

Tait said the audience may notice some changes to prime time television.

""Fewer programs on Gem, for example, perhaps not all the renewals of your favourite series, and perhaps fewer episodes of some of your favourite series,"" she said.

Tait says CBC/Radio-Canada facing a 'perfect storm'

When asked how the corporation ended up with such a large shortfall, Tait said the public broadcaster has obligations that differ from those of its private sector competitors.

""We serve minority language communities in the areas outside of Quebec for francophones. We're in the in the North. These are markets that will never be commercially viable, but it's important work and it's absolutely core to our mission,"" she said.

""But we also have the same pressures with respect to inflation, cost of production, cost of operations, declines in revenue related to our traditional television services. All of that has created a perfect storm.""

When asked if the corporation would drop bonuses given the job cuts, Tait said ""it's too early to say.""

""We'll be looking at that like we do all our line items in the coming months,"" she said.

The proposed cuts come as collective bargaining continues between CBC and the Canadian Media Guild.

Naomi Robinson, the union's CBC branch president, said the broadcaster has been challenged by decades of successive cuts.

""These job losses will impose additional burdens on employees who are already grappling with making ends meet on wages that have not kept pace with the rising cost of living,"" she said in a media statement.

""While our members remain committed to their work with Canada's public broadcaster, the reduction in journalists and technicians means that fewer stories will be told, and the richness of Canada's narrative will diminish.""

Robinson said it's ""imperative for the public broadcaster to have secure funding immune to political interference.""

Time to re-think CBC's mandate: journalism prof

Chris Waddell, professor emeritus at Carleton University's school of journalism, said the cuts come as no surprise at a time when news organizations around the world are struggling.

The author of the book The End of the CBC? said it's time for the federal government to take a serious look at the role of the public broadcaster.

""I would argue that they should get out of everything except news and current affairs. Get out of entertainment programming, get out of children's programming, get out of sports programming as well. There are other people who do that,"" he said.

""They're trying to do everything for everybody. And in a time of declining advertising revenue and competition, you can't afford to do that anymore. You have to pick areas that you think you can be good at and better than anyone else and focus on them.""

Waddell said he'd like to see CBC stop taking private advertising dollars and allow other organizations to take its content.

""What we need to see, I think, is a very different CBC that has no advertising, that focuses on narrower things, whose content is available to anyone free that wants to use it. Because that would be a big help to small news organizations and local news organizations that have lost their own reporters,"" he said.

""And also because most Canadian news organizations have pulled out of international news coverage. CBC still is in international news coverage and should be doing more in international news coverage, I would argue. And make that available to any broadcasters or any websites in Canada as well.""

WATCH: Heritage minister discusses CBC's future Federal minister on CBC/Radio-Canada’s future Duration 1:55 Amid reports of pending job cuts, Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge says CBC/Radio-Canada plays a unique role in informing Canadians domestically and internationally.

The layoffs at CBC/Radio-Canada are just the latest disruption in Canadian journalism in recent months.

Earlier this fall Nordstar, the company that owns the Toronto Star and other newspapers, announced that it would be seeking bankruptcy protection for the unit that owns more than 70 local newspapers and cutting about 60 per cent of its total workforce — about 600 jobs.

In June, Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) Inc. announced it would be axing 1,300 positions and closing or selling nine radio stations.

At the time, Bell — the parent company of CTV National News, BNN and CP24 — said the job cuts were a response to unfavourable public policy and regulatory conditions that it could no longer wait out.

Liberals plan to update CBC/Radio-Canada's mandate

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tasked Heritage Minister Pascal St-Onge with updating CBC/Radio-Canada's mandate. Speaking to reporters Monday, St-Onge said she hopes to start that process ""as soon as possible.""

""Even though there is a very difficult media crisis impacting all our broadcasters right now, we still need to revise CBC/Radio-Canada's mission and mandate and make sure that it fits the current situation, but still making sure that we have a strong public broadcaster,"" she said.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has frequently pitched defunding CBC.

At a recent policy convention, the party's Quebec caucus defended keeping Radio-Canada.

""It's a sad day,"" said Conservative MP Kevin Waugh, who represents Saskatoon—Grasswood.

""On the weekend I talked to several media people back home and it's bleak more than ever. This is just a continuation. I don't know the way out.""

NDP critic Peter Julian called news of the cuts ""devastating.""

""For many people, especially those in northern, remote and Indigenous communities, CBC/Radio-Canada is one of the few sources of reliable and bilingual news across Canada,"" he said in a media statement.

""New Democrats want to see the Liberals take real steps to protect news in communities that rely heavily on CBC/Radio-Canada to stay connected with the rest of the country.""

The Canadian Media Producers Association said it was too early to comment on the proposed cuts to programming.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

are being released, committee hears  CBC News","More than 200 bank accounts worth nearly $8 million were frozen when the federal government used emergency powers to end a massive protest occupation of downtown Ottawa.

Federal officials report most of the accounts are now in the process of being released, a parliamentary committee heard Tuesday.

Isabelle Jacques, assistant deputy minister of finance, told a committee of MPs that up to 210 bank accounts holding about $7.8 million were frozen under the financial measures contained in the Emergencies Act.

""Information was shared by the RCMP with financial institutions and we were informed yesterday by financial institutions that they were unfreezing the accounts,"" she said.

""The vast majority of accounts are in the process of being unfrozen, subject to any new information that the RCMP may have.""

Jacques said that because accounts are being released now, the number of accounts affected and their total dollar value continues to decrease by the day.

She also said the fact that more than 200 bank accounts were frozen did not necessarily mean that more than 200 people lost access to their funds. Jacques said that individuals may have held more than one account affected by the measures.

Some Conservative MPs have said constituents have reported that their bank accounts were frozen after they made donations to the convoy protest through one of its crowdfunding campaigns.

In a statement released Monday, the RCMP said it only provided banks with the names of convoy organizers and the owners of trucks who had refused to leave the protest area. The RCMP said it did not release an exhaustive list of every donation made.

""At no time did we provide a list of donors to financial institutions,"" the statement said.

Small donors unlikely to be affected: official

Jacques said that the financial measures in the Emergencies Act came into force on Feb. 15 and were specifically designed to apply enough financial pressure to convince protest organizers and participants to go home.

""Based on the knowledge that I have, I think it would be unlikely that someone who gave … $20 three weeks ago, or even $20 post Feb. 15, that they would have been captured by a freeze,"" she said.

""It's not impossible in view of the order, but in view of the exchange of information and the focused approach that was taken to stop the illegal funding of these activities, it would appear to be unlikely that this occurred, but not impossible.""

She said the measures should not affect anyone who provided financial support to the convoy before Feb. 15. Jacques said that anyone who saw their account frozen and who subsequently left the blockade area should expect to see the account unfrozen in the coming days.

Since the Emergencies Act was invoked, the Liberal government has been asked to explain what specific powers the act provides that did not already exist under conventional Canadian law.

Jacques told MPs that before the Emergencies Act was invoked, FINTRAC — Canada's financial intelligence unit — could not police the movement of money through some crowdfunding websites and some payment service providers.

She also said that while the federal government does have the power to freeze bank accounts in certain limited circumstances without using the Emergencies Act — in cases of suspected terrorism or financial crimes, for example — it did not do so in this instance.

""There's no other venues to freeze the accounts in view of the … illegal blockades that were ongoing,"" she said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

cabinet approves Trans Mountain expansion project  CBC News,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet have again approved the Trans Mountain expansion project, a crucial next step for the much-delayed pipeline project designed to carry nearly a million barrels of oil from Alberta's oilpatch to the B.C. coast each day.

The cabinet has affirmed the National Energy Board's conclusion that, while the pipeline has the potential to damage the environment and marine life, it's in the national interest and could contribute tens of billions of dollars to government coffers and create and sustain thousands of jobs.

Beyond approving the project, Trudeau also committed to directing every single dollar the federal government earns from the pipeline — which, when it's built, is estimated to be some $500 million a year in federal corporate tax revenue alone — to investments in unspecified clean energy projects.

Sale proceeds to go to green projects

Any proceeds from the eventual sale of the pipeline will also be earmarked for projects that would help with the transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner sources of energy.

""We need to create wealth today so we can invest in the future. We need resources to invest in Canadians so they can take advantage of the opportunities generated by a rapidly changing economy, here at home and around the world,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said building the project, which will help deliver Canadian oil to tidewater for shipment to lucrative markets in Asia, will ensure Canada is not dependent on selling its natural resources to one customer — the United States.

'We need to create wealth today so we can invest in the future' Duration 44:59 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces his government will approve the Trans Mountain pipeline and then takes questions from the media.

""As we've seen over the past few years, anything can happen with our neighbours to the south,"" Trudeau said. ""Right now, we're prisoners to the American market.""

The federal Liberal government said Tuesday it will soon begin the process of meeting with Indigenous groups who are interested in buying the project and it is open to selling as much as 100 per cent of its stake to First Nations, Métis and Inuit investors. Ottawa has said it does not want to own the project long-term.

Work could start this year

A senior government official, speaking on background to reporters ahead of the official announcement, said while there are still a number of permits and regulatory hurdles facing the controversial project, the government expects construction work to start sometime this year.

""There's six months left in 2019 and I think it's fair to say shovels will be in the ground in 2019,"" the official said. ""Plans are being drafted up, regulators are ready to move forward.""

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Tuesday he welcomed cabinet's second approval of the project and urged an aggressive construction timeline.

""We need to get a fair price for our country's energy to create good jobs and pay for public services. Approval is not construction. So now let's get it built!"" Kenney tweeted.

Citing research from the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association said that every year of construction delay reduces the value of the project by some $693 million.

""This decision has been a long time coming,"" said Chris Bloomer, president and CEO of the pipeline advocacy group. ""Further delay will only add to the opportunities Canada is losing out on every day due to the lack of market access for responsibly-produced Canadian products.""

Despite expending considerable financial and political capital on the project, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said he doesn't trust Trudeau to see this energy infrastructure project through to completion, given it was this Liberal government that cancelled the now-defunct Northern Gateway project through northern B.C.

""I doubt his sincerity because he hasn't actually done anything. Show me the pipeline. I don't believe he actually wants it built. He doesn't support our energy sector ... he failed to tell Canadians on what day construction would actually start,"" Scheer said.

'I doubt his sincerity because he hasn't actually done anything' Duration 19:45 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer responds to the government's approval of Trans Mountain by saying he doesn't believe Prime Minister Justin Trudeau really wants the pipeline built.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh added his voice to the chorus of opposition, saying it's irresponsible for the government to build a crude oil pipeline while also vowing to meet Canada's Paris emissions reduction targets, which demand Canada lower emissions by some 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030.

The Liberal government maintains the 100 megatonnes cap on emissions from Alberta's oilsands will limit future development and help Canada keep its Paris promise.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said the plan to invest profits from Trans Mountain into clean technology is a ""cynical bait-and-switch that would fool no one.""

""If you're serious about fighting climate change, you invest public funds in renewable energy. You don't invest them in a bitumen pipeline,"" she said. ""And there's no guarantee that this pipeline will ever turn a profit anyway.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Leader Elizabeth May respond to TMX decision Duration 8:15 Singh and May both express their disappointment with the Liberal government for his decision to approve the Trans Mountain pipeline.

Indigenous groups vow to return to court

The decision comes more than two years after cabinet last approved the project — a decision that was nullified by the Federal Court of Appeal last summer, with judges citing inadequate Indigenous consultations and an incomplete environmental review process.

The court decision placed the federal government in the awkward position of being both the owner of the project — it bought it for $4.5 billion amid investor uncertainty — and the entity tasked with approving construction permits.

'... we will be appealing this decision ...' Duration 0:50 Chief Leah George-Wilson of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation says she is disappointed with the approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline and will be appealing the decision.

That shock decision forced the government and its Crown consultation teams back to the table with Indigenous communities along the project's route. While the vast majority of First Nations communities have accepted the project and signed impact benefit agreements with the proponent — now a Crown-owned entity — some have flagged potentially devastating effects of a spill on their traditional lands or in their waters as a risk factor demanding more accommodations.

Other First Nations, notably those in B.C.'s lower mainland, have called for the project to be killed outright.

The government tasked retired Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci with leading the team of 60 consultants who fanned out across Alberta and B.C. to meet with First Nations and Métis communities to document concerns and put forward recommendations — beyond the 156 conditions already proposed by the NEB — that could mitigate the effects of this project.

While the final outcome was essentially a foregone conclusion, the strings cabinet would attach to its conditional approval of the project were unknown.

The cabinet accepted all of the 156 conditions and took, according to officials, the ""unprecedented step"" of actually amending six of those NEB conditions to ""make them stronger and better,"" including strengthened marine and emergency response plans with far more Indigenous participation.

The cabinet also is proposing eight new additional ""accommodation measures"" to address specific Indigenous concerns, including the Salish Sea Initiative to curb the impact of increased tanker traffic on the southern resident killer whale population and the Quiet Vessel Initiative to reduce noise pollution.

The positive cabinet decision is far from the last hurdle facing the project, first pitched by its former proponent Kinder Morgan in 2014. Now, the Crown corporation, accountable to Parliament through the Canada Development Investment Corporation, will have to work with the NEB to finalize the project's route through a series of regulatory hearings.

The possibility of further litigation from environmentalists and First Nations is always a risk.

Unsatisfied with the government's promised fixes, Chief Leah George-Wilson of the Vancouver-area Tsleil-Waututh First Nation said her community would turn again to the courts to try to block the project.

""The federal government's decision to buy the pipeline and become the owner makes it impossible to make an unbiased, open-minded decision,"" George-Wilson said. ""After consultation with our community and our council, we will be appealing this decision to the Federal Court of Appeal.""

There are are also competing Indigenous-owned entities clamouring to buy the project from Ottawa, with some floating a purchase price beyond what the federal Liberal government paid to the Texas energy infrastructure giant in the first place.

Environmental groups attacked the decision to proceed with the project. Patrick McCully, energy program director at the Rainforest Action Network, said it was ""stunningly hypocritical"" for the government to put forward a motion in the House of Commons declaring climate change a national emergency on Monday only to approve a major project like Trans Mountain on Tuesday.

""This is like declaring war on cancer and then announcing a campaign to promote smoking,"" McCully said. ""But this is far from a done deal. First Nations and Canadian environmentalists will continue to fight this project and their international allies will support them in whatever way they can.""

""The federal government has signed off on as much as an additional 15 million tonnes of carbon. This is irresponsible at a time when Canada is drifting further away from meeting our Paris climate commitment, and inconsistent with the climate emergency that was declared only yesterday,"" added Tim Gray, the executive director of Environmental Defence.

The pipeline company has already secured some 30 per cent of the needed pipeline materials to start work on some segments of the pipeline.

If built, the 1,150-kilometre expansion project would nearly triple the existing pipeline's capacity to 890,000 barrels a day.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

health minister says he won't allow Florida to 'pillage' the drug supply  CBC News,"Health Minister Mark Holland says Florida's plan to import cheaper Canadian pharmaceuticals is a non-starter and the federal government will use its regulatory power to ensure the national drug supply does not face any shortages due to actions by a foreign state.

""There is no way we will allow any jurisdiction, be it a state or another foreign jurisdiction, to endanger the Canadian drug supply. That is not an appropriate solution to whatever challenges they may be facing,"" Holland said during an official announcement in Nova Scotia of a bilateral health-care deal with the province.

""We're going to do everything in our power to make sure that another country cannot be given the ability to pillage our health system for its own benefit.""

Holland said he will soon travel to Washington, D.C. to make it known to officials there that Canada will not stand idle if Florida or other U.S. states pursue bulk imports that threaten Canadians' access to medication in any way.

He said it's ""inappropriate"" for U.S. politicians to look to Canada to help fix their costly health-care system, where sky-high drug prices are the norm.

WATCH: Canada's drug supply is 'safe,' says health minister Canada's drug supply is 'safe,' says health minister Duration 0:41 Mark Holland says he will ensure that the country's supply of pharmaceuticals is not affected by Florida's plan to import cheaper Canadian drugs.

Holland's comments come after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week approved a Florida program to import certain prescription drugs from Canada at a lower cost.

Because of limits on prescription drug price negotiations in the U.S., politicians south of the border have argued their health-care systems should simply buy more drugs from Canada.

A 2021 report by the Rand Corporation found that Canadian prices were just 46 per cent of those in the United States because Ottawa limits how much drugmakers can charge for medicines. The U.S. lets the free market dictate drug prices.

Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also vying to be his party's candidate for the U.S. presidency, has long championed the initiative.

He celebrated the FDA's decision as an opportunity for Florida to ""import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs."" DeSantis said the program will save Floridian taxpayers $180 million in the first year it's operational.

The state has said it wants initially to import drugs that treat HIV, mental illness and prostate cancer.

WATCH: Fears of shortages after U.S. allows Florida to import Canadian drugs Fears of shortages after U.S. allows Florida to import Canadian drugs Duration 2:17 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given Florida the go-ahead to buy cheaper wholesale prescription drugs from Canada, which has reignited fears of drug shortages in this country.

While Florida has the green light from U.S. regulators, it's still not clear if the state will get its hands on a meaningful quantity of drugs from Canada.

Holland said Canada has a large pharmaceutical industry that makes a number of drugs for sale overseas, and those exports will continue.

But Canada is dealing with serious supply issues of its own.

A national database suggests dozens of medications are in short supply in Canada, including popular drugs like diazepam — sold under the brand name Valium and used to treat anxiety — and opioids like hydromorphone.

""Understandably, the U.S. has its challenges with its drug supply and its costs. We will not allow the U.S. at all to use Canada as a means of fixing that problem,"" Holland said. ""We will do everything in our power to ensure shortages do not occur.""

Holland said Canada won't hesitate to use regulatory powers first introduced in 2020 to restrict bulk exports that could worsen drug shortages.

Those regulations, enacted as then-U.S. president Donald Trump was touting a drugs-from-Canada scheme, bars the distribution of certain drugs outside of Canada that would cause or worsen a shortage.

Some provincial health ministers are urging Ottawa to take decisive action now to avoid any disruptive effects.

In an interview with CBC's Rosemary Barton Live, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said what Florida and other states are proposing is ""effectively a raid on Canada's drug supply.""

Allowing one of the most populous U.S. states to scoop up already limited Canadian supply would ""clearly cause a drug shortage,"" Dix said.

B.C. has been grappling with limited quantities of the type 2 diabetes treatment Ozempic, which is being widely used off-label for obesity.

To stop diversion to the U.S., the province introduced a regulation to halt online and mail-order sales of the drug to people who do not live in Canada or are not in B.C. to make a purchase in person.

WATCH: U.S. allows Florida to import drugs from Canada, reviving fears of shortages U.S. allows Florida to import drugs from Canada, reviving fears of shortages Duration 5:52 Rosemary Barton speaks with B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix about his province's response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowing states to import prescription drugs from Canada. In recent years, Canada has run short on a range of drugs, including the popular weight-loss and diabetes drug Ozempic.

But Dix said the Ozempic case is just one example, adding Florida's plan could result in a vast quantity of drugs being sent to the U.S. if Ottawa doesn't move aggressively to curtail exports.

""In the Ozempic case, we took action. This is at a different scale altogether. We're talking about the importation of billions of dollars under the Florida scheme that has been approved by the FDA — billions of dollars of drugs,"" he said.

""We need to take action when these things come.""

NDP MP Don Davies, the party's health critic, said drug shortages have ""long been a serious problem in Canada."" Citing past shortages of things like EpiPens and children's pain medication, he said Ottawa should establish a ""public manufacturer"" of critical medications and vaccines.

Davies also said Canada ""should not be allowing the export of medicines to the U.S. unless we have a stable supply for domestic use.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

personality arrested after an encounter with Chrystia Freeland  CBC News,"Rebel News personality David Menzies was arrested Monday for allegedly assaulting a police officer while trying to ask Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland questions about the government's decision to leave the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) off the designated terrorist entity list.

The website posted a video of Menzies briefly colliding with a police officer in Richmond Hill, Ont., while trying to question Freeland about the IRGC at an event to mark the destruction of Flight PS752, a Ukrainian International Airlines jetliner that was destroyed by the Iranian military in January 2020 — an attack that killed dozens of Canadians.

The video of Monday's encounter appears to show an officer stepping into Menzies' path while the media personality was carrying his microphone in the parking lot of a suburban strip mall.

That officer subsequently grabbed Menzies by his lapels, pushed him against a wall and accused him of assault while putting him under arrest.

""Police — you're under arrest for assault. You pushed into me, sir,"" the unidentified officer said.

(Video courtesy Rebel News)

""I didn't touch a single person,"" Menzies said in response.

""This is a trumped-up charge of assault, folks. I didn't come here to cause any trouble. I came here to do my job and now I'm handcuffed. This is your Canada now, folks. This is the gestapo taking blackface's orders,"" Menzies continued — an apparent reference to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who also attended the event.

Menzies asked the officer for his name and badge number but answers to those questions — if they were provided — aren't audible on the tape.

The officer in the video was later identified by a York Regional Police spokesperson as a member of the RCMP protective detail.

""The arrest of the Rebel News reporter was made by the prime minister's RCMP security detail. York Regional Police officers assisted as the interaction took place in our region,"" the spokesperson said.

""It was determined that no credible security threat existed and the subject was released unconditionally shortly thereafter.""

A spokesperson for the RCMP said ""protective policing resources were involved in an incident while deployed on a protective operation.""

""The RCMP is looking into the incident and the actions of all parties involved. No further comment is available at this time,"" the spokesperson said.

Freeland, who has been the target of threats and tense public confrontations in the past, is routinely monitored by police for her safety.

Previous run-ins with police

The finance minister ignored Menzies' questions and did not say anything as the arrest unfolded.

Menzies is a provocative figure who has had run-ins with police and security services in the past — including an apprehension by Trudeau's protective detail at a Toronto event in 2021.

Menzies was also arrested for a 2021 encounter with now Conservative deputy leader Melissa Lantsman in Thornhill, Ont.

Lantsman, who is a lesbian, said Menzies' questions ""became homophobic and related to my sexual orientation.""

Menzies was also removed from a 2019 campaign event for then-Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.

Rebel News widely shared video of the latest incident, advertising ""SHOCK FOOTAGE"" on its website.

""Chrystia Freeland's bodyguards assault and arrest David Menzies when he asks her a question,"" said a headline on the website.

""The police lied about the assault. They're the ones who assaulted him,"" the website claimed in its post about the incident.

According to data from X, formerly Twitter, parts of the video have been seen by millions of social media users.

Rebel News founder considering legal action

Reached by email Tuesday, Ezra Levant, the founder and owner of Rebel News, said he and Menzies are considering legal action against the police for what transpired.

""We have not yet finalized our legal strategy, but at this point I would expect that we will sue both the RCMP and the York Regional Police, as well as Chrystia Freeland, for false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and assault,"" Levant told CBC News.

WATCH | Hear what the Power Panel had to say: The political optics around the arrest of Rebel News employee | Power & Politics Duration 16:15 The Mounties are facing criticism for arresting Rebel News personality David Menzies as Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland arrived at an event Monday. Charges were later dropped after police found 'no credible security threat,' York Regional Police say. The Power Panel weighs in on the political optics of the arrest.

""These government defendants will have unlimited public resources, whereas we take no public funds. Therefore we will crowdfund David's litigation.""

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre condemned the arrest, reposting a video of the incident with the message: ""This is the state of freedom of the press. In Canada. In 2024. After eight years of Trudeau.""

Conservative MP Marilyn Gladu, the party's civil liberties critic, said in a media statement she wants the House of Commons heritage committee to be recalled from its winter break to study the matter and ""demand transparency and accountability"" regarding Menzies' arrest.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

government seeking another pause on planned expansion of medical assistance in dying  CBC.ca,"The federal government has announced it is seeking another pause on medical assistance in dying (MAID) provisions that would cover those suffering solely from mental illnesses.

This is the second time the government has sought to delay the expansion of MAID since the Superior Court of Quebec struck down the government's original 2016 MAID legislation because it was limited to those whose deaths were ""reasonably foreseeable.""

Health Minister Mark Holland and Justice Minister Arif Virani made the announcement Monday outside the House of Commons. Holland said Canada's health system is still ""not ready"" for the MAID expansion.

""The system needs to be ready and we need to get it right,"" he said. ""It's clear from the conversations we've had that the system is not ready and we need more time.""

WATCH | Health minister says government is seeking delay to MAID expansion: Government wants to wait on expanding medical assistance in dying Duration 2:26 The federal government has announced it’s hitting the brakes on expanding medical assistance in dying to those suffering solely from mental health issues, saying Canada’s health system is not ready.

Holland didn't say how long the government is seeking to delay the expansion. He indicated the timeline would be outlined once the government tables new legislation.

Two government sources have told Radio-Canada the expansion won't happen before the next federal election.

New legislation passed in 2021 delayed by two years the extension of MAID to include those who suffer from mental illness. That deadline was later pushed back to March 17 of this year.

A special committee, made up of 15 MPs and senators, was tasked by the federal government last fall with determining whether the health-care system is prepared for the expansion.

After hearing from dozens of witnesses, the committee released a report Monday concluding that Canada is not ready for such an expansion.

Although the committee noted that some steps have been taken to prepare for the expansion — including the development of national guidelines — it questioned whether there are enough trained practitioners, including psychiatrists, to assess patients and administer MAID for those with mental illnesses.

The report said assisted dying for those with mental illnesses should be delayed until the government is ""satisfied, based on recommendations from their respective departments and in consultation with their provincial and territorial counterparts and with Indigenous Peoples, that it can be safely and adequately provided.""

Holland said the government will table its response to the report. He added he agrees with the committee.

""Although the guidelines are set, there has not been enough time for people to be trained on them. Provinces and territories are saying their systems are not ready and need more time,"" he said.

Conservative MP Michael Cooper, a member of the special committee, called on the government to pause the expansion indefinitely. He pointed to testimony from psychiatrists who told the committee it would be difficult — if not impossible — for medical professionals to decide whether a mental illness is beyond treatment.

""Kicking the can down the road … is completely insufficient,"" he said. ""I don't see any indication that the fundamental issues that are at the heart — or should be at the heart — of putting a pause on this expansion will be resolved.""

Three senators from the committee – Sen. Stan Kutcher, Sen. Marie-Françoise Mégie and Sen. Pamela Wallin – wrote a dissenting report arguing that delaying the expansion would discriminate against those suffering from mental illness.

""This is genuinely a matter of life and death. The government should not renege on its promise to respect an individual's right to choose,"" Wallin said in a statement.

Dying with Dignity Canada called on the government to quickly present a ""clear plan of action"" for moving forward.

""For the people across the country who live with treatment-resistant mental disorders who have patiently waited for this change in Canada's MAID law, Dying With Dignity Canada is disheartened and shares the frustration of the continued exclusion, stigmatization and discrimination based on diagnosis,"" the advocacy group said in a media statement.

Asked about those with mental illnesses who have been waiting to access MAID, Holland said he ""cannot imagine their circumstance"" but insisted the government needs to ensure the health-care system is prepared for the expansion.

""I have not had the opportunity to directly talk with such individuals, but I have an opportunity to talk to their physicians and it's an absolute nightmare and it's horrid that anybody could be in that circumstance,"" he said.

""This is going to mean those individuals are going to have to wait a little longer. But I think those individuals would understand the broader need to get it right and make sure our system is prepared.""

The government will have to pass new legislation in order to push the deadline back again. Holland said legislation will be tabled ""imminently"" and Virani said they're aiming to pass it before the deadline.

""We understand the necessity of acting quickly because of the date that is currently prescribed in legislation,"" Virani said. ""We intend on meeting that deadline.""

Health Canada reported 13,241 people received medically assisted deaths in 2022 — a 31.2 per cent jump over 2021.

Bance, Conservative caught peeing in mug, no longer candidate, party says  CBC.ca","Jerry Bance was service technician when caught on CBC-TV's Marketplace in 2012 urinating in mug and dumping contents into sink

A service technician caught on hidden camera urinating into a coffee mug during a 2012 house call to repair a leaky sink before he became a Conservative election candidate is no longer running, the Tories said today.

Jerry Bance ""is no longer a candidate,"" said Conservative spokesman Stephen Lecce in a brief email to CBC News on Monday.

Lecce later confirmed to CBC News that Bance was dropped for not being truthful during the candidate screening process.

Lecce did not provide any further details, such as who might replace Bance as Conservative candidate in the Toronto-area battleground riding of Scarborough–Rouge Park.

Bance was filmed during an episode of CBC-TV's investigative series Marketplace. He is seen peeing into a coffee cup before dumping its contents into the sink he was supposed to be fixing.

Jerry Bance was the Conservative candidate in Scarborough-Rouge Park, until he was identified as the repair technician caught on camera peeing in a customer's coffee mug in a 2012 CBC Marketplace sting. (Conservative.ca)

A service technician for the last 25 years, he had been called to the home as part of a sting operation to catch and confront repairmen overcharging homeowners for simple repairs to home appliances. Hidden cameras captured the incident, which occurred while a Marketplace producer posing as a homeowner was in the next room.

Bance had also run as a Conservative in 2006 and 2008. Jason Kenney, the high-profile Conservative minister and candidate from Alberta, helped him kick off his current campaign last week.

The original Marketplace episode had referred to Bance — who owns and operates XPress Appliance Service, an appliance repair company in the Greater Toronto Area — only as ""Jerry."" A tip received by CBC News late Sunday night pointed out Jerry is Bance.

The Tories' split with Bance was followed just hours later by news that the party had dropped another Toronto candidate, Tim Dutaud, after YouTube videos surfaced of Dutaud making prank phone calls that included derogatory comments about people with disabilities.

Speaking during a campaign stop in Toronto Monday afternoon, Conservative Leader Stephen Harper faced questions from media about both candidates but offered little in response.

""What this says is that we keep the highest standards for candidates and that these two individuals are no longer candidates,"" he said.

In a statement released Sunday evening, Bance said ""the footage from that day does not reflect who I am as a professional or a person.

This must be someone who's adept at Stephen Harper's trickle-down theory of economics. - NDP Leader Tom Mulcair

""I deeply regret my actions on that day.""

Response to the story on social media sites was nearly instantaneous. The hashtag ""peegate"" was soon trending on Twitter, as Twitter buzzed with disparaging jokes, comments and bad puns targeting Bance and the Conservative Party.

The Conservatives' political rivals took the opportunity to make a few jokes at Bance's expense.

""I guess that this was one mugshot that Canadians weren't expecting from the Conservatives,"" said NDP Leader Tom Mulcair.

Mulcair was speaking to reporters at the annual Labour Day parade in Toronto, where he's spending the day campaigning for the Oct. 19 vote.

Tom Mulcair has some fun with latest Conservative resignation Duration 0:27 NDP Leader Tom Mulcair cracks a couple of jokes over the resignation of a conservative candidate who had been caught on camera urinating into a coffee mug while he worked as a service technician.

""This must be someone who's adept at Stephen Harper's trickle-down theory of economics,"" Mulcair said smirking. ""Any other questions?""

Speaking Monday evening at a campaign event in Summerside, P.E.I., Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said the incidents show Harper is out of touch and ""didn't bother"" to find out the past of two of his candidates.

""And he lost them today,"" Trudeau said of the candidates, before slipping in a barb to the local crowd over suspended Senator Mike Duffy's residency troubles.

investigating massive security breach at Global Affairs Canada  CBC.ca,"Canadian authorities are investigating a prolonged data security breach following the ""detection of malicious cyber activity"" affecting the internal network used by Global Affairs Canada staff, according to internal department emails viewed by CBC News.

The breach affects at least two internal drives, as well as emails, calendars and contacts of many staff members.

CBC News spoke to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, including employees who have received instructions on how the breach affects their ability to work. Some were told to stop working remotely as of last Wednesday.

CBC News has also seen three internal emails sent to Global Affairs staff.

""Forensic work has also progressed to help us understand the scope of the data breach,"" one email said. ""The work is ongoing, but early results suggest that many (Global Affairs Canada) users may have been affected.""

Another email said the internal systems were vulnerable between December 20, 2023 and January 24, 2024. It informed anyone who connected remotely using a SIGNET (Secure Integrated Global Network) laptop that their information may be vulnerable.

The ""compromised"" system was the virtual private network (VPN) staff use to access Global Affairs's Ottawa headquarters. The VPN system was managed by Shared Services Canada, the GAC notice said.

Shared Services Canada is a federal department created in 2011 to take over the delivery of email, data centres and network services for many government departments and agencies.

Global Affairs Canada confirms breach

In a statement issued Tuesday, Global Affairs Canada said an ""unplanned IT outage"" is affecting remote access to its network. The department said the partial outage was activated intentionally on Jan. 24 to ""address the discovery of malicious cyber activity.""

""Early results indicate there has been a data breach and that there has been unauthorized access to personal information of users including employees,"" the statement said, adding that the department is investigating the matter and contacting those affected to ensure their information is secure.

The statement also said connectivity in GAC buildings is fully functioning and that employees working remotely in Canada have been provided with workarounds.

""The department's critical services and external communication channels remain accessible and operational.""

No word yet on scope of data breach

According to Global Affairs, SIGNET is the department's secure computer network. One part of the network holds personal information on shared drives, including employees' personal information. Another part holds classified information.

It's not clear whether secret information was lost in the breach, which lasted longer than a month. It's also not clear who was behind the breach.

Email traffic and files on personal and shared drives ""may have been compromised,"" a GAC memo to staff said. GAC also said it's looking into whether ""sensitive corporate information,"" such as credit cards and banking data, may have been breached.

WATCH | Authorities investigate data security breach at Global Affairs Canada: Authorities investigating massive security breach at Global Affairs Canada Duration 2:00 Authorities are investigating a major data security breach Global Affairs Canada that included 'unauthorized access to the personal information of users, including employees.'

Shared Services Canada and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security — which is part of the Communications Security Establishment, Canada's cyber-security organization — are investigating the breach, GAC's email to staff said.

""Forensic work, including with these partners, is ongoing to help us understand the impact on our networks and any potential changes in the scope and in the time frame of the data breach,"" the GAC email to staff read.

The office of the Privacy Commissioner said Global Affairs Canada informed it of a data breach on Jan. 26.

""We are in ongoing communication with the department to gather more information,"" a spokesman said in a media statement. ""Following a breach notification, our office will work with federal institutions to better understand privacy risks related to the breach and ensure that the department undertakes appropriate steps, including notification of affected individuals.""

Global Affairs is a 'natural target'

""A breach of that duration is bound to be serious,"" said Wesley Wark, a national security expert at the University of Ottawa.

""Global Affairs Canada holds a lot of classified and sensitive information ... It is a natural target for hacking but it's also vulnerable and holds important data.""

Although sensitive diplomatic cables are sent using an encrypted system, a source told CBC News that some drafts of sensitive correspondence and some intelligence may have been stored in the affected drives.

""We know this information may be unsettling for many of you,"" said the email sent to staff. ""This is an evolving situation and further information and guidance will continue to be shared as quickly as possible.""

The email offers suggestions on how to safeguard ""sensitive information"" and encourages employees to monitor financial accounts in case of unauthorized activity.

In the interim, some Canada-based Global Affairs employees with security clearance are not able to work from home.

""This is not a permanent change to the hybrid work model, just a temporary situation until this crisis passes,"" the email said.

A senior diplomatic source told CBC News that on several occasions in the past year, staff were told to immediately change passwords or reboot software but were not given any further details.

Global Affairs said it's working with Shared Services Canada and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, which is part of the Communications Security Establishment, to restore full connectivity ""as soon as possible.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

rules, mandatory use of ArriveCAN, mask mandates on planes and trains to end on Oct. 1  CBC.ca","The federal government says it's dropping all COVID-19 measures at borders on Saturday, meaning travellers will no longer need to provide proof of vaccination when entering Canada or wear masks on planes and trains.

As of Oct. 1, all travellers, regardless of citizenship, will no longer have to:

Submit public health information through the ArriveCAN app or website;

Provide proof of vaccination;

Undergo pre- or on-arrival testing;

Carry out COVID-19-related quarantine or isolation;

Monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms of COVID-19 upon arriving to Canada;

Undergo health checks for travel on air and rail;

Or wear masks on planes and trains.

Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Monday's decision is not a sign Canada is out of the pandemic, but said the government's data showed the importation of new variants was no longer having an effect on the evolution of the virus in country.

WATCH | Canada drops masks on planes and trains:

Canada dropping COVID-19 travel rules including masks Duration 1:59 The federal government has announced that travellers will no longer need to provide proof of vaccination when entering Canada or wear masks on planes and trains starting on Oct. 1.

""If anybody believes the pandemic is over, I invite them to visit a hospital,"" he said.

""That decision again was driven by the evidence that we have seen over the last few weeks and months, which is that the transmission and cost of transmission of COVID-19 on our health-care workers, hospitals and including those patients who have seen backlogs in their surgeries and treatments over the last two years and a half ... are now almost entirely driven by domestic transmission of COVID-19. That's where we need to invest our energy.""

The measures also apply to cruise ships so passengers will no longer be required to take pre-board tests, be vaccinated or use ArriveCAN. The government said guidelines will remain in place to protect passengers and crew, keeping in step with the United States.

The move comes after MPs and border-city mayors published an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden last week asking them to end the ""unnecessary"" rules at the border, a move they say would allow border communities to recover economically from the pandemic.

On Monday, Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati said he's glad the federal government is dropping all pandemic border measures but fears American tourists will continue to bypass Canada in the future.

""This should have happened at the beginning of the tourism season. We were devastated here in Niagara Falls,"" he said.

""A lot of the travelling public have decided to go elsewhere this past summer. Our concern is that they enjoyed it and want to continue it.""

The head of the Canadian Airports Council said the organization is relieved to know its members can return to normal operations.

""The aviation industry was hard-hit over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and has been forced to operate under a complicated and constantly shifting series of restrictions and regulations for over two years,"" said president Monette Pasher in a media statement.

WATCH | COVID-19 border measures dropped 'a little late': Niagara Falls mayor

COVID-19 border measures dropped 'a little late:' Niagara Falls mayor Duration 5:53 Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati says he's glad the federal government is dropping all pandemic border measures, but is worried American tourists will continue to bypass Canada in the future.

Duclos said those concerns also weighed on the government's decision to lift the measures.

""When making those decisions, we are mindful of the challenges and the cost that border communities have been facing over the last few weeks and months. It has been hard for them,"" he said.

""My colleagues and all members of our caucus have felt that and listened to them.""

The health minister didn't rule out reinstating restrictions if they are needed to keep Canadians safe.

Masks still recommended: Njoo

While masks will soon no longer be mandatory, Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief health officer, said he still recommends that people wear masks on planes and trains.

""The science is clear: wearing a mask is clearly a means of personal protection that is extremely effective,"" he said.

""I hope Canadians will make an enlightened decision about this.""

WATCH | One of Canada's top doctors urges Canadians to keep wearing masks:

One of Canada's top doctors encourages continued masking Duration 1:09 Dr. Howard Njoo, the deputy chief public health officer of Canada, urges Canadians to continue wearing masks in 'certain contexts' despite the latest removal of mask mandates.

Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said the ArriveCan app can still be used by travellers to submit customs declarations in advance at major airports. That option is available at international airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, but there are plans to expand to airports in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Quebec City, Halifax and the Billy Bishop airport in Toronto.

The government also said the Canada Border Services Agency is looking at adding features to ArriveCan, like border wait times.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was quick to claim the decision as a victory.

""After constant pressure from Conservatives [and] people across Canada, Trudeau Liberals finally back down on the disastrous ArriveCAN app, unscientific vaccine mandates and forced mask-wearing,"" he tweeted Monday.

""None of the science changes October 1 but because of you, Trudeau has to. Let's keep it up.""

brushes off opposition calls to cancel China climate trip  CBC.ca,"Canada's environment minister travels to China today to attend diplomatic meetings with an international group that advises Beijing on climate change — and he's ignoring opposition calls for him to quit the group and call out China over human rights abuses and alleged interference in Canadian elections.

Steven Guilbeault is attending the annual general meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED), along with representatives of the United Nations, from Aug. 28 to 30 in Beijing.

In an interview with CBC News before his departure, Guilbeault stopped short of committing to bringing up China's interference in Canadian democracy and its human rights record during his trip.

""We will confront them when we have to confront them,"" Guilbeault said Friday. ""But we will also cooperate on issues like climate change and nature.""

Canada helped to establish the CCICED in the early 1990s to help China with its environmental challenges.

The Conservative Party of Canada is calling on Guilbeault to immediately resign as executive vice chair of that group and cut its funding.

""Canada's leaders should not hold formal positions in groups run by foreign governments,"" the party said in a media statement.

""If Minister Guilbeault insists on travelling to Beijing, he should firmly and vocally denounce Beijing's interference in Canada's democracy.""

Ottawa has earmarked $16 million for the council from 2017 until 2026, according to Guilbeault's office.

There's 'no solution' without China: Guilbeault

Guilbeault called the Conservatives' position ""extremely hypocritical."" He said former Conservative environment minister Peter Kent, a longtime cabinet colleague of the party's current leader Pierre Poilievre, held the same position on the CCICED and visited China for council meetings.

""There is no solution to tackle climate change without involving all the large emitters around the world, and that certainly includes China,"" Guilbeault said.

""There is no solution to the global nature and biodiversity crisis without working with countries like India, China and Brazil, and that's exactly what I'm doing.""

Jonathan Pedneault, deputy leader of the Green Party of Canada, says Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault should reconsider his trip to China. (Submitted by Green Party of Canada)

Jonathan Pedneault, deputy leader of the Green Party of Canada, said Guilbeault is the one who is being hypocritical.

Pedneault pointed out that China buys almost 50 per cent of coal exported by Canada and urged the minister to stop selling the fossil fuel.

""We benefit from China being a polluter,"" Pedneault told CBC News.

""It's a bit cynical that Minister Guilbeault will now be going to China to give lessons or engage in climate diplomacy at a time when we are failing to meet our own targets on emission reductions.""

Guilbeault is expected to follow up with China on the commitment it and other nations made last December during the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal to protect 30 per cent of global land and water by 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a US$100 billion fund to help poorer countries adapt to climate change.

But the meetings aren't expected to lead to a major breakthrough.

First trip by Canadian minister to China since 2019

Henri-Paul Normandin, a former diplomat who helped to establish the CCICED in 1992 under former Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney, called Guilbeault's trip a step forward in re-engaging China.

This is the first visit by a Canadian cabinet minister to China since 2019.

Normandin said Guilbeault should seize the opportunity to address serious issues impeding Canada-China relations on the margins of the council's discussions.

""If you want to speak truth to power in China, you have to deal with Communist Party officials,"" Normandin said.

""There's no way around it. Otherwise, just stay home.""

Normandin said the CCICED was formed in the early 1990s at a time when China was struggling with pollution, landslides and flooding caused by construction and land erosion.

China turned to Canada for ideas and policy advice on environmental management.

""That was really a bold initiative in terms of the collaboration between China and the international community,"" Normandin said.

""Those were the days when there was trust between China and Canada. We enjoyed a rather good relationship based on mutual respect and confidence. Sure, there were some issues, like human rights and so on, but there was a high level of trust. Of course, that is not there anymore today.""

Since then, relations have soured over flashpoints like China's detention of Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, more recent allegations of interference in Canadian federal elections and Beijing's grim human rights record.

Li Shuo, a senior Greenpeace policy adviser based in Beijing, said the primary goal of the council should be to reduce China's coal addiction, which makes up the lion's share of the country's carbon emissions.

""China is an indispensable player when it comes to solving global emission issues,"" Shuo said.

""We have to engage with China. The China council serves as a good platform to do that.""

China remains the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world.

The 2016 Paris Agreement committed countries to working toward limiting warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, but the planet is close to surpassing that target.

The world has already warmed by at least 1.1 C and 1.3 C, causing an increase in deadly wildfires, droughts and floods.

Natural disasters are expected to worsen unless there is a dramatic course correction, according to the scientific consensus on climate change.

Global climate pledges have placed the world on track for a temperature rise of between 2.4 C and 2.6 C by 2100, according to the UN.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

unlock public properties to build 29,200 housing units by 2029  CBC.ca","As the federal government faces mounting pressure to address a national housing crisis, it announced Tuesday that it will allow more than 2,800 homes to be built on six of its surplus properties across Canada.

""These are significant steps forward, but we know we need to do more,"" Procurement Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said.

The Liberals have been making a series of housing announcements in the lead-up to the fall economic statement, at a time when the Conservatives — and their focus on affordability — have been riding high in opinion polls.

This latest commitment would put the federal government back on track to the development of about 29,200 housing units on federal lands by 2029.

Canada Lands Co., the Crown corporation that manages federal properties, is setting a new minimum target for housing projects so that at least 20 per cent of units must be affordable, Duclos said.

This target will come into play when there is no municipal target for affordable housing already in place, or when that target is lower.

The Crown corporation said an average of 10 per cent of the residential units it enabled to be built were affordable, but its new strategic plan has set a more ambitious goal.

The corporation expects to enable the construction of about 26,400 units over the next five years, Duclos said.

WATCH | Premiers call housing a 'massive issue' that requires collaboration: Premiers call housing a 'massive issue' that requires collaboration Duration 2:28 After meeting with provincial and territorial partners, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith both say housing is a top priority for collaboration with the federal government.

""This will mean around 5,300 affordable homes in the next five years, which is twice as many as in the last 30 years,"" he said.

""This is a significant acceleration of providing affordable homes to Canadians but we think — and we know — there is more we can do.""

Canada Lands Co., through agreements with developers, will be unlocking six federal surplus properties to allow the construction of 2,800 additional units by March 2024 in Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa and St. John's, N.L.

That initial amount is expected to include a minimum of 300 units set aside for affordable housing, as the 20 per cent target applies across all projects countrywide, not individual projects.

The announcement on Tuesday noted, for example, that the developments in Edmonton and Ottawa would include affordable homes, while none were listed for the projects in Calgary and St. John's.

When asked whether the federal government will sell off these properties or keep them on its books, Duclos said a mix of strategies may be used.

Number of units insufficient, expert says

Tuesday's announcement is the latest effort by the federal government to address the national housing crisis by boosting housing supply.

Mike Moffatt, the senior director of policy and innovation at the Smart Prosperity Institute, said the federal government has taken bolder action on housing over the last few months.

But while getting more homes built on federal lands is a good step, the number of units that will be built pales in comparison to what's needed to address the shortage, he said.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. estimates the country needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2030 — above the projected pace of building — to restore affordability.

""A few thousand here and there, while they certainly help, are just a very small move in the right direction,"" Moffatt said.

The federal Liberals' attempt to get ahead on the housing file comes as the government faces attacks from opposition parties over the affordability crisis.

Conservatives have seen their support in polling surge since the summer as the party's leader, Pierre Poilievre, pins the blame for the housing crisis on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

WATCH | Federal housing minister says he'll continue to work with cities: Ottawa has 'no reasonable excuse' to stop working with cities on housing: Fraser Duration 1:12 After provincial premiers threatened to make it harder for the federal government to deal directly with municipalities on housing, Housing Minister Sean Fraser said he has 'no appetite to slow down' on building homes.

Among Poilievre's proposed solutions to the crisis is a pitch to sell off 15 per cent of federal buildings and lands for housing development.

The NDP has also criticized the federal government for its handling of housing policy, calling for more targeted investments in affordable housing, in particular.

Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, who was present at the news conference, said this announcement ""is just the beginning of a much more aggressive approach to using federal lands.""

Housing experts have been calling on the federal government to leverage its real-estate portfolio to get more homes built, particularly ones that would be affordable for lower-income Canadians.

Freeland is expected to present a fall economic statement in the coming weeks, and has promised the mini-budget would focus on housing and affordability.

One of the political challenges facing the federal government is that any new measures aimed at boosting the housing supply will take time to show results.

That means even if the Liberals introduce the right policies to speed up construction, Canadians may not see the benefits by the time there's another federal election.

Faced with this challenge, Moffatt said the Liberals may want to look at other policies to help with the affordability crisis at hand.

""I do think there's room to look at areas like rent supplements, like looking at increases in GST cheques, and those kinds of things, to make sure that people can afford to pay the rent,"" Moffatt said.

""You do need a suite of policies to recognize that we're not going to fix the supply crisis overnight and people are struggling today.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

Foundation president, board resign, citing 'politicization' of China-linked donation  CBC.ca","The Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation's president and board of directors have resigned en masse, citing the charity's entanglement in the ongoing foreign interference controversy.

In a statement, the foundation said that a $200,000 donation in 2016 from a businessman linked to the Chinese government ""has put a great deal of pressure on the foundation's management and volunteer board of directors, as well as on our staff and our community.""

The charity announced last month that it would return the donation. The Conservatives criticized the government over the matter, saying the donation compromised a government report on the integrity of the 2021 federal election.

""The circumstances created by the politicization of the foundation have made it impossible to continue with the status quo, and the volunteer board of directors has resigned, as has the president and CEO,"" the statement said.

WATCH | CEO, board of directors at Trudeau Foundation resign en masse: Mass exodus at Trudeau foundation over ‘politicization’ Duration 2:36 The president and entire board of directors at the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation resigned Tuesday over what they call ‘politicization,’ partly linked to a 2016 donation from a Chinese donor.

The foundation is independent and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has no involvement with it.

""The Trudeau Foundation is a foundation with which I have absolutely no intersection,"" Trudeau told a news conference Tuesday.

""It is a shame to see the level of toxicity and political polarization that is going on in our country these days, but I am certain that the Trudeau Foundation will be able to continue to ensure that research into the social studies and humanities at the highest levels across Canadian academic institutions continues for many years to come.""

The charity, established in 2001 to honour former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, funds scholarships, mentorships and fellowships.

Statement from the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation - Resignation of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO<a href=""https://t.co/q3iT3KwpUQ"">https://t.co/q3iT3KwpUQ</a> <a href=""https://t.co/e3O9xn4SY4"">pic.twitter.com/e3O9xn4SY4</a> —@fdnPETF

Last month, Prime Minister Trudeau appointed former governor general David Johnston as a special rapporteur to investigate foreign interference in Canadian elections and institutions, including alleged meddling by the Chinese government.

The Conservatives have questioned Johnston's impartiality, in part by pointing to Johnston's former role as a member of the Trudeau Foundation. Foundation members are responsible for appointing the board of directors.

Johnston resigned from the foundation following his appointment as special rapporteur. Trudeau has defended the choice, citing Johnston's long career in public service.

The statement said three directors will remain on an interim basis to continue the charity's work while a new board is appointed. The foundation's website currently lists six members of the board of directors.

Its president and CEO, Pascale Fournier, had been in the position for almost five years.

Poilievre calls for investigation

Reacting to news of the resignations Tuesday morning, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called for an investigation into the charity.

""We need to investigate the Beijing-funded Trudeau Foundation,"" Poilievre tweeted.

""We need to know who got rich, who got paid and who got privilege and power from Justin Trudeau as a result of funding to the Trudeau Foundation.""

Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said the resignations make the 2016 donation look more suspicious. He called on Johnston to step down as special rapporteur and for the government to call a public inquiry into foreign interference.

""Nothing else will do,"" Blanchet said in a French statement.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he won't comment on the Trudeau Foundation specifically. He repeated his calls for a public inquiry.

WATCH | Singh repeats call for public inquiry after Trudeau Foundation president, board resign: Singh repeats call for public inquiry after Trudeau Foundation president, board resign Duration 0:57 During a press conference at St. Clair College in Windsor, Ont., NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is asked about the resignation of the president and board of directors of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation. A statement from the foundation said ‘the circumstances created by the politicization of the foundation have made it impossible to continue with the status quo.’

""What we've seen from both the Liberals and the Conservatives, they're more interested in scoring political points, pointing fingers at each other,"" Singh told a news conference.

""When it comes to something as serious as our democracy, the goal shouldn't be to score points … We've been saying we need a public inquiry to get to the truth, to give Canadians confidence.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

Canada reports record population growth, more than 430,000 in Q3  CBC.ca","Canada's population grew by more than 430,000 during the third quarter, marking the fastest pace of population growth in any quarter since 1957.

Statistics Canada released its Oct. 1 population estimates on Tuesday, putting the number at more than 40.5 million.

The agency says the population growth over the first nine months of 2023 has already surpassed the total growth in any other full year, including the record set in 2022.

That has been fuelled by international migration, including about 313,000 non-permanent residents who came to the country from July to September.

StatsCan says those non-permanent residents were mostly work and study permit-holders, and to a lesser extent refugee claimants.

Experts have been warning that the strong pace of population growth in Canada is eroding housing affordability, given the country has struggled to ramp up home construction.

Earlier this month, Bank of Canada deputy governor Toni Gravelle gave a speech on the effect of immigration on the economy and inflation in particular.

Gravelle acknowledged there are many benefits to this rise in immigration, noting it has helped grow the economy, expand the workforce and counteract an aging population.

But he warned it's also adding pressure to a housing market riddled with challenges, including zoning restrictions and a shortage of construction workers.

WATCH | Immigration drives Canada's population to 40M Immigration drives Canada's population to 40M Duration 1:52 Canada's population has hit 40 million people. The historic pace of the increase is being driven by immigration and the need for workers, but it's also causing the already dire housing crisis to get even worse.

""This jump in demographic demand coupled with the existing structural supply issues could explain why rent inflation continues to climb in Canada. It also helps explain, in part, why housing prices have not fallen as much as we had expected,"" Gravelle told the Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce.

Polling suggests Canadians are quite concerned about the impact immigration is having on infrastructure and services in the country.

In a Leger poll last month, about three-quarters of respondents agreed the increase in immigrants is adding strain to both the housing market and health-care system.

Compared to March 2022, the percentage of Canadians who said they want the country to welcome more immigrants than it has in the past had fallen from 17 per cent to nine per cent.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

Canada's worst airline when it comes to passenger complaints, federal data shows  CBC.ca","Ultra low-cost carrier Flair is Canada's worst airline for complaints, with more than 20 per cent of its flights generating some sort of complaint to the Canadian Transport Agency (CTA), new federal data shows.

While gripes about air travel are not unusual, the CTA, the quasi-judicial body that regulates air transportation, found Flair had the dubious distinction of trailing all other major carriers on customer satisfaction in the first quarter of 2023.

In the January-March period, the CTA received 20.9 complaints for every 100 Flair flights. That compares to 10.7 for WestJet and 5.8 for Air Canada.

Other low-cost carriers — which generally charge less for fares, only to add on ancillary fees for things like seat selection, baggage and live-agent customer service — performed better than Flair despite a similar business model.

Lynx, a fledgling Calgary-based carrier, had 5.2 complaints per 100 flights.

Sunwing, a leisure airline that was recently acquired by WestJet, was the second-worst carrier for complaints after Flair — it generated 17.4 complaints for every 100 flights, said the CTA. Swoop, WestJet's discount sister brand, was the subject of 16 complaints per 100 flights.

Flair's poor showing doesn't come as a surprise to some of its customers.

There's a dedicated Facebook group — Flair Airlines Nightmares — that has over 10,000 members who trade horror stories about flying with the carrier.

The complaints are different but there's one common thread: lacklustre or non-existent customer service.

Passengers are often grappling with last-minute flight cancellations, hours-long delays, lost bags and rebooked flights that are days or weeks out from the original date of departure.

Sometimes, Flair has put passengers on planes headed to airports that were not their original destinations.

What's unique about Flair, passengers say, is its inadequate level of communication.

Third-party contract airport workers are powerless to help with some issues.

Call centre wait times are particularly egregious, passengers claim. Customer complaints are usually handled by email.

Passengers are often directed to an automated chatbot on the airline's website, a tool disgruntled Flair travellers say is essentially useless.

What's missing is adequate access to a real person who can actually help solve a problem, Flair customers say.

Ken Elmes was one of those unlucky travellers.

'The whole thing is a mess'

In an interview with CBC News, Elmes recounted being stranded in Saint John, N.B. His flight from Toronto went off without a hitch — the return was a different story.

The flight home was cancelled at the last minute, he said. Elmes and his wife were automatically rebooked on a flight ten days later.

""We're like, what? Ten days? I'd never even heard of that. That's completely unacceptable,"" Elmes said.

A trip to the airport didn't solve their problem — an overworked reservation agent dealing with a group of irate passengers told Elmes she couldn't change the reservation.

""I feel sorry for their workers — she told us this happens all the time,"" he said. ""This airline, it's just not professional at all. The whole thing is a mess.""

After spending hours on hold with Flair's call centre — and realizing that other airlines were sold out on the Saint John-Toronto route — Elmes rented a one-way car rental and drove across the country to get home rather than wait for Flair to come through.

That set him back a cool $1,500 — many times more than what he paid for the airfare.

Elmes, a retiree on a fixed income, said it was an unnecessary hit to the wallet that still stings seven weeks after he got back.

He said Flair initially offered some compensation — it agreed to $688.68 — only to later renege, claiming it didn't owe him anything.

""They need to clean up their act. The transport minister, Omar Alghabra, he's got to do something,"" Elmes said. ""One thing is for sure, I'll absolutely never fly Flair again.""

While executives from Air Canada, WestJet and Sunwing were hauled before a House of Commons committee earlier this year to account for the disastrous state of air travel over Christmas, Flair's leaders weren't on the witness list.

That's not because it had a sterling record over the holidays.

In the October-December 2022 period, Flair was second only to Sunwing — which stranded hundreds of passengers in Mexico over the holidays — in terms of complaints to the CTA.

In fact, since the CTA started publishing data, Flair has always been either the first- or second-worst airline for reported complaints.

'Am I going to be stranded?'

Blane Johnson, a sales representative from Meaford, Ont., has a story to tell about Flair's mismanagement.

He said his trip to Florida was ruined after a series of flight delays left him and his brother waiting hours at the airport.

They could cope with the nine-hour delay, he said, but the main issue was Flair's abrupt decision to rebook Kitchener-bound passengers on a Toronto flight with no other option to get out of Orlando.

""They sent me to a completely different city. Toronto — that's really quite far from Kitchener,"" he said. ""So, I'm sitting there thinking, am I going to be stranded in Toronto for the night? I'm from the country, I didn't know if anyone was willing to drive me in the middle of the night.""

Luckily, an Uber was willing to make the trip to the Kitchener airport so he and his brother could pick up their stranded vehicle for the drive back to their final destination on the shores of Lake Huron.

Under air passenger protection regulations, delayed passengers like Johnson are entitled to some compensation.

He said he tried to get Flair to at least cover part of his Uber. He was offered a meagre amount. Now he's gone to the CTA to fight for more money.

He'll be waiting a while. The CTA is overwhelmed with complaints from air passengers, with more than 46,000 cases currently in the queue.

The rocky post-COVID restart to air travel prompted an avalanche of complaints, forcing the CTA to warn travellers it will take at least 18 months for a complaint to be reviewed.

'Not worth the headache'

That's a timeline that the government itself has said is unacceptable.

""Flair just doesn't act like a professional organization. I would never fly them again. It's not worth the headache,"" Johnson said.

Vianney Godbout is a Montreal-area real estate agent.

After an enjoyable cruise through Alaska, Godbout was booked to fly home on Flair from Vancouver. There were hours-long delays, he said, but the flight did eventually take off.

Godbout's problem is that he still hasn't received his baggage. He said he's been waiting for more than two weeks.

Godbout didn't just have clothes and toiletries in that suitcase. The airline has misplaced the CPAP machine he needs to sleep and his pricey MacBook laptop.

Flair has been ""useless"" and has been giving him the runaround or simply ignoring his requests for a status update, he said.

He said he's sent more than 25 emails, made countless calls with hours-long wait times and Flair still hasn't delivered the bag.

""It's pretty sad,"" he told CBC News. ""I've been promised a call from a superior every single day. I've never received a call. We have no clue where that bag is.

""Air Canada, WestJet — they're not great. But at least I could speak to someone. Flair, they just don't give a shit. Flair is the worst ever. That was my first and last experience with Flair.""

Flair defended its record in an emailed statement.

Last month, a Flair spokesperson said, the airline flew over 436,000 passengers with 82.1 per cent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time.

""We want every passenger to have a great experience with the airline, and the majority of our passengers do,"" a spokesperson for the airline said.

""In the last several months, we have taken concrete steps to improve our responsiveness to customers in our communication channels, and the result is more responsive communications, and faster and successful resolution of customer inquiries.""

Flair has been dogged by controversy since it transitioned in 2019-2020 from a charter and cargo carrier to an airline that runs regularly scheduled passenger flights.

Its ownership structure — U.S. interests own part of the company — has raised eyebrows at the CTA.

Last year, the regulator threatened to pull the airline's licence before eventually backing down after Flair insisted it's a Canadian-owned company, as the law requires.

Aircraft lessors have also confiscated some of Flair's planes after they alleged the Edmonton-based airline missed some payments.

In March, the Ottawa airport cut ties with Menzies, the company that provides airport services for Flair, because it said the service was bad.

The CTA data on Flair and other carriers also doesn't tell the whole story about the state of customer satisfaction — there are likely many more disgruntled air passengers who haven't bothered to go to the regulator with a complaint.

The CTA will only accept a complaint after a traveller has tried to resolve their issue directly with the airline. A complainant must wait at least 30 days for the airline to respond before they can ask the CTA to help adjudicate an issue.

""I'm not usually a helpless guy. But with Flair, I felt totally helpless,"" Elmes said.

""The government was supposedly going to fix the air passengers bill of rights. That hasn't done a thing.""

A spokesperson for Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said the government announced changes to air passenger rights regulations in April — tweaks meant to make all airlines more accountable.

""Operational decisions of an airline are the airline's responsibility. That being said, we expect all air carriers, including Flair, to uphold their obligations to keep passengers safe and protect their rights. These new changes to the APPRs will help ensure this is the case,"" the spokesperson said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

bill to regulate online streaming becomes law  CBC.ca,"The Senate has passed Bill C-11, which will force streaming platforms like Netflix and YouTube to contribute to funding Canadian content. Critics say the bill is too ambiguous, leaving many issues unresolved.

A controversial government bill to overhaul Canadian broadcasting laws to regulate streaming services has passed the final hurdle in the Senate and received royal assent Thursday evening.

After years of debate, the Senate gave its final approval Thursday to Bill C-11, also known as the Online Streaming Act. It received royal assent shortly after.

The bill makes changes to Canada's Broadcasting Act. The legislation requires streaming services, such as Netflix and Spotify, to pay to support Canadian media content like music and TV shows.

It also requires the platforms to promote Canadian content. Specifically, the bill says ""online undertakings shall clearly promote and recommend Canadian programming, in both official languages as well as in Indigenous languages.""

The changes give the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), Canada's broadcast regulator, broad powers over digital media companies, including the ability to impose financial penalties for violations of the act.

The government says the legislation is necessary to impose the same regulations and requirements in place for traditional broadcasters on online media platforms. Right now, broadcasters are required to spend at least 30 per cent of their revenue on supporting Canadian content.

""Online streaming has changed how we create, discover, and consume our culture, and it's time we updated our system to reflect that,"" a government news release on the bill says.

The Conservatives have slammed the bill as an attack on freedom of expression.

""Under this archaic system of censorship, government gatekeepers will now have the power to control which videos, posts and other content Canadians can see online,"" a Conservative webpage on C-11 says.

The public debate has been contentious, with supporters saying the bill will boost the Canadian media and arts sectors, while critics warn that the bill could over-regulate the internet.

Internet companies affected by the legislation also have criticized C-11. The online video sharing platform TikTok warned the bill could affect its users, despite the government insisting the regulations won't cover user-generated content.

""Without the legislative clarity they asked for, digital-first creators are now left to simply hope that the government keeps its promise not to regulate user-generated content,"" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.

Google, YouTube's parent company, launched a public campaign against the legislation, saying it would negatively affect users' experience on the platform.

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez, C-11's sponsor, has dismissed much of the criticism of the bill from the Conservatives and tech companies, describing it as inaccurate.

The bill's journey through Parliament has been difficult. Rodriguez tabled the legislation in the House of Commons in February 2022. Nearly a year later, the Senate sent C-11 back to the House of Commons with amendments. The House accepted most of the amendments but rejected others.

One of the most contentious points of debate is whether C-11 would apply to user-generated content, such as podcasts and online videos. The government has insisted that the legislation is not intended to regulate independent content creators.

One of the Senate's amendments would have added protections for some types of user-generated content like comedy acts and instructional videos. The House rejected that amendment, arguing that it could create loopholes for streaming giants.

The House sent the bill back to the Senate, and — after days of further debate — C-11 received formal approval from the upper chamber on Thursday.

Sen. Paula Simons voted against the bill passing, but said the argument that the bill is about censorship was ""fear mongering."" (Mike McArthur/CBC)

Sen. Paula Simons, who said she sought to quiet the firestorm of disinformation surrounding the bill, endorsed an amendment that would have added further protections for individuals who post content online.

She ultimately voted against the bill but said the claim that the bill amounts to censorship is ""fearmongering.""

""We may think it's nanny-statism to a certain extent, trying to get us to eat our vegetables. You know, eat your kale, eat your yogurt, watch your Cancon. That is not the same thing as censorship,"" she said told CBC Radio's The House in an interview airing Saturday.

Sen. Andrew Cardozo, a former CRTC commissioner, said broadcasting rules needed to be updated to address the change in technology.

""You think of TikTok five years ago, TikTok only referred to the sound that a clock made,"" he told The House.

Senator Leo Housakos said the upper chamber should've stood its ground and forced the government to accept its amendments. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

Conservative senators argued that the upper chamber should stand its ground and force the government to accept its amendments.

Sen. Leo Housakos said he was ""disappointed"" when the bill passed.

""I'm disappointed … that the Senate didn't stand its ground given the fact that we've heard from so many stakeholders that are so concerned about this piece of legislation,"" he told The House.

The government put forward a similar version of the bill in 2020 but it died when Parliament was dissolved in August 2021.

Bill's effects in practice still a mystery

The bill's broad language means it's unclear what it will do in practice — an aspect of the legislation the Senate has acknowledged.

For example, the bill says Canadian broadcasting should ""serve the needs and interests of all Canadians, including Canadians from racialized communities and Canadians of diverse ethnocultural backgrounds, socio-economic statuses, abilities and disabilities, sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and ages.""

""Precisely what this would mean in concrete terms for broadcasters is not yet known,"" a Senate page on C-11 reads.

""Another complicating factor is that the bill would give the CRTC new powers — but exactly how or even if the CRTC would make use of them cannot be determined through an analysis of the bill alone.""

But the government is expected to clarify many areas of uncertainty through a policy directive to the CRTC. A Senate amendment that the House of Commons accepted requires the CRTC to hold public consultations on how it will use its new regulatory powers.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

from trade talks with Canada  CBC.ca,"British negotiators walked away from trade talks with Canada Thursday — a dramatic development that taps the brakes on a bilateral trade deal between the two Commonwealth nations that has been years in the making.

A major sticking point between the two sides remains how much tariff-free access U.K. producers should have to the Canadian cheese market.

After Brexit, an interim agreement kept tariff-free British cheese on Canadian shelves for three years. That more permissive regime expired at the end of last year.

Negotiators had been working on a longer-term bilateral trade deal to replace the liberalized trade the U.K. enjoyed under the terms of Canada's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union.

In the aftermath of the renegotiation of the former North American Free Trade Agreement, which saw changes to supply-managed sectors, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised dairy farmers that no more slices of Canada's domestic market would be served up to exporters in future negotiations.

""We have always said we will only negotiate trade deals that deliver for the British people. And we reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made,"" a U.K. government spokesperson said in a statement to CBC News.

""We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future to build a stronger trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.""

Trade Minister Mary Ng told reporters in Ottawa Thursday afternoon that she had reached out to her British counterpart, Kemi Badenoch, to express Canada's disappointment at their decision to pause the talks.

""We are at the table. Frankly, I would say that we continue to be at the table,"" she said. ""We're always going to look for the best deal for Canadians. It's what we have always done. And this time is no different.""

""I'm very confident that we will be able to get back to the table and I would encourage my colleagues in the United Kingdom to get back to the table, because negotiating is how we get a deal.""

WATCH: Trade minister 'disappointed' by pause in trade negotiations with U.K. Trade minister ‘disappointed’ by pause in trade negotiations with U.K. Duration 1:53 Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development Mary Ng says she's ‘very confident’ the two sides will get back to the table.

Dairy farmers want to keep their supply-managed and heavily protected sector out of this deal.

Instead, representatives from the Dairy Farmers of Canada have argued the U.K. should be negotiating with the EU to recover its share (15 per cent, based on British population) of the market access Canada handed over to foreign competitors under CETA.

""How is this the Canadian government's problem to solve?"" wrote Jacques Lefebvre, DFC's CEO, in an email to CBC News.

The Canadian Cattle Association said it was ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the U.K.'s decision.

""The Canadian beef industry is a strong advocate of free and open trade. To avoid getting a bad trade deal for Canadians, we need trade partners that want to trade fairly and not use rules and regulations to their own advantage,"" president Nathan Phinney said in a statement.

Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay told reporters Canada wouldn't agree to a deal that wasn't good for Canadian farmers.

""Supply management is not on the table,"" he said, adding that the ministers would rather officials be talking at the negotiating table about these issues instead of talking to the media.

The ministers said the dairy sector is not holding up a British deal. ""There's a number of issues at the table,"" MacAulay said.

Automotive negotiations also stalled

Talks are also faltering on drafting new rules for automotive trade between the two countries.

European and Canadian-assembled automobiles enjoy preferential access to each other's consumer markets under the CETA that's been in place with the European Union since 2017. The EU deal lays out ""rules of origin"" that determine what constitutes a European automotive export for the purposes of lowering tariffs into Canada.

Since the United Kingdom is no longer part of the European Union, those rules expire on March 1. Exports from the now-independent British automotive industry are set to lose their preferential access to the Canadian market.

Automotive trade in and out of Canada is subject to a tangled web of trade agreements, each with different rules: CETA for the EU, the revised North American trade agreement for the U.S. and Mexico (known as CUSMA), the Comprehensive and Progressive agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership that liberalized automotive trade with Japan, and Canada's bilateral trade agreement with South Korea.

British vehicles risk landing outside these competitive, tariff-free supply chains if the two sides can't find a way forward.

Riskier for U.K. than for Canada?

Failure to reach a deal with Canada before these cheese and automotive deadlines pass could hurt British exports. From Canada's strategic perspective, there's less immediate economic urgency to reach a deal.

In fact, holding out responds to a key demand from Canadian livestock producers, who have urged the Canadian government not to agree to any new trade deal with the United Kingdom until food inspection standards are harmonized to recognize Canadian food safety rules as equivalent to British rules.

A specific quantity of Canadian beef and pork exports was supposed to gain access to the European and British markets when CETA took effect, but imports have been held to practically zero because Canadian standards aren't recognized as compliant.

Ng told reporters that this friction in the bilateral talks with the U.K. is a issue separate from Canada's ratification process for the British to join the CPTPP. The final terms and text for that accession were agreed to in the summer, but each current party to that trade agreement must complete its own ratification process. In Canada, that requires a parliamentary consultation process at committee and the passage of implementation legislation before cabinet ratifies the expanded treaty.

Ng said that at the moment, the government is focused on ratification of the revised Canada-Ukraine trade agreement — that bill has yet to clear Parliament.

In the absence of the bespoke bilateral agreement these negotiations were trying to land, Canada's current trade continuity agreement with the United Kingdom will stand indefinitely to keep tariffs off other products shipping between the two countries. But this ""CETA rollover"" deal was intended to be only a transitional arrangement until something more comprehensive could be worked out.

Negotiators have completed eight rounds of talks since 2022 and were scheduled to meet next month in the U.K. Those meetings now will not proceed.

The United Kingdom is Canada's third-largest trading partner, worth over $46 billion in two-way goods and services trade in 2022.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

planning to reduce volume of international students in certain provinces: source  CBC News,"The federal government is planning to reduce the volume of international students in certain provinces, according to a senior government source.

Ottawa shares jurisdiction over Canada's international student program with the provinces. The federal government issues visas for students while provincial governments are responsible for regulating colleges and universities.

The source told Radio-Canada that the government is looking at provinces that accept more international students than their housing stock can accommodate. The source specifically pointed to Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia as possible examples.

CBC is not naming the source as they are not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

The source said that the government has had discussions with some provinces about limiting the number of students in more dense areas and tightening regulations around which institutions can accept international students, but that those discussions have gone nowhere.

The federal government has said Canada was on pace to host about 900,000 international students in 2023.

Immigration Minister Marc Miller, in recent weeks, has floated the idea of a cap on temporary residents as a way to address housing affordability.

Last month, the federal government doubled the amount of money international students need to prove they have access to in order to apply for a visa. Prospective students now need to show they have access to $20,635 instead of the $10,000 requirement that had been in place for two decades.

During a press conference marking the announcement, Miller called on provinces to do more to help house international students. He also criticized lax regulations around some post-secondary institutions.

""There are, in provinces, the diploma equivalent of puppy mills that are just churning out diplomas, and this is not a legitimate student experience,"" Miller said at the news conference in December.

WATCH | Why do so many Canadian schools depend on international students? Why a foreign student cap would be ‘disastrous’ for Canada's schools Duration 5:03 The federal government says a cap on foreign student visas could help ease the housing crisis, but it could also be disastrous for some colleges and universities. CBC’s Ellen Mauro breaks down how and why so many Canadian schools rely on those lucrative international tuition fees.

In November, the government announced that, after several recent increases to its annual immigration targets, it would hold steady at a goal of 500,000 new permanent residents in 2026.

of assisted deaths jumped more than 30 per cent in 2022, report says  CBC News","A new Health Canada report says the number of medically assisted deaths in 2022 was more than 30 per cent higher than the year prior.

Medically assisted deaths constituted 4.1 per cent of all deaths in Canada last year, said the report, which was published on Tuesday .

The report is a comprehensive overview of Canada's medical assistance in dying (MAID) law and its effects. The law is set to extend access to medical assistance in dying to those whose sole medical condition is a mental illness in March 2024.

Experts and advocates who spoke with CBC News questioned whether the MAID growth rate and the percentage of deaths should be causes for concern. Some cited perceived gaps in the data.

The report says 13,241 people received medically assisted deaths in 2022 — a 31.2 per cent jump over 2021.

It says 44,958 people have received medically assisted deaths since the introduction of federal legislation in 2016.

Rebecca Vachon, the program director for health at the non-partisan Christian think tank Cardus, described the year-over-year MAID growth as ""alarming.""

Rebecca Vachon, program director for Cardus's health program. (Submitted by Rebecca Vachon)

To access MAID, an individual must have a serious illness, disease or disability which causes irreversible decline and unbearable suffering that ""cannot be relieved under conditions [the patient considers] acceptable,"" says the federal government .

""We should be ensuring that we never get to that point because we have better care available,"" Vachon said.

Jocelyn Downie is a professor at Dalhousie University who researches end-of-life law. She was also a member of the legal team representing Lee Carter and other appellants in Carter v. Canada, the Supreme Court case which ruled people with grievous and irremediable medical conditions should have the right to ask a doctor to help them die.

Downie said she doesn't think the year-over-year MAID growth is unexpected or disturbing.

""When you have something that's illegal, and it becomes legal, you are going to have an increase in the numbers,"" she said. ""And it's going to take a little while for the numbers to settle.""

Downie also said that if the only people accessing MAID are those with a ""grievous and irremediable medical condition, which is what the evidence shows, then it's not a bad thing to have more of that.""

Critics question strength of data

Vachon also criticized the portion of the report that focuses on palliative care, and called for greater investments so patients don't feel the need to request ""premature deaths.""

According to the report, palliative care is a holistic approach that treats people with serious illnesses. It includes ""physical, social, psychological, and spiritual needs as well as emotional support,"" the report says.

In 2022, MAID practitioners reported 77.6 per cent of MAID recipients — 10,169 people — received palliative care. Nearly half received it for a month or more.

Vachon said the report doesn't explain the quality of palliative care and instead uses the term as a ""checkbox"" to indicate it has been provided.

The report does not provide any metrics on the quality of palliative care, but does say that 87.5 per cent of MAID recipients who did not receive palliative care — 2,250 people — were reported to have access to the service.

The report also says more information about where palliative care was received and the types of care offered are to be included in a follow-up report in 2024.

Downie said the federal government can pursue ""parallel tracks"" by allowing MAID access while also improving care and other social services.

""One thing is just the moral argument that you don't hold individuals hostage for systemic failings,"" she said.

Jocelyn Downie, a professor at Dalhousie University who researches end-of-life law, said MAID can be offered to eligible people while other investments in care are made. (Marvin Moore)

Dr. Sonu Gaind, psychiatrist-in-chief at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, expressed concern about how the report describes people who accessed MAID whose natural deaths were not reasonably foreseeable. According to the report, 3.5 per cent of all MAID recipients — 463 people — did not have reasonably foreseeable deaths.

""The proportion of MAID recipients whose natural death was not reasonably foreseeable continues to remain very small compared to the total number of MAID recipients,"" the report says.

In 2021, just 2.2 per cent of MAID recipients — 223 people — were patients whose natural deaths were not reasonably foreseeable. Gaind said the report ""completely minimizes the numbers.""

Gaind also said the report contains no data related to equity and diversity issues or marginalized populations. According to the report, that information will be included in the 2024 report.

""They're saying that won't be recorded until next year's report,"" Gaind said. ""And yet, we're still going ahead with further expansion.""

MAID expansion set for March 2024

The new report comes as the federal government prepares to expand MAID eligibility to those whose sole underlying condition is a mental illness.

The expansion originally was planned for 2023. The federal government tabled a bill delaying the move until March 2024 to provide more time for provinces, territories and doctors to develop guidelines.

Some advocates are still concerned about the additional delay. Dr. Chantal Perrot is one of them; she's a MAID provider and board member with Dying with Dignity Canada, a charity committed to protecting end-of-life rights.

""It doesn't seem to be that there's really a will on the part of the government to follow through with this,"" Perrot said, adding government committees ""are started and then stopped"" on the issue.

Vachon, who said she was ""very concerned"" about the planned expansion, cited September polling data from Angus Reid in partnership with Cardus . In that poll, 82 per cent of respondents agreed that ""MAID eligibility should not be expanded in Canada without improving access to mental health care first.""

Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre has said a government led by him would repeal MAID for the mentally ill.

WATCH: Poilievre supports withholding MAID from people suffering solely from mental illness Conservative leader supports bill to withhold MAID from those suffering solely from mental illness Duration 0:40 Leader of the Opposition Pierre Poilievre says he is ‘pleased to support’ Conservative MP Ed Fast’s private member’s bill ‘that would ensure that medical assistance in dying is not the solution to people suffering with their mental health.’

Downie said the upcoming expansion is ""essential"" because she thinks excluding people with mental disorders on the basis of their diagnosis is ""discriminatory.""

""To exclude in that way is stigmatizing, it's paternalistic,"" Downie said. ""I don't think there's any justification for the exclusion.""

Downie said she expects an ""incredibly small number"" of people with mental disorders will get access to MAID due to the request and assessment processes.

""Many will be found not to be eligible, many will be diverted by actually getting access to different kinds of services and supports,"" she said.

People suffering solely from a mental illness will be eligible for MAID as of March 17, 2024.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

AstraZeneca use for people under 55, vaccine committee recommends  CBC News","Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is recommending provinces pause the use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine on those under the age of 55 because of safety concerns — guidance most provinces said today that they would follow.

The change comes following reports out of Europe of very rare instances of blood clots in some immunized patients — notably among younger women.

But 300,000 of these shots have been administered in Canada already, with no reports of blood clots here, officials said. The blood clotting problem also has not been reported in people who have received mRNA vaccines like the Pfizer and Moderna products.

Speaking to reporters Monday, Dr. Shelley Deeks, the vice-chair of NACI, said that with ""substantial uncertainty"" around cases of vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) in people with low platelets, the committee is recommending the suspension of shots in all people under 55 as a ""precautionary measure.""

Based on early research out of Europe, VIPIT seems to be rare, occurring in anywhere from 1 in every 125,000 to 1 in 1 million people.

The European Union's drug watchdog, the European Medicines Agency, has said it could not definitively rule out a link between the vaccine and rare types of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia.

Specifically, it pointed to 18 cases of an extremely rare type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a condition that is much more common in women than men. Most of the cases occurred within 14 days of receiving the AstraZeneca shot, and the majority were in women under the age of 55.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said people who develop stroke-like medical symptoms after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine — shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, abdominal pain, sudden onset of headaches or blurred vision — should immediately seek medical attention. There is no risk for people who have not developed such symptoms 20 days post-vaccination.

Asked why the shot is still recommended for people over the age of 55 given the many unknowns, Dr. Caroline Quach-Thanh, the chair of NACI, said the early data indicate that the rare blood clots are most common in younger people.

She said older Canadians should take whatever vaccine they can get because contracting COVID-19 poses a much greater health risk to them than the outside chance of developing this sort of blood clot.

""If you look at this overall, it's a vaccine that prevents complications and deaths. We're trying to contrast the risks and benefits,"" she said.

WATCH: Vaccine committee recommends a pause on use of AstraZeneca vaccine among those under 55

Vaccine committee recommends a pause on use of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on those under the age of 55 Duration 1:35 Dr. Supriya Sharma, Health Canada's chief medical adviser, discusses NACI's recommendation to pause the use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine on those under the age of 55.

Quach-Thanh conceded the barrage of bad headlines about AstraZeneca could increase vaccine hesitancy but said that with the pandemic running ""rampant,"" seniors should get a shot that greatly reduces their risk of COVID-19-related death and hospitalization.

""This vaccine has had all the ups and downs — its looks like a roller coaster,"" she said, citing the changing guidelines on AstraZeneca.

Asked if he still has confidence in the safety of this product, Marc Berthiaume, the director of the bureau of medical science at Health Canada, said reports of rare, adverse health events are always possible when millions of people are treated with a vaccine.

""This vaccine remains relevant,"" he said.

""This is something that is very rare and we need to continue to monitor it,"" said Dr. Supriya Sharma, Health Canada's chief medical adviser, adding this is a sign that Canada has a robust monitoring system.

""It's reasonable to pause for a period of time while this continues to be evaluated,"" she said. ""I fully understand this can be confusing.""

... the benefits of using our vaccine to protect people from this deadly virus significantly outweigh the risks across all adult age groups. - AstraZeneca Canada

The policy shift comes as Canada is expected to receive 1.5 million doses of this product from the U.S. on Tuesday. The product has not yet been approved for use in the American marketplace.

The AstraZeneca shot has not been widely used in people under the age of 55 in this country.

Some jurisdictions, such as B.C. and P.E.I., have been using some of their supply to immunize young people who work in public-facing sectors like grocery and convenience stores. In New Brunswick, the shot was made available to first responders and some teachers last week.

Meanwhile, Health Canada — which approved the vaccine for use in Canada in February — said its regulators would be adding ""additional terms and conditions on the authorizations"" for AstraZeneca and a biologically identical version of the drug manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, which has been branded Covishield.

The manufacturers will be required to conduct a ""detailed assessment of the benefits and risks of the vaccine by age and sex in the Canadian context,"" information that could lead to ""additional regulatory actions.""

""This information will support the ongoing evaluation of these rare blood clotting events, and allow Health Canada to determine if there are specific groups of people who may be at higher risk,"" the department said in a press release.

Benefits outweigh risks: AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca issued a statement this evening saying that it respects the decision by NACI and noting that Health Canada's guidance on the vaccine has not changed since last week.

""Regulatory authorities in the U.K., European Union, the World Health Organization and Health Canada have concluded that the benefits of using our vaccine to protect people from this deadly virus significantly outweigh the risks across all adult age groups,"" said AstraZeneca spokesperson Carlo Mastrangelo in the statement.

The statement went on to say that tens of millions of people around the world have now taken the AstraZeneca vaccine and ""real-world evidence demonstrates its effectiveness.""

""Patient safety remains the company's highest priority. We continue to work closely with Health Canada to share and submit safety data as it becomes available to ensure the appropriate use of our vaccine,"" Mastrangelo said.

'We just won't use it, simple as that': Ford

Speaking to reporters in Niagara Falls, Ont., Ontario Premier Doug Ford said today that the province would follow NACI's guidance and reserve the current supply of AstraZeneca for those in the older cohort.

""I won't hesitate to cancel that in half a heartbeat. If it's going to put anyone in harm, we just won't use it, simple as that,"" he said, adding he didn't want to ""roll the dice"" by using AstraZeneca on a group that may have an outsized chance of developing complications.

""The guidance from the federal government is that it is safe for people over 55,"" Ford said. ""I'm talking about younger people taking it, 35 years of age and in that range, that's where the problem is.""

Dr. Joss Reimer, the medical lead on Manitoba's vaccine implementation task force, said that the province also would pause its deployment of the vaccine among people under 55 because of a ""very rare subtype, one specific type of blood clot.""

She said that while there have been no complications reported in Canada, ""out of an abundance of caution"" Manitoba will restrict the shot to people 55 to 64, for now.

""This is a pause while we wait for more information to better understand what's happened in Europe. This is an important and evidence-based change,"" she said.

Watch: Vaccine committee chair addresses AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy:

Vaccine committee chair addresses AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy Duration 1:28 Dr. Caroline Quach-Thanh, chair of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, responds to questions about Canadians being hesitant to receive the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.

Reimer said it's ""probably"" fine to use the vaccine on all groups — but she's not comfortable with just ""probably"" and wants to wait to see more data from Europe.

This is just the latest issue the company has faced over the last three months.

Earlier this year, a number of European countries halted vaccinations in response to questions about the AstraZeneca product's efficacy in people over the age of 65, only to restart them after new evidence emerged.

After Health Canada approved the shot for all adults, NACI recommended the product be used only on people under the age of 65, citing a dearth of clinical trial data on the vaccine's effectiveness in older people.

NACI changed course earlier this month after reviewing three ""real-world studies,"" saying the two-dose viral vector vaccine can and should be used on seniors.

Last week, the U.S. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which keeps an eye on clinical trials, found ""outdated information"" may have been reported by the company when it released data on U.S. trials.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, U.S. President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser and the head of the NIAID, said the monitoring board was surprised by the the better-than-expected efficacy results published by AstraZeneca.

the music business is putting a green spin on vinyl records  CBC News,"Vinyl records were once written off as relics. First, they were replaced by shiny compact discs that (supposedly) offered superior sound. Then streaming took over, allowing fans to carry vast music collections with them wherever they go.

In recent years, vinyl sales have turned around. In 2022, vinyl outsold CDs in the U.S. for the first time since 1987, with over 41 million records sold. More and more musical acts — including the unchallenged ruler of the pop music world, Taylor Swift — are releasing LP's. Swift set the standard by putting out multiple pressings of her albums in different colours, leaving Swifties scrambling to collect them all.

For those of a certain age, the record revival stirs feelings of nostalgia as a new generation tunes in to the warm, clear sound of vinyl. But this is the 21st century, the age of climate change — and vinyl's new fans want to know what all those records are doing to the environment.

""The industry has been going through more and more reflection in recent years as the vinyl boom has accelerated,"" said Paul Miller, vice president of sales at Precision Record Pressing in Burlington, Ont.

""On the one hand, it's something that plants are really beginning to contend with and, on the other hand, we're seeing more requests from artists asking what our sustainability efforts are.""

WATCH | A Canadian company is turning vinyl green: How one company is putting a green spin on vinyl records Duration 2:18 Vinyl records are making a big comeback as stars help to drive sales, but vinyl production does have an environmental impact. A Canadian company is reusing its scrap vinyl to try and reduce its carbon emissions.

Records are made from polyvinyl chloride, commonly known as PVC. It's a petroleum product derived from a complex chemical process. A vinyl record that winds up in a landfill lasts more or less forever. So the focus at Precision, Miller said, is on minimizing waste.

""The most impactful thing is to send as little to landfill as possible,"" he said.

To help reduce waste, Precision offers what it calls its Eco Mix. Misprinted or rejected albums that come off its presses are ground up, along with vinyl shavings left over from the manufacturing process, and then used to make new records.

New sounds from old scrap

Record plants have always tried to re-use this scrap material but Miller said his plant has taken it a step further. It's been sorting its leftover vinyl by colour so it can offer artists who want to use recycled material a choice of six distinctive shades; red, blue, green, yellow/orange, purple/pink and grey.

""The industry has had a recycled vinyl product for some time, typically called 'random colour,'"" Miller said. ""What that is is a grab bag of re-ground colours thrown together into a surprise colour.

""Sometimes it looks okay. Sometimes it has a bit of a baby vomit look. So it does the trick as far as being a sustainable product, but it's not that beautiful.""

Eco Mix is priced the same as single-colour vinyl and boasts identical sound quality, Miller said, making it an attractive choice for artists looking to make an environmental statement.

Pop star Billie Eilish is releasing a special version of her debut album using the recycled material. Smaller bands and labels are also taking notice.

""Cost is good but being a little eco-friendly is something that I find important,"" said Josh Wickins, who runs Wormwood Records in Ajax, Ont.

Wickins runs his label out the basement of a Caribbean roti restaurant — a room filled with amplifiers and musical gear, its walls covered in posters advertising gigs for some of the many bands that use the space to jam and rehearse.

""It is the definition of a pure punk basement,"" Wickins said. ""Just a pure punk spot.""

Wormwood's latest release is by the Toronto hardcore band Street Justice. The band members are dedicated vegans who embrace a straight-edge lifestyle — no booze or drugs. Their songs are short, loud and raw, with a firm focus on social issues like animal rights. Their new album is pressed from Eco Mix vinyl in shocking pink.

""For this record, I think it really tied with the ethos of the band. Their values, their ideals,"" said Wickins.

How much real environmental benefit comes from any of this is debatable. And there is a movement afoot in some parts of the music industry to move beyond vinyl altogether.

In the Netherlands, a group of eight companies calling themselves Green Vinyl is looking to streamline the record pressing process to make it more energy efficient. It also wants to replace the vinyl currently used to make LPs with more environmentally friendly material. A British firm, Evolution Music, has been pressing records on plant-based bioplastic which it says is non-toxic and compostable.

WATCH | Vinyl records with a smaller environmental footprint: Vinyl records with a green spin Duration 2:18 As vinyl sales surge, record manufacturers are looking for new ways to reduce the environmental footprint of LPs. CBC's Tom Parry takes a look inside one record pressing company in Burlington, Ont., putting a green — and red, blue, yellow/orange, purple/pink and grey — spin on vinyl records.

""I think a change is coming. It's inevitable,"" said Kyle Devine, a Canadian who teaches musicology at the University of Oslo in Norway.

Devine, who has visited the Green Vinyl plant and sits on the advisory board of Evolution Music calls PVC a ""particularly nasty plastic.""

""Records are fossil fuel products,"" he said. ""They're polluting to make. They're polluting to get rid of.""

Devine insisted he doesn't hate vinyl; he even has a small record collection of his own. He just thinks a better way of making records is now within reach.

The audible flaw in vinyl substitutes

He acknowledged vinyl alternatives have so far been met with skepticism by music fans, who say the sound just isn't as good. But he said he expects that to change and believes some listeners would be willing to sacrifice sound quality if it means going green.

""People who are buying new records are significantly younger people. And it's known that younger people do care a lot about climate issues,"" he said. ""And so I could imagine younger buyers purchasing greener records almost regardless of what they sounded like.""

In the grand scheme of things, Devine said, records aren't a huge environmental problem. And every music format — even streaming — has a carbon footprint. But he said that shouldn't stop music fans or the music industry from trying to do better.

Miller said his company is open to the idea of vinyl alternatives but isn't sold just yet.

""At the moment, I feel like there's more work to be done on that. I think record fans can accept some degree of trade-off when it comes to a more sustainable product that has a slightly higher surface noise,"" he said.

""But it seems to me it's not quite there yet and that the surface noise is too high. So what's the point of making a vinyl record that's not going to sound great?""

For now, Miller said, his plant will concentrate on reducing waste and reusing as much material as possible — fuelling the vinyl revival in a sustainable way.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

says  CBC News","A new report from the auditor general of Canada released Thursday warns that while progress has been made, the federal government must improve its management of immigration programs to reduce permanent residency backlogs.

Auditor General Karen Hogan's report also said the federal government doesn't know whether it is making progress on reducing barriers and inequities for minorities, and must speed up efforts to modernize the delivery of employment insurance, Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan to avoid a major outage.

""These issues are not new,"" Hogan said in Ottawa Thursday. ""If COVID-19 taught us anything, it is that being prepared and acting early costs less and results in better outcomes.""

Hogan's office audited eight permanent residency programs and found that, despite efforts to reduce pandemic backlogs, most people applying for permanent residency are still waiting a long time for their applications to be processed.

The eight programs examined by Hogan's office fall into three classes: refugee and humanitarian, economic, and family. While processing times improved for the economic and family classes, they worsened for refugees.

""At the end of 2022, about 99,000 refugees were still waiting for a decision on their application, and in the current processing environment, many will be waiting years,"" Hogan said in a media statement.

The report says that most privately sponsored refugees waited about 30 months for a decision on their application. Only five per cent of refugees in this class had their applications processed within Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada's (IRCC) 12-month timeline.

Most people applying under the Government-Assisted Refugee Program waited 26 months. Only 26 per cent of refugees in this stream saw their applications processed in 12 months.

Immigration Minister Marc Miller welcomed the report and said he would address the issues it raised. He said that Hogan's report revealed ""a lot of challenges.""

""I expect excellence from my department and this is not an excellent report,"" Miller said. ""While I am glad that the auditor general did trace a portrait of progress in a number of the areas, in one of the more vulnerable areas I am very concerned that the processing time are still lagging.""

Delayed processing times

Hogan's report said the backlogs remain high for a number of reasons, including the department's decision to process newer applications ahead of older ones already in the queue.

Hogan said that short-term government priorities, such as coping with the Syrian refugee crisis, led to newer applications being prioritized over those already in the system.

The audit also found that IRCC assigned workloads to offices without first determining if they had the resources to do the work.

While the IRCC introduced digital portals to speed up application processing times for family economic and class programs, it did not do so for the refugee program. The portals remain unavailable to most people applying for refugee programs, forcing them to submit their applications through email.

Watch: Government shouldn't need a crisis to act promptly, AG says:

Government shouldn't need a crisis to act promptly, AG says Duration 0:41 Karen Hogan, auditor general of Canada, says that if the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it's 'that being prepared and acting early costs less, and results in better outcomes.'

Hogan said that IRCC needs to understand why it has backlogs, ensure the tools it uses are working to reduce them and distribute resources properly to meet demand.

""I acknowledge that there are things outside the department's control when it comes to certain conditions in a country or access to critical documents, but what we found was that most of the delays were really being caused by inefficient management practices around applications and managing the inventory,"" Hogan said.

""It's real that there's a backlog of inventory that at times is greater than the immigration level for a given year, but the department has the ability to improve how they process applications [and] also to be more transparent with applicants about what their wait time might actually be.""

Delivering EI, CPP and OAS

The report also found that the information technology systems used to support the delivery of employment insurance, Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan are ""decades-old and at risk of failing.""

The report said the Liberal government's plan to modernize the delivery of these benefits has been delayed, putting the delivery of these benefits at risk.

The delivery system for OAS was supposed to be implemented this year, but that has been pushed to 2024 and could be pushed to 2025, the report said.

These delays increase the risk of a ""major outage that could disrupt the delivery of benefit payments,"" the report said.

""While Employment and Social Development Canada's decision to focus first on migrating the systems rightly prioritizes the continuity of benefits, I am concerned that if challenges and delays continue, decisions could be made to remove aspects of transformation or take shortcuts to maintain the timelines or budget, as happened with the Phoenix pay system,"" said Ms. Hogan.

The auditor general's report also looked at how successful federal government has been in reducing barriers and inequities in the workplace for racialized employees, and concluded that none of the existing barriers were fully removed.

The report audited six agencies and departments responsible for safety, justice and policing, including the Canada Border Services Agency, the Correctional Service of Canada, the Department of Justice, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Public Safety Canada and the RCMP.

It found that while a number of initiatives have been introduced to reduce barriers, they weren't tracked or measured to determine how well they're working.

""As a result, the six organizations did not know whether their actions had made or would make a difference in the work lives of racialized employees,"" the report said.

Dominic LeBlanc, the minister of democratic institutions, said Thursday that Canada is a diverse country and its public service should reflect that.

""The auditor general's report points out that there is more work to be done, particularly with the use of data to track our progress. We agree and accept that assessment,"" he said. ""Over the coming months, our government will work to address and implement those recommendations.""

Government IT systems and antimicrobial resistance

The IT systems for EI, CPP and OAS were not the only outdated technology platforms threatening service delivery that Hogan identified in her audit.

Her report said only 38 per cent of the federal government's roughly 7,500 information technology systems were considered to be ""healthy.""

About one third of nearly 1,500 applications critical to the health, safety, security and economic well-being of Canadians were found to be in ""poor health,"" the report said.

Hogan's audit also said that because departments and agencies have not been providing the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat with sufficient information about the health of their IT systems, the situation could be much worse.

""It has been more than 24 years since the government first identified aging systems as a significant issue, and the TBS still does not have a strategy to drive modernization,"" the report said.

""Aging systems are currently being maintained on old and outdated infrastructure, which is costly, resource intensive, and unsustainable.""

Anita Anand, the president of the Treasury Board, told reporters Thursday that updating government IT systems is complicated and requires oversight but her department is pushing forward as fast as it can.

""We thank the auditor general for her review and recommendations,"" she said. ""We know that we have more work to do on system modernization and we committed to delivering high-quality services to Canadians as we undergo this transformation.""

The report also found that the federal government isn't doing enough to address a growing resistance to antibiotics threatening the health of Canadians.

The audit said this is significant because in 2018, about a quarter of infections in Canada did not respond to ""first-line antimicrobials,"" leading to 5,400 deaths. By 2050, that is likely to increase to 40 per cent and almost 14,000 deaths, the report said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

may be on his way out — but Trumpism marches on  CBC News,"One very important thing — maybe the most important thing — changed in American politics this week. But several other important things seem to have stayed the same.

So Justin Trudeau and millions of other Canadians can now look forward to relaxing a bit come January 20, when Joe Biden is expected to be inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States — notwithstanding the recent fuss and fury from the 45th president and whatever else the incumbent might try to do to protest this result over the next two months.

But neither Trudeau, nor anyone who aspires to be prime minister at some point in the foreseeable future, can allow themselves to believe that the last four years were just a strange aberration.

The implicit promise of Biden's candidacy was a return to normalcy — or at least to the way things were before Donald Trump descended the escalator at Trump Tower in New York and launched his candidacy for president with a speech that promised to build a wall along the American border with Mexico to keep ""drugs,"" ""crime"" and ""rapists"" from entering the United States.

WATCH | Biden supporters celebrate in Pennsylvania:

Biden supporters celebrate in Philadelphia's streets moments after presidential victory Duration 10:46 Moments after major TV networks determined Joe Biden had enough electoral college votes to secure the U.S. presidency, his supporters in Philadelphia celebrated in the streets and described what his win means to them following a tight race.

After four years of panic, a little peace

As far as Canada is concerned, Biden should be able to fulfil that promise. For at least the next four years, there should be no reason to worry about what the American president might tweet. There should be no reason to think he might try to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement on a whim or launch a trade war premised on the idea that Canadian-made aluminum presents a national security threat to the United States.

It's unlikely that Biden will throw a public tantrum if Trudeau publicly disagrees with him at an international summit — or that one of Biden's senior advisers will condemn Trudeau to hell for doing so. It's hard to imagine Biden would call Trudeau and rant about how much he dislikes Chrystia Freeland and refer to her as a ""nasty woman"" — as Trump did during a phone call in June 2018 .

""It is as difficult a moment as we have ever faced as a country,"" Bob Rae, now Canada's ambassador to the United Nations, wrote that same month , at the height of this country's battle with the Trump administration over a new trade deal.

It's also possible that Canada will be able to count on a better response to the COVID-19 pandemic, at least after January 20 — and the United States getting itself in order would surely help Canada's recovery.

What Trumpism did for Trudeau

There are any number of things that Donald Trump might still try to do between now and January 20. But Trudeau can take comfort from the fact that he and Canada seem to have gotten through these last four years with modest injuries. The time and energy the Trudeau government previously spent thinking about Donald Trump can now be put towards literally anything else.

It might also be argued that the Trump years gave new purpose and relevance to the political project Trudeau started when he ran for leadership of the Liberal party in 2012. The election of a populist nationalist who campaigned on xenophobia, provoked racial division and denied the science of climate change put into stark relief a Liberal agenda that promised to pursue economic inclusion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, diversity and pluralism.

Trudeau might have benefited politically from that contrast. But historians also might judge him now on how well he navigated what feels like a pivot point for the future of liberal democracy.

Trudeau will now (and once again) have an American president whose stated worldview is broadly similar to his own. They will not agree on everything. The Keystone XL pipeline might die again. Softwood lumber seems destined to be a bilateral issue forever. But Canada should have a more helpful ally with whom he can readily cooperate.

Biden is likely to restore many of the environmental regulations that the Trump administration rolled back and rejoin the Paris accord on climate change. The United States presumably will now recommit to the world's other multilateral institutions — or at least stop trying to tear them down. Biden might still promote ""Buy American"" policies, but he's unlikely to target this country in a trade war.

WATCH | What Canada can expect from a Biden presidency:

What a Biden presidency could mean for Canada Duration 6:42 If Joe Biden wins the U.S. presidential election, Canadians could feel the impact in areas like energy, trade and defence.

A nation at odds with itself

But the verdict that American voters have delivered is not a wholesale repudiation of the last four years.

Biden's advantage in the popular vote likely will surpass that of Hilary Clinton in 2016. He will have flipped at least a few states that voted for Trump four years ago. When all the ballots are counted, Biden's victory probably will look not insignificant — on par perhaps with Barack Obama's win over Mitt Romney in 2012. And Biden now becomes one of the few candidates in recent American history to defeat a one-term incumbent.

But this was not a landslide. Biden's margin of victory is unlikely to match Obama's breakthrough in 2008 and it will fall well short of historic blowouts like Ronald Reagan's triumph over Walter Mondale in 1984 or Lyndon Johnson's defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964 . Control of the Senate remains up in the air, though the final standings will depend on run-off elections in Georgia .

After everything that has happened over the last four years, that might seem astounding. But this election result confirms that the United States is not the country it was in 1964 or 1984. It is profoundly polarized — so much so that not even the deaths of more than 225,000 Americans in a public health emergency could crush the incumbent's support.

A Republican-controlled Senate would make it much harder for Biden to implement his campaign commitments and might completely forestall any meaningful political reform. But the larger result is evidence that the forces that created a Trump presidency will not go away easily.

And now, because the result is close enough, Trump and his campaign are doing everything they can to cast doubt on the process — an effort that could do untold damage to America's institutions and social fabric.

The next four years might be quieter — at least for Canadians.

But there will be another presidential election four years from now. Canadians can't assume that someone like Donald Trump won't become president again, with everything that entails for continental trade, the global order and American democracy.

political brawl over 'woke' is about everything and nothing  CBC News,"Addressing the Liberal Party convention in Ottawa last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked some of the criticism his government has gotten lately from the Conservative opposition.

""They either say investing in Canadians is a waste of money or that our policies are too woke,"" he said. ""Too woke?""

He continued, directing his gaze at the TV camera perched on a riser in the middle of the room: ""Hey, Pierre Poilievre. It's time for you to wake up.""

The crowd in the convention hall cheered as Trudeau listed a series of policies that were, in his telling, merely good and sensible.

Those Liberals may have been pleased to hear their leader pushing back against this line of attack. And Trudeau might be happy to have this fight.

But grappling with the pejorative use of the word ""woke"" at this point could be like trying to box a shadow. Because whatever it originally meant, woke has become a way to say something without saying anything.

According to new survey data from Pollara, 57 per cent of Canadians claim to have at least a general idea of what woke means. But less than 27 per cent of all Canadians say they could explain the term to someone else (Pollara deliberately did not offer a definition to survey respondents when it conducted the poll). And it stands to reason that, even in that group, there are different definitions in use.

(Dan Arnold, Pollara's chief strategy officer, was director of research for the Trudeau government from 2015 to 2021.)

The term originated among Black Americans decades ago and came to mean being socially and politically conscious of injustices. It has gradually slipped into the mainstream over the last 20 years, carried along in part by the Black Lives Matter protests that originated in the United States.

At present, the Merriam-Webster dictionary describes woke as an adjective that means ""aware of and actively attentive to important societal facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).""

But the word also became part of America's culture wars in recent years, its meaning turned around to mock those seen as excessively or performatively committed to advocating for equality or other social causes.

Eventually, that backlash spread north. Former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole used the term during a video call with young Conservatives in 2020 when discussing a plan to rename the former Ryerson University because of its namesake's association with residential schools.

Since succeeding O'Toole as leader, Poilievre has embraced the word even more enthusiastically, while stretching its meaning even further.

The many, many things that are 'woke'

In an email to supporters last June, Poilievre said the Liberal government's ""obsession with woke culture"" had made university campuses inhospitable to those with differing viewpoints.

Subsequent messages from Poilievre and his party have used ""woke"" in the context of Bill C-11, legislation that will apply Canadian content regulations to major Internet platforms (Conservatives say it will be used to ""censor"" Canadians). Other Conservative messages have broadly invoked the Trudeau government's supposedly ""radical woke agenda.""

In the House of Commons, Poilievre has used the word to describe the CRTC, mayors whose housing policies he opposes, and a culture that allegedly is driving people away from military service. On Thursday, Poilievre said Trudeau's woke ""ideology"" explained the government's changes to the passport.

More common sense, less woke nonsense. <br><br>Let’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/BringItHome?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#BringItHome</a> <a href=""https://t.co/Rrm1hzcjCS"">pic.twitter.com/Rrm1hzcjCS</a> —@PierrePoilievre

In his remarks at the Liberal convention, Trudeau mentioned a few examples of policies and actions that he seemed to think Poilievre might find too woke: a gender-balanced cabinet, reducing poverty, expanding access to affordable child care.

""Let me tell you something — $10-a-day child care is not woke policy. It's economic policy,"" he said.

But Poilievre didn't mention any of those things in a video he posted to Twitter the next morning. Instead, after referring to Trudeau's ""woke ways,"" the Conservative leader listed a series of concerns: the Liberal government's latest gun control measures and the decriminalization of simple drug possession in British Columbia, pricing carbon emissions and the prime minister going on vacation, an increase in spending on the public service and the recent public service strike.

It's possible Poilievre was trying to suggest these examples somehow showed hypocrisy on Trudeau's part. But it's fair to say the legendary blues singer Lead Belly probably didn't have any of those things in mind when he told Black Americans to ""stay woke"" in 1938.

In Poilievre's interpretation, woke serves as little more than a catch-all term for whatever conservative politicians and commentators happen to oppose at the moment — much the way ""socialism"" used to be wielded as a weapon against progressive proposals.

How Canadians feel about woke (and other words)

But even if his own definition isn't clear — and even if most people couldn't tell you what woke means — Poilievre might still be speaking to a receptive audience.

According to Pollara, 31 per cent of Canadians who have at least heard the word think woke is ""usually"" a ""bad thing,"" while 16 per cent think it's usually a ""good thing.""

Among Conservative voters, the split is even more stark — just five per cent say woke is good, while 57 per cent say it's bad. Bloc Quebecois voters feel similarly, with seven per cent saying good and 50 per cent saying bad.

Liberal and NDP voters are much more inclined to view ""woke"" as a good thing — 31 per cent of Liberal supporters and 36 per cent of NDP voters like the word. But even those parties must contend with voters who think there's something ""bad"" about being woke — 14 per cent among Liberals, 13 per cent among New Democrats.

The woke wants to delete Mother’s Day.<br><br>This ugly and weird ideology—which Trudeau endorsed at his party convention—wants to delete everything except the state which would control everything and everyone.<a href=""https://t.co/cW1Ts50eqm"">https://t.co/cW1Ts50eqm</a> —@PierrePoilievre

Nationally, just 25 per cent of Canadians consider themselves woke, including only 14 per cent of Quebecers — which might explain why Trudeau decided to defend himself against Poilievre's attacks last week.

But while many Canadians understand woke to be a bad thing, they maintain a positive view of other words associated with social justice causes. According to Pollara, ""Black Lives Matter"" had a net good/bad rating of plus-35, while pride flags were plus-34. Feminism, #MeToo, allyship and affirmative action were plus-30, plus-28, plus-26 and plus-21, respectively.

Canadians seem to suspect that there's something different about being woke even as they broadly support the sorts of causes that, once upon a time, would have been associated with wokeness.

How Poilievre defines woke

During debate on C-11 in late March, Liberal MP Jenica Atwin asked Poilievre how he would define ""woke.""

""Woke has one purpose and only one purpose. It has plenty of pretexts but only one purpose: control,"" Poilievre responded. ""It is designed to divide people by race, gender, ethnicity, religion, vaccine status and any other way one can divide people into groups. Why? It is because then one can justify having a government to control all those groups.""

Poilievre's references to race and gender might seem to point back to woke's official definition and the backlash to it. But other than the apparent reference to vaccine mandates, Poilievre didn't link his definition to any specific federal policies.

And it's not obvious how this definition would line up with the examples that the Conservative leader cited in his video response to Trudeau's speech. (Poilievre's office did not respond to an email seeking further explanation.)

Many federal policies take into account race, gender or ethnicity. The Liberal government has promised to address systemic discrimination in the justice system. Statistics Canada has been provided with funding to improve its gathering of disaggregated data on race, gender and sexual orientation. A dedicated fund has been created to support Black entrepreneurs. Trudeau's office has also prioritized diversity in federal appointments. Federal budgets are now subject to gender-based analysis.

Are any of those policies too woke? What exactly is woke about the Trudeau government and how precisely would a Poilievre government be different?

In the absence of actual specifics, the word isn't much more than a schoolyard taunt. And if there is a fight to be had here, the first step would seem to be getting those who use the word to explain exactly what they think it means.

Pollara conducted an online survey of 2,000 Canadians between April 17 and April 28. For comparison purposes only, a probabilistic sample of the same size would yield a margin of error of +/- 2.2%, 19 times out of 20.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

real estate company collected 5 million images of shoppers, say privacy watchdogs  CBC News","The real estate company behind some of Canada's most popular shopping centres embedded cameras inside its digital information kiosks at 12 shopping malls in major Canadian cities to collect millions of images — and used facial recognition technology without customers' knowledge or consent — according to a new investigation by the federal, Alberta and B.C. privacy commissioners.

""Shoppers had no reason to expect their image was being collected by an inconspicuous camera, or that it would be used, with facial recognition technology, for analysis,"" said federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien in a statement.

""The lack of meaningful consent was particularly concerning given the sensitivity of biometric data, which is a unique and permanent characteristic of our body and a key to our identity.""

According to the report, the technology Cadillac Fairview used — known as ""anonymous video analytics"" or AVA— took temporary digital images of the faces of individuals within the field of view of the camera in the directory.

WATCH: Shoppers' privacy violated at major Canadian malls: Privacy commissioners:

Shoppers’ privacy violated at major Canadian malls: Privacy commissioners Duration 2:01 Cadillac Fairview, the real estate company behind some of Canada’s biggest malls, violated the privacy of shoppers by collecting five million images without consent from cameras inside digital information kiosks, an investigation by federal, British Columbia and Alberta privacy commissioners found.

It then used facial recognition software to convert those images into biometric numerical representations of individual faces, about five million images in total.

That sensitive personal information could be used to identify individuals based on their unique facial features, said the commissioners.

The report said the company also kept about 16 hours of video recordings, including some audio, which it had captured during a testing phase at two malls.

Cadillac Fairview said it used AVA technology to assess foot traffic and track shoppers' ages and genders — but not to identify individuals.

The company also argued shoppers were made aware of the activity through decals it placed on shopping mall entry doors that warned cameras were being used for ""safety and security"" and included the web address for Cadillac Fairview's privacy policy.

But the commissioners said that wasn't good enough and did not meet the standard for meaningful consent.

""An individual would not, while using a mall directory, reasonably expect their image to be captured and used to create a biometric representation of their face, which is sensitive personal information, or for that biometric information to be used to guess their approximate age and gender,"" they wrote.

The privacy watchdogs also took issue with the way the five million images were stored.

Cadillac Fairview said the images taken by camera were briefly analyzed then deleted — but investigators found that the sensitive biometric information generated from the images was being stored in a centralized database by a third-party company,

""Our investigation revealed that [Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited's] AVA service provider had collected and stored approximately five million numerical representations of faces on CFCL's behalf, on a decommissioned server, for no apparent purpose and with no justification,"" notes the investigation.

""Cadillac Fairview stated that it was unaware that the database of biometric information existed, which compounded the risk of potential use by unauthorized parties or, in the case of a data breach, by malicious actors.""

Company says technology couldn't identify people

The company said the technology was used to detect the presence of a human face and assign it ""within milliseconds"" to an approximate age and gender category and maintains it did not store any images during the pilot program and was not capable of recognizing anyone.

The decal found on the entrance doors of the CF Toronto Eaton Centre (Office of the Privacy Commissioner report)

""The five million representations referenced in the [Office of the Privacy Commissioner] report are not faces. These are sequences of numbers the software uses to anonymously categorize the age range and gender of shoppers in the camera's view,"" Cadillac Fairview spokesperson Jess Savage said in a statement to CBC News.

""The OPC report concludes there is no evidence that CF was using any technology for the purpose of identifying individuals.""

CF suspended its use of cameras back in 2018 when provincial and federal privacy commissioners launched their probe following a CBC investigation.

In a statement to CBC News on Thursday, the company said it has deleted the data.

""We subsequently deactivated directory cameras and the numerical representations and associated data have since been deleted,"" said Savage.

""We take the concerns of our visitors seriously and wanted to ensure they were acknowledged and addressed.""

However, the three commissioners said they have concerns about the company's plans going forward.

""The commissioners remain concerned that Cadillac Fairview refused their request that it commit to ensuring express, meaningful consent is obtained from shoppers should it choose to redeploy the technology in the future,"" said the commissioners' statement.

No fines under Canadian law

Savage said Cadillac Fairview accepted and implemented all the recommendations ""with the exception of those that speculate about hypothetical future uses of similar technology.""

The investigation found the technology was used in five provinces at the following malls:

CF Market Mall (Calgary)

CF Chinook Centre (Calgary)

CF Richmond Centre (Richmond, B.C.)

CF Pacific Centre (Vancouver)

CF Polo Park (Winnipeg)

CF Toronto Eaton Centre (Toronto)

CF Sherway Gardens (Toronto)

CF Fairview Mall (Toronto)

CF Lime Ridge (Hamilton, Ont.)

CF Markville Mall (Markham, Ont.)

CF Galeries d'Anjou (Montreal)

CF Carrefour Laval (Laval, Que.)

Ann Cavoukian, executive director at the Global Privacy and Security by Design Centre, said a case like this would lead to millions of dollars in fines if it had happened in the United States.

""The commissioners are doing the best they can with the limited resources they have,"" she said.

""What we have to insist upon is that private sector entities like Cadillac Fairview step up and protect their customers' privacy. Otherwise, why are the customers going to continue shopping there?""

B.C. Information and Privacy Commissioner Michael McEvoy said the fact he and his counterparts can't issue a fine in a case like this should make the case for stronger powers at both the federal and provincial levels.

""Fines in a case like this would have been a consideration. It is an incredible shortcoming of Canadian law,"" he said.

""We as privacy regulators don't have any authority to levy fines on companies that violate peoples' personal information and that should really change.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

population surpasses 40 million  CBC News,"Canada's population has hit 40 million people. The historic pace of the increase is being driven by immigration and the need for workers, but it's also causing the already dire housing crisis to get even worse.

Canada's population has surpassed 40 million people, according to Statistics Canada.

The federal statistics agency's "" population clock "" uses modelling to estimate Canada's population in real time. The counter hit the 40 million mark just before 3 p.m. ET on Friday.

""This is an exciting milestone for Canada,"" said chief statistician Anil Arora in a media statement. ""It is a strong signal that Canada remains a dynamic and welcoming country, full of potential.""

Canada's population growth rate currently stands at 2.7 per cent. That's the highest annual growth rate since 1957, when Canada was in the middle of its post-war baby boom, says Statistics Canada.

Matti Siemiatycki, director of the Infrastructure Institute and a professor at the department of geography and planning at the University of Toronto, said the population milestone presents opportunities and challenges for Canada.

""This is a recognition that we're a country that's been growing for some time, that we are a country that continues to attract people and is an attractive place for newcomers,"" he said.

Population grew by over 1 million last year

Canada's population grew by a record 1.05 million last year and about 96 per cent of the rise was due to international migration, the agency said.

Siemiatycki said Canada needs to attract newcomers to fill jobs left vacant by retiring baby boomers.

""From an economic perspective, newcomers have been really important both to fill jobs that are here and to connect us with the economies out into the wider world,"" he said.

But a growing population also presents challenges, particularly with housing, Siemiatycki said.

The average price of a Canadian resale home has increased four months in a row this year, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. The average selling price of a home in April — the month for which the most recent data is available — was $716,000.

Siemiatycki said Canada urgently needs to build more housing to accommodate Canada's growing population.

""We are in a crunch. We haven't been building enough units across the country, especially at the affordable levels,"" he said.

But Siemiatycki said attracting more skilled labour can also bolster the workforce needed to build more housing.

Canada's population topped 30 million in 1997 and could reach 50 million as early as 2043 if current trends continue, Statistics Canada said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC News'}"

digs in as the West stumbles to keep up with Russian war production  CBC.ca,"""War,"" said British philosopher, mathematician and pacifist Bertrand Russell, ""does not determine who is right — only who is left.""

Those words might be the perfect lens through which to view what probably lies ahead for Ukraine in the coming year as its troops dig in — and dig deep — along a front roughly 960 kilometres wide.

Beyond that front stretches a wasteland of occupied territory — the smoldering ruins of a months-long summer counteroffensive that fell short of allies' hype and failed to dislodge the Russian Army from the 20 per cent of the country it occupies.

Behind it lies a war-weary population, growing domestic political anxiety and infighting, and international allies who have grown more capricious — even delinquent.

Whether it's aid roadblocks in the U.S. Congress, empty arsenal shelves in Canada or the political tantrums pitched by hostile leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orban, the war that captured the world's attention in 2022 has undeniably entered a dangerous new phase.

Dangerous — because solidarity among Ukraine's allies has started to fray, while the domestic political consensus in Ukraine itself shows signs of unravelling.

Ukraine's offensive has run out of road: expert

Ukraine's ability to conduct large-scale offensive operations ""has ended,"" said Matthew Schmidt, an Eastern Europe expert at the University of New Haven, Connecticut.

""I don't think it is believed amongst the political leadership yet,"" he said. ""It's not an accepted fact.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has tied his country's future — and his political future — to achieving the complete and total withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine, including Crimea, which Russia has occupied since 2014.

Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, penned a frank assessment of the battlefield conditions for the Economist last fall — one that contrasted with Zelenskyy's steadfast, optimistic public pronouncements.

Zaluzhnyi suggested the war was sliding toward a stalemate — a notion rejected by Zelenskyy even as the Ukrainian army began digging defensive positions along the line.

""Ukraine cannot continue to prosecute the war in the way that they have. It's that simple,"" said Schmidt, who estimated that without a new U.S. aid package, Ukraine's resources to prosecute the war could dry up as early as March.

Once it became clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he couldn't conquer all of Ukraine quickly, he switched to a strategy of grinding attrition, banking that the western solidarity which characterized the immediate post-invasion climate would crumble.

Putin seems to be counting on the attention deficit disorder that currently characterizes democracies in the West eating away at Ukraine's support, and may be hoping for the return of Ukraine-skeptic Donald Trump to the White House.

The far-right in the United States and Canada has characterized continued economic and military support for the government in Kyiv as a waste of money and resources — something Schmidt described as a lie of omission.

""They haven't told the full story,"" he said. ""And the lie by omission that they've been telling has created the false impression that this is an unjustified sum of money ... that no matter what the sum is, it's not helping American economic as well as security interest.""

Phillip Karber, president of the conservative-leaning U.S.-based Potomac Foundation and an expert in Russian war strategy and tactics, said every Ukrainian soldier holding the line represents one American or Canadian soldier who does not have to be deployed to Europe.

""The Russians have tried various ways to interdict Western munitions"" going into Ukraine, he said. Those efforts have not been ""successful,"" he added, ""but the U.S. Congress has done what the Russians couldn't.""

On December 19, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the U.S. Senate said Washington will not be able to approve new aid for Ukraine before the year's end, as the two sides continue to seek a compromise over border security — unquestionably a domestic political issue.

Zelenskyy flew to Washington in mid-December to lobby for the aid. The Ukrainian president said at his year-end news conference that he remains hopeful that the United States ""will not betray"" his besieged nation.

Will Ukraine have to seek a ceasefire?

But given the developments of the last six months, both Karber and Schmidt said it's become much more likely that Ukraine will have to seek some kind of ceasefire or negotiated settlement in the coming year.

It's not hard to see why. While Russia's combat losses — estimated now at over 315,000 dead and wounded — have gotten all of the attention, the war has also bled the Ukrainian military both figuratively and literally.

It's believed that Ukraine has suffered up to 250,000 military casualties, with many of the wounded facing debilitating injuries.

More troubling still is the fact that Ukraine's military now faces an uphill recruiting battle.

In his essay, Zaluzhnyi acknowledged that training and recruiting troops was becoming a serious challenge. As late as December 18, the general was complaining publicly about Zelenskky's decision last summer to fire all of Ukraine's regional military recruitment heads in a corruption crackdown.

""The prolonged nature of the war, limited opportunities for the rotation of soldiers on the line of contact, gaps in legislation that seem to legally evade mobilization, significantly reduce the motivation of citizens to serve with the military,"" Zaluzhnyi wrote in The Economist.

Karber said there are key battles to keep an eye on in the coming months, chief among them Avdiivka in the eastern Donetsk region.

Holding the line in Donetsk

The Russians have poured tens of thousands of troops into a major offensive to take the city in the well-known coal mining region. As of December 21, they had advanced to within two kilometres of the city at an estimated cost of nearly 20,000 casualties.

Holding that part of the line is crucial to Ukraine's war effort, Karber said.

""If the Ukrainians get pushed off of their current positions that are holding, these guys are hooped,"" he said.

""The way the terrain opens up into flat country, if the Russians push through and break out into that area, it is basically open all the way to the Dnipro River (in the west) and north.""

If the Russians try for a major breakthrough in the new year, Karber said, it likely will be in the late spring or early summer of 2024, when they've built up their depleted forces again.

In an intelligence assessment dated December 20, the U.K. Ministry of Defence noted that Ukraine had switched to a defensive posture along the line and had ""mobilized efforts to improve its fortifications."" The report said the likelihood of a Russian breakthrough at the time was minimal.

""The front is characterized by stasis,"" the assessment said.

Karber said the ""horrific level of Russian casualties"" is preventing major Russian gains.

(Roman Hrytsyna/Associated Press)

He said Ukraine is likely to use a combination of long-range missiles, drones and special forces to turn parts of Crimea and the Kerch Strait and Black Sea regions into scorched-earth zones, with the aim of preventing Russia from resupplying and rebuilding its forces.

""The best hope is for Ukraine to get more long range missiles, ATACMS, to strangle Russian logistics,"" Karber said.

In October, Ukraine revealed it had quietly received, and then successfully used, American Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) long-range weapons against Russia.

Ukraine has said it needs more ATACMS weapons and vast quantities of ammunition, especially NATO standard 155 millimetre artillery rounds.

Fair-weather allies?

It is here that political machinations in the U.S. Congress and allied dithering — such as Canada's glacial progress on boosting ammunition production — have the potential to kneecap Ukraine, Karber said.

""Wars are won and lost on the margin,"" he said, referring to an army's ability to resupply itself. ""And I hate to say it — [it's] embarrassing as an American, humiliating as an American — but we're the ones that hold that difference in that margin.""

Allies like the United States and Canada tripped over themselves to give the Ukrainians 155 millimetre howitzers and modern main battle tanks, claiming the superior technology and firepower would help drive the Russians out.

But supplies of ammunition and spares for that equipment are now caught up in the funding fight in Washington.

""So it's a double whammy because we've introduced these systems, they're really important for the Ukrainians,"" Karber said. And now, with dwindling stocks of ammunition, their use is being dramatically scaled back.

Last fall, a CBC News investigation showed that high prices, corporate rivalries and a shortage of spare parts hobbled allies' efforts to help Ukraine repair the Leopard 2 main battle tanks it received from several countries.

The German manufacturers of the 55-tonne tank were reluctant to share the intellectual property rights so that a world-wide shortage of spare parts could be alleviated.

Russia may have sustained heavy losses, but its ability to absorb them and reconstitute its forces worries the experts.

""The Russians' ability at the moment [to resupply and rebuild key equipment] is potentially outstripping what the West is able to help supply Ukraine,"" said Dave Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, an Ottawa-based think-tank that occasionally hosts events sponsored by defence contractors.

Canada slow to resupply

Addressing the House of Commons defence committee in mid-December, Perry said he was particularly alarmed by the slow pace at which Canada was ramping up production of artillery shells.

Canada produces 3,000 of the 155 millimetre artillery shells per month under a framework called the Munitions Supply Program. It's a standing arrangement with five private sector companies — the most prominent being General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems Canada (GDOT-C) — to maintain stocks and provide surge capacity in times of crisis.

The federal government has been negotiating with the companies to boost production.

""I think it seems to me like there's been a lack of urgency and focus on this issue,"" Perry testified

""Notwithstanding the technical expertise involved in this, in the grand scheme of things, artillery shells are not complicated compared to air defence systems, or many of the other pieces of equipment that Ukraine needs.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

are being released, committee hears  CBC.ca","More than 200 bank accounts worth nearly $8 million were frozen when the federal government used emergency powers to end a massive protest occupation of downtown Ottawa.

Federal officials report most of the accounts are now in the process of being released, a parliamentary committee heard Tuesday.

Isabelle Jacques, assistant deputy minister of finance, told a committee of MPs that up to 210 bank accounts holding about $7.8 million were frozen under the financial measures contained in the Emergencies Act.

""Information was shared by the RCMP with financial institutions and we were informed yesterday by financial institutions that they were unfreezing the accounts,"" she said.

""The vast majority of accounts are in the process of being unfrozen, subject to any new information that the RCMP may have.""

Jacques said that because accounts are being released now, the number of accounts affected and their total dollar value continues to decrease by the day.

She also said the fact that more than 200 bank accounts were frozen did not necessarily mean that more than 200 people lost access to their funds. Jacques said that individuals may have held more than one account affected by the measures.

Some Conservative MPs have said constituents have reported that their bank accounts were frozen after they made donations to the convoy protest through one of its crowdfunding campaigns.

In a statement released Monday, the RCMP said it only provided banks with the names of convoy organizers and the owners of trucks who had refused to leave the protest area. The RCMP said it did not release an exhaustive list of every donation made.

""At no time did we provide a list of donors to financial institutions,"" the statement said.

Small donors unlikely to be affected: official

Jacques said that the financial measures in the Emergencies Act came into force on Feb. 15 and were specifically designed to apply enough financial pressure to convince protest organizers and participants to go home.

""Based on the knowledge that I have, I think it would be unlikely that someone who gave … $20 three weeks ago, or even $20 post Feb. 15, that they would have been captured by a freeze,"" she said.

""It's not impossible in view of the order, but in view of the exchange of information and the focused approach that was taken to stop the illegal funding of these activities, it would appear to be unlikely that this occurred, but not impossible.""

She said the measures should not affect anyone who provided financial support to the convoy before Feb. 15. Jacques said that anyone who saw their account frozen and who subsequently left the blockade area should expect to see the account unfrozen in the coming days.

Since the Emergencies Act was invoked, the Liberal government has been asked to explain what specific powers the act provides that did not already exist under conventional Canadian law.

Jacques told MPs that before the Emergencies Act was invoked, FINTRAC — Canada's financial intelligence unit — could not police the movement of money through some crowdfunding websites and some payment service providers.

She also said that while the federal government does have the power to freeze bank accounts in certain limited circumstances without using the Emergencies Act — in cases of suspected terrorism or financial crimes, for example — it did not do so in this instance.

""There's no other venues to freeze the accounts in view of the … illegal blockades that were ongoing,"" she said.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

fentanyl is an international problem, RCMP says  CBC.ca","The head of the RCMP unit responsible for fighting organized crime says Canada is not just a significant producer of fentanyl — we also export it.

Organized crime groups in Canada are using precursor chemicals to produce the deadly drug for both the domestic market and for sales abroad, Mathieu Bertrand said in an interview with CBC's The House airing Saturday.

""Sadly, Canada is a producing country of fentanyl and synthetic opioids. Not only are we a producing country, we're an exporting country,"" Bertrand told host Catherine Cullen.

Bertrand, chief superintendent of Serious and Organized Crime & Border Integrity at RCMP Federal Policing, said that while Canada has a problem with fentanyl imports, domestic production is what alarms police most at the moment. The fact that gangs in Canada are exporting fentanyl means either that there's a glut on the market here or there are more lucrative markets abroad, he added.

The House 12:03 RCMP sheds light on Canada’s illicit drug trade In a rare interview, Mathieu Bertrand, RCMP chief superintendent of Serious and Organized Crime and Border Integrity, describes who is profiting off the toxic drug crisis in Canada — and why this country has become an exporter of fentanyl.

""Our collaborative efforts in law enforcement in Canada are to address the domestic production, because it is significant,"" he said.

The toxic drug crisis is killing an average of 21 people every day in Canada. Fentanyl is involved in the vast majority of those deaths. During a visit to Thunder Bay, Ont., earlier this year, The House spoke to residents about the prevalence of gangs in the city and the lucrative domestic market there.

Most of the 600-plus organized crime groups assessed by the RCMP's criminal intelligence branch are involved in the drug trade, Bertrand said.

""Twenty-one per cent of those groups are involved with substances that are responsible for the overdose crisis that we're faced with now,"" he added.

The federal government recently issued new regulations to classify certain chemicals needed to make fentanyl as formal precursors. The regulations allow law enforcement to take action against the illegal use, importation or distribution of those key ingredients. The U.S. and Canada also agreed earlier this year to strengthen a cross-border partnership on drug trafficking.

Bertrand said that collaboration is key to fighting back against the fentanyl trade.

RCMP says Canadian-made fentanyl is being sold overseas Duration 0:50 A high-ranking member of the RCMP says Canada has become both a producer and exporter of illegal fentanyl, and both domestic and international collaboration is needed to disrupt the supply chain of organized crime groups operating in this country. Mathieu Bertrand sits down with Catherine Cullen, host of CBC's The House, to discuss.

The role of China

Bertrand cited Australia and New Zealand as known destinations for Canada-made fentanyl.

Some Asian countries supply key ingredients for Canadian-made fentanyl via shipments through South American countries or the United States, he said.

A law enforcement roundtable in 2021 noted a tenfold increase in precursor chemicals seized by the Canada Border Services Agency, and said that most of the chemicals come from China and Hong Kong.

The U.S. announced in October it was imposing sanctions and laying charges against a number of Chinese individuals and companies they allege are responsible for illegal fentanyl distribution in the United States.

WATCH | American, Chinese leaders meet Biden, Xi meet face-to-face for 1st time in a year Duration 2:17 After a year of silence, U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke face-to-face for the first time ahead of this year's APEC Summit in San Francisco. Both leaders acknowledged the importance of the meeting and of continuing dialogue.

""We know that this global fentanyl supply chain, which ends with the deaths of Americans, often starts with chemical companies in China,"" said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.

During a recent meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the two agreed to once more cooperate on cracking down on fentanyl, following a multi-year suspension of those efforts.

China and Canada agreed to collaborate on combating fentanyl distribution back in 2016.

""As you know, the political situation between the two countries right now is somewhat strained. I think we can say it's complicated,"" Bertrand said.

He added there are RCMP liaison officers on the ground in China working on the issue, and previous regulations ""had a significant positive impact on the drug situation.""

But efforts to disrupt the fentanyl supply chain face challenges, he said.

""One of the challenges is that a lot of these precursors are not illegal,"" he said.

Bertrand said the fight against fentanyl production in Canada is only one aspect of efforts to reduce the number of overdose deaths.

""The opioid crisis is more than a law enforcement issue,"" he said.

""I think we have to turn our minds to the demand and what we can do to ensure that individuals are not seeking out these substances — [that] they appreciate and understand how dangerous, and I would say how deadly they are.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

health minister says he won't allow Florida to 'pillage' the drug supply  CBC.ca,"Health Minister Mark Holland says Florida's plan to import cheaper Canadian pharmaceuticals is a non-starter and the federal government will use its regulatory power to ensure the national drug supply does not face any shortages due to actions by a foreign state.

""There is no way we will allow any jurisdiction, be it a state or another foreign jurisdiction, to endanger the Canadian drug supply. That is not an appropriate solution to whatever challenges they may be facing,"" Holland said during an official announcement in Nova Scotia of a bilateral health-care deal with the province.

""We're going to do everything in our power to make sure that another country cannot be given the ability to pillage our health system for its own benefit.""

Holland said he will soon travel to Washington, D.C. to make it known to officials there that Canada will not stand idle if Florida or other U.S. states pursue bulk imports that threaten Canadians' access to medication in any way.

He said it's ""inappropriate"" for U.S. politicians to look to Canada to help fix their costly health-care system, where sky-high drug prices are the norm.

WATCH: Canada's drug supply is 'safe,' says health minister Canada's drug supply is 'safe,' says health minister Duration 0:41 Mark Holland says he will ensure that the country's supply of pharmaceuticals is not affected by Florida's plan to import cheaper Canadian drugs.

Holland's comments come after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week approved a Florida program to import certain prescription drugs from Canada at a lower cost.

Because of limits on prescription drug price negotiations in the U.S., politicians south of the border have argued their health-care systems should simply buy more drugs from Canada.

A 2021 report by the Rand Corporation found that Canadian prices were just 46 per cent of those in the United States because Ottawa limits how much drugmakers can charge for medicines. The U.S. lets the free market dictate drug prices.

Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also vying to be his party's candidate for the U.S. presidency, has long championed the initiative.

He celebrated the FDA's decision as an opportunity for Florida to ""import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs."" DeSantis said the program will save Floridian taxpayers $180 million in the first year it's operational.

The state has said it wants initially to import drugs that treat HIV, mental illness and prostate cancer.

WATCH: Fears of shortages after U.S. allows Florida to import Canadian drugs Fears of shortages after U.S. allows Florida to import Canadian drugs Duration 2:17 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given Florida the go-ahead to buy cheaper wholesale prescription drugs from Canada, which has reignited fears of drug shortages in this country.

While Florida has the green light from U.S. regulators, it's still not clear if the state will get its hands on a meaningful quantity of drugs from Canada.

Holland said Canada has a large pharmaceutical industry that makes a number of drugs for sale overseas, and those exports will continue.

But Canada is dealing with serious supply issues of its own.

A national database suggests dozens of medications are in short supply in Canada, including popular drugs like diazepam — sold under the brand name Valium and used to treat anxiety — and opioids like hydromorphone.

""Understandably, the U.S. has its challenges with its drug supply and its costs. We will not allow the U.S. at all to use Canada as a means of fixing that problem,"" Holland said. ""We will do everything in our power to ensure shortages do not occur.""

Holland said Canada won't hesitate to use regulatory powers first introduced in 2020 to restrict bulk exports that could worsen drug shortages.

Those regulations, enacted as then-U.S. president Donald Trump was touting a drugs-from-Canada scheme, bars the distribution of certain drugs outside of Canada that would cause or worsen a shortage.

Some provincial health ministers are urging Ottawa to take decisive action now to avoid any disruptive effects.

In an interview with CBC's Rosemary Barton Live, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said what Florida and other states are proposing is ""effectively a raid on Canada's drug supply.""

Allowing one of the most populous U.S. states to scoop up already limited Canadian supply would ""clearly cause a drug shortage,"" Dix said.

B.C. has been grappling with limited quantities of the type 2 diabetes treatment Ozempic, which is being widely used off-label for obesity.

To stop diversion to the U.S., the province introduced a regulation to halt online and mail-order sales of the drug to people who do not live in Canada or are not in B.C. to make a purchase in person.

WATCH: U.S. allows Florida to import drugs from Canada, reviving fears of shortages U.S. allows Florida to import drugs from Canada, reviving fears of shortages Duration 5:52 Rosemary Barton speaks with B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix about his province's response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowing states to import prescription drugs from Canada. In recent years, Canada has run short on a range of drugs, including the popular weight-loss and diabetes drug Ozempic.

But Dix said the Ozempic case is just one example, adding Florida's plan could result in a vast quantity of drugs being sent to the U.S. if Ottawa doesn't move aggressively to curtail exports.

""In the Ozempic case, we took action. This is at a different scale altogether. We're talking about the importation of billions of dollars under the Florida scheme that has been approved by the FDA — billions of dollars of drugs,"" he said.

""We need to take action when these things come.""

NDP MP Don Davies, the party's health critic, said drug shortages have ""long been a serious problem in Canada."" Citing past shortages of things like EpiPens and children's pain medication, he said Ottawa should establish a ""public manufacturer"" of critical medications and vaccines.

Davies also said Canada ""should not be allowing the export of medicines to the U.S. unless we have a stable supply for domestic use.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

convention pitch to fight online disinformation denounced as assault on free press  CBC.ca,"Without debate, Liberal Party members passed a policy resolution to combat online disinformation this weekend that critics warn could give the government control over Canadian media outlets.

The resolution calls for the Liberals to ""explore options to hold online information services accountable for the veracity of material published on their platforms, and to limit publication only to material whose sources can be traced.""

""It's deeply troubling this was sort of waved through at the Liberal convention,"" said University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist.

""It's a dangerous proposal,"" said Geist, the Canada research chair in Internet and e-commerce law. ""It's one that we would see, I think, in far more repressive regimes. It isn't appropriate in a country like Canada that has a commitment to freedom of expression, freedom of the press and a robust democracy.""

The resolution passed at the convention on Saturday morning, when there were only about two dozen people in the room. The policy resolution is among two dozen passed by grassroots party members.

Registered Liberals ranked it tenth out of 24 in order of priority.

The resolution is non-binding, which means the party can ignore it altogether.

CBC News asked the office of Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez what it would do. The party released a statement at 1 p.m. on Monday saying it ""has and always will respect the independence of the press."" The office said an independent press ""is fundamental to our democracy"" and called it ""the best defence against disinformation.""

Just before 5 p.m., Rodriguez's office sent a response that put more distance between the government and the controversial resolution.

""A Liberal government would never implement a policy that would limit freedom of the press or dictate how journalists would do their work,"" said Rodriguez's press secretary Laura Scaffidi in an email.

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriquez's office insists the federal government would never consider restrictions on freedom of the press. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

The office would not say whether that means the government will commit to never implementing the resolution.

Responding to criticism Monday, the author of the resolution, B.C. Liberal Catherine Evans, said the policy was never intended to ""target reputable Canadian journalists"" but rather to combat disinformation people post anonymously online.

""This is so ironic to have misunderstanding about a resolution that is trying to combat misinformation,"" Evans told CBC News.

Evans said the resolution is meant to target platforms like Twitter and Facebook and other websites that post misinformation. She also said some Canadian journalists ""post information they have not verified.""

It was ""probably a mistake"", Evans said, to use the technical term ""sources"" in the resolution rather than making it clear she was trying to target ""anonymous postings.""

""No one is trying to ask journalists to reveal sources,"" said Evans. ""If there are bylines on it, they're responsible for their sources. The journalist is then the source. If they're talking to non-credible sources, that's their problem.""

Michael Geist says it shouldn't be up to the government to decide who is a good journalist and who is a bad one. (Guillaume Lafrenière/CBC)

Geist said it shouldn't be up to the federal government to decide ""who is a good journalist and who is a bad journalist"" and come up with new regulations for those seen as ""not good.""

He said reputable journalists in Canada who use unnamed sources to break stories that make the government uncomfortable could ""land in the bucket of bad journalists"" because they didn't identify sources and are ""therefore subject to the regulation.""

Geist is calling on the Liberal government to distance itself from the proposal.

MP Rachael Thomas, the Conservatives' critic for Canadian heritage, pointed to stories that relied on journalists speaking to sources confidentially. She cited stories about the SNC-Lavalin affair and the ongoing controversy about the Liberal government's handling of foreign interference attempts.

Recent reporting by the Globe and Mail and Global News on foreign interference relied on confidential sources who risked arrest for violating Canada's official secrets law.

WATCH | Conservative MP Rachael Thomas calls Liberal policy resolution 'disheartening'

Conservative MP Rachael Thomas calls Liberal policy resolution ""disheartening"" Duration 0:42 A policy resolution passed at the Liberal convention to ""combat disinformation"" by exploring ""options to hold on-line information services accountable for the veracity of material published on their platforms and to limit publication only to material whose sources can be traced.""

""The moment we invite this state to do that, or mandate the state to do that, we now have state-run media, we now have state censorship,"" Thomas told CBC News.

""This is a very dangerous place to be. That likens us to places like North Korea, China, Iran, Russia. That is not Canada. That is a very, very dangerous direction.""

Thomas said her party supports freedom of the press and called the resolution ""disheartening."" She said that despite the stated intentions of the resolution's author, the ""actual written content of the motion"" is problematic.

WATCH/ NDP MP Peter Julian criticizes the government for its handling of disinformation

NDP MP Peter Julian criticizes the government for taking ""no action"" to target disinformation online Duration 0:59 Julian reacts to a controversial Liberal policy resolution to ""combat disinformation"" by exploring limiting ""publication only to material whose sources can be traced.""

NDP MP Peter Julian said he couldn't comment specifically on the resolution because ""it's vague.""

He said the government hasn't done enough to tackle disinformation, citing ""a number of NDP private members bills that would force companies"" to be more transparent.

""There is growing online harm and disinformation,"" he told CBC News. ""We're seeing the real world impacts of that. But we need a government that is willing to step forward and take action on this, and they have yet to do so.""

Liberal MP Greg Fergus said he thinks it's a ""great policy to discuss and debate ourselves.""



""I'm comfortable debating it,"" Fergus said of the resolution.

Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said the press plays an ""essential role in protecting democracy.""

""Do I think we need to pursue people and their ability to actually have faith that what's being reported is information they can rely on? Sure,"" said Fraser. ""But I don't want to be in the business of telling the press what they say about me.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

overhauls his cabinet, drops 7 ministers and shuffles most portfolios  CBC.ca","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today dropped seven ministers and changed nearly three-quarters of his cabinet, overhauling his team at a time of heightened tensions overseas and scandals at home.

Trudeau unveiled a new cabinet team meant to have a renewed focus on economic priorities, such as housing, during a ceremony at Rideau Hall Wednesday morning. The shuffle promotes seven new faces and tasks more than a dozen ministers with new roles, including a new minister of defence and public safety.

Reporters asked the prime minister repeatedly whether the shakeup amounts to an admission that his nearly eight-year-old government is slumping.

""On the contrary,"" he responded.

Recent polling indicates the Liberals are trailing the Conservatives. Opposition parties have criticized how the government has addressed the cost of living crisis.

WATCH | Trudeau says his new cabinet will 'step up' on critical issues

Trudeau says his new cabinet will 'step up' on critical issues Duration 2:11 When asked why Canadians should care about his new cabinet, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his team will be 'delivering' for Canadians on a range of issues, from climate change to affordability.

""This is a difficult time right now for millions of people in Canada and around the world, and making sure that we have the best possible team aligned to respond to Canadians' challenges with the supports necessary, but also show that optimism, that ambition for getting us through these consequential times and building a brighter future for everyone —that's what we're focused on,"" Trudeau said.

Amid those global challenges, Toronto-area MP Bill Blair takes over the defence portfolio from Anita Anand, who becomes president of the Treasury Board.

Blair, a former police chief who was most recently the minister of emergency preparedness, becomes the country's point person at NATO and will be responsible for Canada's response to the war in Ukraine.

The Canadian Armed Forces is also reeling from a sexual misconduct scandal; Blair is now responsible for overseeing the military's attempt to change its culture.

New Brunswick's Dominic LeBlanc will now lead public safety, an often-challenging portfolio that includes the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the RCMP. He also takes on the democratic institutions file and will continue to serve as intergovernmental affairs minister.

LeBlanc, who represents Beauséjour, will play a key role in determining how the government responds to allegations that China interfered in the past two federal elections, and to the damning report on the Mounties' handling of the 2020 mass shooting in Nova Scotia. He'll also have to stickhandle negotiations with the provinces about the future of RCMP contract policing.

His predecessor, Marco Mendicino, was dropped from cabinet. His demotion ends a tenure at the cabinet table plagued by multiple controversies, including the government's poorly received gun control legislation and lingering questions on the foreign interference file.

More recently, Mendicino was under intense pressure due to the controversy over the transfer of serial killer Paul Bernardo to a medium-security prison.

Along with the new names heading up security and intelligence-related portfolios, the Prime Minister's Office announced Wednesday it will follow the example of its Five Eye allies and set up a cabinet committee on national security and intelligence. The lack of one has been cited by the national security community as an oversight in light of recent controversies.

A PMO spokesperson called the new National Security Council a ""forum for ministers to deliberate on and address issues of pressing concern to Canada's domestic and international security.""

7 fresh faces called up

Seven new MPs received a promotion to cabinet:

Gould recently announced she is expecting her second child in the new year. Trudeau announced Wednesday that Government Whip Steve MacKinnon will serve as House leader in her absence and Ruby Sahota will fill in as whip.

The cabinet is now made up of 19 women and 20 men, including the prime minister himself.

Four of the seven ministers who were dropped announced earlier this week that they would not be running again:

Former public services and procurement minister Helena Jaczek

Former transport minister Omar Alghabra

Former mental health and addictions minister Carolyn Bennett

Former fisheries minister Joyce Murray

Trudeau did not answer when reporters asked why Mendicino, former justice minister David Lametti and former president of the Treasury Board Mona Fortier were axed.

The prime minister said he was putting forward ""the strongest possible team with fresh energy and a range of skills.""

""I want to thank everyone who has served this country and this cabinet so well over the past number of years,"" he said.

Lametti released a statement Wednesday congratulating his former parliamentary secretary Virani and saying he was proud of what he accomplished in the role.

""Confidence in our justice system is central to the rule of law. One way of building that confidence is by reaching out to communities who feel alienated from our justice system: Indigenous people, black and racialized communities,"" he wrote.

""This was an important priority for me.""

In his own media statement, Mendicino said it was an honour to serve as public safety minister and thanked members of the national security and law enforcement communities.

""Thank you for putting yourselves in harm's way to protect Canadians every single day. We do not say this nearly enough,"" he wrote.

""To my cabinet and caucus colleagues, it remains a privilege to work with you. The seating arrangements may move around in the House or Commons from time to time, but we are family and committed to the same cause.""

Fortier tweeted that it was a privilege to serve in cabinet.

WATCH | Poilievre says cabinet shuffle amounts to PM admitting 'he broke the economy'

Poilievre says cabinet shuffle amounts to PM admitting 'he broke the economy' Duration 1:02 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet shuffle was an attempt to blame many of the challenges facing Canadians on outgoing ministers, and to avoid taking responsibility himself.

The cabinet reset did little to impress Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

""After eight years of Trudeau, everything costs more,"" he told a news conference in Timmins, Ont.

""His government is a failure. It's funny, though — the one minister responsible for those failures didn't get moved. And that minister is Justin Trudeau.""

Singh still plans on backing Liberals

This new cabinet is believed to be the team Trudeau will take into the next election.

The Liberal minority government is being propped up by the NDP through a confidence-and-supply agreement that's set to last until 2025, but either party could trigger an election earlier.

As part of that deal, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has agreed to support the government on key House of Commons votes in exchange for the government championing some of his priorities, like dental care.

Following Wednesday's shuffle, Singh called the government a failure on key files like housing affordability but didn't suggest he was willing to pull his support.

""Our priority isn't triggering an election. It's forcing the government to work for people,"" said Singh.

""We are focused on getting results for people, not focused on forcing an election.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

personality arrested after an encounter with Chrystia Freeland  CBC.ca,"Rebel News personality David Menzies was arrested Monday for allegedly assaulting a police officer while trying to ask Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland questions about the government's decision to leave the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) off the designated terrorist entity list.

The website posted a video of Menzies briefly colliding with a police officer in Richmond Hill, Ont., while trying to question Freeland about the IRGC at an event to mark the destruction of Flight PS752, a Ukrainian International Airlines jetliner that was destroyed by the Iranian military in January 2020 — an attack that killed dozens of Canadians.

The video of Monday's encounter appears to show an officer stepping into Menzies' path while the media personality was carrying his microphone in the parking lot of a suburban strip mall.

That officer subsequently grabbed Menzies by his lapels, pushed him against a wall and accused him of assault while putting him under arrest.

""Police — you're under arrest for assault. You pushed into me, sir,"" the unidentified officer said.

(Video courtesy Rebel News)

""I didn't touch a single person,"" Menzies said in response.

""This is a trumped-up charge of assault, folks. I didn't come here to cause any trouble. I came here to do my job and now I'm handcuffed. This is your Canada now, folks. This is the gestapo taking blackface's orders,"" Menzies continued — an apparent reference to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who also attended the event.

Menzies asked the officer for his name and badge number but answers to those questions — if they were provided — aren't audible on the tape.

The officer in the video was later identified by a York Regional Police spokesperson as a member of the RCMP protective detail.

""The arrest of the Rebel News reporter was made by the prime minister's RCMP security detail. York Regional Police officers assisted as the interaction took place in our region,"" the spokesperson said.

""It was determined that no credible security threat existed and the subject was released unconditionally shortly thereafter.""

A spokesperson for the RCMP said ""protective policing resources were involved in an incident while deployed on a protective operation.""

""The RCMP is looking into the incident and the actions of all parties involved. No further comment is available at this time,"" the spokesperson said.

Freeland, who has been the target of threats and tense public confrontations in the past, is routinely monitored by police for her safety.

Previous run-ins with police

The finance minister ignored Menzies' questions and did not say anything as the arrest unfolded.

Menzies is a provocative figure who has had run-ins with police and security services in the past — including an apprehension by Trudeau's protective detail at a Toronto event in 2021.

Menzies was also arrested for a 2021 encounter with now Conservative deputy leader Melissa Lantsman in Thornhill, Ont.

Lantsman, who is a lesbian, said Menzies' questions ""became homophobic and related to my sexual orientation.""

Menzies was also removed from a 2019 campaign event for then-Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.

Rebel News widely shared video of the latest incident, advertising ""SHOCK FOOTAGE"" on its website.

""Chrystia Freeland's bodyguards assault and arrest David Menzies when he asks her a question,"" said a headline on the website.

""The police lied about the assault. They're the ones who assaulted him,"" the website claimed in its post about the incident.

According to data from X, formerly Twitter, parts of the video have been seen by millions of social media users.

Rebel News founder considering legal action

Reached by email Tuesday, Ezra Levant, the founder and owner of Rebel News, said he and Menzies are considering legal action against the police for what transpired.

""We have not yet finalized our legal strategy, but at this point I would expect that we will sue both the RCMP and the York Regional Police, as well as Chrystia Freeland, for false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and assault,"" Levant told CBC News.

WATCH | Hear what the Power Panel had to say: The political optics around the arrest of Rebel News employee | Power & Politics Duration 16:15 The Mounties are facing criticism for arresting Rebel News personality David Menzies as Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland arrived at an event Monday. Charges were later dropped after police found 'no credible security threat,' York Regional Police say. The Power Panel weighs in on the political optics of the arrest.

""These government defendants will have unlimited public resources, whereas we take no public funds. Therefore we will crowdfund David's litigation.""

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre condemned the arrest, reposting a video of the incident with the message: ""This is the state of freedom of the press. In Canada. In 2024. After eight years of Trudeau.""

Conservative MP Marilyn Gladu, the party's civil liberties critic, said in a media statement she wants the House of Commons heritage committee to be recalled from its winter break to study the matter and ""demand transparency and accountability"" regarding Menzies' arrest.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

government looking to cut $1 billion from National Defence budget  CBC.ca,"The Liberal government is looking to cut almost $1 billion from the annual budget of the Department of National Defence (DND) — a demand the country's top military commander says is prompting some ""difficult"" conversations within the military.

Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre and Deputy Minister of Defence Bill Matthews testified before the House of Commons defence committee late Thursday, where they acknowledged in more detail the ramifications of the federal government's spending reduction plan.

Earlier this month, Eyre and Matthews released a joint internal statement warning that the department would be expected to contribute to the federal government's overall plan to reduce spending.

Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre told MPs there's 'no way' to take $1 billion out of the defence budget without 'an impact.' (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)

""There's no way that you can take almost a billion dollars out of the defence budget and not have an impact,"" Eyre told the four-party committee. ""This is something that we're wrestling with now.""

DND's main estimates for 2023-24 say the department's budget for this year is expected to be $26.5 billion.

Late Friday, Defence Minister Bill Blair issued a series of posts on social media denying the budget will be cut, putting himself at odds with his two most senior officials.

""Canada's defence spending has increased year after year under our government. That spending growth will continue,"" Blair wrote on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.

""We're reviewing spending to find savings on things like consulting and travel, but overall spending on defence will continue to grow.""

He defended the amount of money the Liberals have put into defence since being elected in 2015.

""From protecting Canadians during forest fires and floods, to training Ukrainians and supporting our NATO allies, our Canadian Armed Forces always deliver for Canada,"" Blair wrote.

""We'll continue to invest in them, so that they have the tools they need to do their jobs. Any claim that Canada is 'cutting' defence spending is not accurate, because overall defence spending has increased and will continue to increase.""

WATCH | 'Difficult' conversations coming on defence spending, chief of the defence staff says 'Difficult' conversations coming on defence spending, chief of the defence staff says Duration 0:29 During a meeting of the Senate defence committee Thursday, Chief of the Defence Staff General Wayne Eyre told Parliamentarians about the impact of cutting the close to $1 billion the Liberals have said they'll shave off the defence budget.

With their 2017 defence policy and subsequent budgets — including a 20-year $38 billion plan to modernize NORAD — the Liberals have increased defence spending and have pledged to continue to do so.

Blair's statement is at odds with what the committee heard, however.

Answering a question about proposed cuts from the Bloc Quebecois before the committee on Thursday, Blair acknowledged the exercise was underway.

""We are looking very carefully at expenditures. It may require, for example, that we make different choices,"" the minister said, citing one possible area of reduction: the number of professional services contracts the department issues.

Cutting those services would not amount to $1 billion in annual savings, however.

While he didn't state it directly, Blair's posts suggest the Liberals will claim they'll continue to put additional money into defence — just not as much as they had planned earlier.

""We have to, to look very carefully at expenditures,"" Blair said. ""It may actually require some of the investments that we know we have to make — we may have to make over a longer period of time in response to the current fiscal situation.""

WATCH | Canadian military relaxes rules to boost recruitment: Canadian military relaxes rules to try and increase recruits Duration 2:11 The Canadian Armed Forces has introduced relaxed rules for service terms and appearance — allowing longer hair and facial hair — as strategies it hopes will help recruit and retain members.

On Thursday, Eyre said that earlier in the day he'd had a ""very difficult session"" with the commanders of the various services. He said that meeting was intended ""to explain this to our people"" at a time when the international situation is becoming increasingly precarious — partly due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Word of the planned cuts, which have not been specified, comes just weeks after the Liberal government agreed with other NATO allies on a pledge to make the alliance's defence spending benchmark of two per cent of gross domestic product an ""enduring commitment.""

Living up to that pledge would require a substantial increase in the defence appropriation.

Cuts could undermine Canada's NATO commitment

According to NATO's latest annual report, Canada spent an estimated 1.3 per cent of its GDP on the military last year — well below the target. Coming out of the alliance's summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Liberal government faced a storm of bad press and increased pressure from allies to step up its financial commitment.

How the planned cuts will affect Canada's commitment to NATO is unclear. Germany also recently walked back its pledge to meet the two per cent target.

Matthews told the defence committee Thursday that the process of identifying proposed cuts is underway and will lead to a spending reduction of ""nearly, I think ... $900 million and change, [which will] ramp up over four years.""

While he insisted the cuts will be prioritized so that ""they have the least amount of impact possible,"" he acknowledged that ""there will be impact.""

Matthews said the spending reductions will be aimed at ""minimizing impact on military readiness.""

WATCH: Defence critic questions budget plan for Defence Conservative MP wants assurances cuts won't affect military capabilities Duration 2:32 Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned Bill Mathews of the Department of National Defence on planned cuts to the department. Mathews says the DND is aiming at the 'least amount of impact possible.'

Conservative defence critic James Bezan demanded assurances on that point.

""What's going to give here on a billion dollars this year?"" he asked. ""And how are we going to deal with the threat environment that we're in if we're going to continue to cut rather than invest in our Canadian Armed Forces?""

Treasury Board President Anita Anand, the former defence minister, told other federal cabinet ministers in August they will be required to cut $15.4 billion in government spending and that they had until Oct. 2 to present their ideas.

At the time, Anand said the Liberal government wanted to ensure money was spent wisely while delivering on key government promises such as dental and child care.

Blair suggested to the defence committee that some of the savings could be attained by putting off planned equipment spending.

""We do know that we have to look very carefully at the expenditures,"" he said.

""It may actually require some of the investments that we know we have to make, [that] we may have to make over a longer period of time in response to the current fiscal situation.""","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

cyberattack out of China, investigators say  CBC.ca","The Canadian branch of Amnesty International was the target of a sophisticated cyber-security breach this fall — an attack forensic investigators believe originated in China with the blessing of the government in Beijing.

The intrusion was first detected on October 5, the human rights group said Monday.

The attack showed signs of being the work of what's known as an advanced persistent-threat group (APT), according to the cyber security company that conducted the forensic investigation.

Unlike a typical cybercrime attack, the attack on Amnesty involved establishing covert surveillance of the operating system of Amnesty's network, said the report prepared for Amnesty International Canada by the U.K.-based cybersecurity firm Secureworks.

The hackers appeared to be attempting to obtain a list of Amnesty's contacts and monitor its plans.

The revelation comes as relations between Canada and China remain frosty on several fronts.

Secureworks said it's confident in its conclusion that Beijing — or a group affiliated with the Chinese government — was responsible for the breach.

""This assessment is based on the nature of the targeted information as well as the observed tools and behaviours, which are consistent with those associated with Chinese cyberespionage threat groups,"" said the report.

Ketty Nivyabandi, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada, said the experience should offer a clear warning to other human rights groups and civil society members.

""This case of cyberespionage speaks to the increasingly dangerous context in which activists, journalists and civil society alike must navigate today,"" she said.

""Our work to investigate and call out these acts has never been more critical and relevant. We will continue to shine a light on human rights violations wherever they occur and to denounce the use of digital surveillance by governments to stifle human rights.""

Mike McLellan, director of intelligence for Secureworks, said targeting human rights groups falls under China's recent methods of operation.

""China uses its cyber capabilities to gather political and military intelligence and spy, and organizations like Amnesty are interesting to China because of the people they work with, the work that they do,"" McLellan told CBC News. ""We see organizations like this targeted because China is interested in surveillance.""

He said he doesn't believe there's any connection between the tense current nature of the Canada-China relationship and the timing of the cyber attack.

""I think it's much more about Amnesty Canada than Canada-China,"" McLellan said.

Four days after the release of the Amnesty report, the Chinese embassy in Ottawa issued a sternly-worded denial accusing the human rights group of misleading the public and ""spreading lies and rumours about China.""

""As a staunch defender of cybersecurity, we firmly oppose and combat attacks of any kind. China will never encourage, support, or connive in such cyber attacks,"" said the unsigned statement.

Last summer, another Massachusetts-based cybersecurity firm — Recorded Future — issued a report warning that hacking groups suspected of acting for the Chinese government have been involved in a multi-year espionage campaign against numerous governments, NGOs, think-tanks and news agencies.

The report said that campaign has targeted the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), Amnesty International, the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), Radio Free Asia (RFA), the American Institute in Taiwan, Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and India's National Informatics Centre since 2019.

Canadian-based Citizen Lab, an internet watchdog group, published a major study in 2016 that showed it and other civil society organizations have been penetrated by cyberspies, many of them linked to China.

Targeted by 'state-sponsored' spies

The study drew on four years of research with Tibet Action and nine other cooperating civil society groups. Eight were China or Tibet-focused; two were large international human rights organizations.

As part of that groundbreaking study, more than 800 suspicious emails were examined for malicious software by Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy.

Nivyabandi said Amnesty International Canada is aware the work it does can make it a target.

""As an organization advocating for human rights globally, we are very aware that we may be the target of state-sponsored attempts to disrupt or surveil our work,"" she said.

""These will not intimidate us and the security and privacy of our activists, staff, donors, and stakeholders remain our utmost priority.""

She said the relevant authorities, staff, donors and stakeholders have been told of the breach and the organization will continue to work with security experts to guard against future risks.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"

air hazard notification system experiences brief disruption  CBC.ca,"The computer system that alerts airlines and pilots flying in Canadian airspace to potential hazards experienced a brief disruption on Wednesday.

The system, called the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system, is operated by Nav Canada, a private non-profit that owns and operates Canada's air traffic control system.

Nav Canada said it began experiencing problems with the NOTAM entry system on Wednesday morning that left it unable to send new updates to airlines.

No flights were delayed as a result, said Nav Canada, and the system came back online in the early afternoon.

""We continue to monitor our systems and investigate the cause,"" the company tweeted.

Later Wednesday evening, Nav Canada said it believed the issue was caused by a computer hardware failure. The agency ruled out the possibility that it was caused by a cyber attack.

Prolonged outage in the U.S.

A number of Canadian flights to and from the U.S. were disrupted Tuesday and Wednesday due to a breakdown in the U.S. NOTAM system.

A computer outage that started Tuesday night resulted in thousands of delays and hundreds of flight cancellations quickly cascading through the system at airports across the U.S.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said the cause of the outage is not yet clear. Nav Canada said it doesn't believe its own outage is related to the one south of the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cbc.ca', 'title': 'CBC.ca'}"
