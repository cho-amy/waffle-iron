In Florida, Trump’s attorneys told Judge Aileen Cannon his Mar-a-Lago classified documents case should wait until after the 2024 election. At roughly the same time in Georgia, attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants made their final arguments to Judge Scott McAfee in a bid to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in the Georgia racketeering case over her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

Neither judge made a decision on Friday. But both hearings could have a significant impact on when – or whether – Trump will face trial in each of those two cases.

Here's a look at the key takeaways from each of the proceedings:

Judge Cannon doesn’t tip her hand on trial date in Trump’s classified docs case: In the classified documents case, Cannon didn’t tip her hand Friday on when she might set a new trial date, but she asked questions about the prospect of holding a trial close to Election Day with the former president likely on the ballot.

In the classified documents case, Cannon didn’t tip her hand Friday on when she might set a new trial date, but she asked questions about the prospect of holding a trial close to Election Day with the former president likely on the ballot. Judge McAfee suggests discipline could be the solution if Fani Willis lied: In the Georgia case, McAfee suggested Friday that if it ends up that the lead Fulton County prosecutors lied on the witness stand about their romantic relationship, the remedy might be a professional disciplinary action at the state bar, instead of the much more aggressive step of removing them from the Trump case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to convince Judge Aileen Cannon that she will need to hold a hearing on their request for more discovery from several agencies and the White House.

Their request depends on an argument that officials from those agencies were advising prosecutors on prosecutorial decisions that essentially make them members of the prosecution team.

Cannon seemed open to the idea of holding a hearing, but pressed Trump attorney Emil Bove on what such a hearing would focus on and how it would work. Bove pointed to several examples of what he said was collaboration between multiple government agencies like the National Archives and the White House.

Bove added that a hearing where prosecutors would address some of these arguments would have to take place in a secure location, especially since it would touch on how classified material in the case was reviewed.

Prosecutors denied these claims of inter-agency collaboration earlier in the hearing.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Firing back against critics who say his own age is a liability in the upcoming election, 81-year-old Biden told Seth Meyers, “You got to take a look at the other guy,” referring to the 77-year-old Trump.

“He’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name,” he joked, in an apparent reference to an episode over the weekend where the former president mistakenly called his wife Melania “Mercedes” during remarks at CPAC.

During the interview on NBC’s “Late Night,” Biden said voters should not just consider how old a candidate is, but “how old (their) ideas are.”

Biden’s comments about Trump’s age could mark a notable shift in the president’s messaging strategy, coming just days after Trump won the South Carolina Republican primaries in another step toward grabbing his party’s presidential nomination. The two men have not often attacked each other over their age and Trump has previously said he doesn’t believe Biden is too old to run for reelection. Instead of attacking Biden directly over his age, Trump instead tries to paint Biden as “incompetent,” and “cognitively impaired,” which he argues is not solely about the president’s age.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rebecca Blackwell/AP

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

House TV

The GOP-led House has voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The vote tally was 214 to 213. Three Republicans voted with Democrats against the measure.

This comes after House Republicans failed to impeach Mayorkas in a vote last week. The absence of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and the surprise attendance by Texas Democrat Al Green, who had just had surgery and was wheeled into the chamber to vote, denied Republicans the votes to pass when it came up previously.

House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar.

The impeachment effort comes as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue: the border.

What happens next: It is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be charged in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Senate Democrats are still weighing how to respond on Mayorkas' impeachment: to Move ahead with a trial, or move to dismiss it quickly given their view that it’s blatantly political.

Here's a breakdown of the vote:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Nominees were chosen by county party leaders in the district.

Democrats nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represented a previous version of the 3rd District for three terms before launching an unsuccessful primary campaign for governor in 2022. Republicans nominated Mazi Pilip, a county legislator who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the US from Israel.

The contest has national stakes and could serve as a bellwether for the mood of the electorate this presidential cycle.

The state’s propensity for picking the eventual GOP nominee is unmatched by any other early-voting state. Since 1980, the only Republican to win the nomination without winning South Carolina was Mitt Romney in 2012.

This year, if history holds, it could mean the beginning of the end for Nikki Haley’s campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is dominating the polls. The former president has led every single poll in the state by at least 20 points this year. Surveys that meet CNN’s standards for publication have Trump up by at least 30 points this month.

To put that in perspective, I can’t find a single example of a well-polled presidential primary in the past 40 years in which a candidate has overcome the deficit Haley currently faces in her home state.

(Democrat Bernie Sanders’ 2016 Michigan primary win was the biggest recent shocker, and CNN approved surveys had him down by less than 20 points going into the election.)

Another ominous sign for Haley: Since the modern primary era began in 1972, no major-party nominee has ever lost his or her home state during the primary season. To that point, Trump has shown a knack for beating fellow Republicans in the states where they were first elected.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Republican presidential primary season has been one long slog for the past month and half.

Just three states – Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – have had caucuses or primaries in which both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were on the ballot. The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.

Tuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.

This is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.

Now, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump has been laying the groundwork for a 2024 general election battle over the working-class voters who helped propel him to the White House in 2016, but favored President Joe Biden in 2020.

Trump’s campaign believes it can drive a wedge between Biden and organized labor. It has made appealing to union members a key part of its strategy to win over working-class voters, especially in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — all three of whom broke for Biden in the 2020 election after backing Trump four years earlier.

While in Michigan, Trump has argued that the influx of migrants would negatively effect union workers. During his September visit to a nonunion shop amid the autoworker strike he lamented that Biden’s policies encouraging a move to electric vehicles was threatening their jobs.

The United Auto Workers endorsed Biden in January — Trump responded by calling the organization’s president Shawn Fain a “weapon of mass destruction.”

Trump later met with Teamsters union leaders and members in Washington, DC, which angered one executive board member, who denounced Trump as “a known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.” Biden is expected to meet with the Teamsters next month.

Trump’s share of the vote of union households fell from 48% in 2016 to 37% in 2020, according to CNN exit polls. The recent Fox News survey from Michigan found Biden leading Trump 53% to 41% among union households. Regaining that support could prove key to turning Michigan red again in 2024.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday defended her decision to stay in the GOP primary race as her opponent Donald Trump is again expected to win in Michigan.

""We've only seen a handful of states vote. I mean, look, I've said this before as much as the media wants to jump ahead, we're taking this one state, one day at a time,"" she told CNN's Dana Bash.

Trump beat Haley by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands – and most notably last week in Haley's home state of of South Carolina where voters had elected her twice as their governor.

""America is blessed to be a democracy let people vote. Now in the next week, we're going to watch 20 states and territories vote,"" Haley said, referring to Super Tuesday on March 5. ""Let's let that happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Asked about Michigan, Democratic Sen. Dick Blumenthal told CNN: “I’m deeply concerned about this election and about holding together our coalition because there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed to make sure that we're unified and we can take nothing for granted. This will be a hard fought election, and we need every single vote.”

Reacting to the Michigan results, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin said Biden needs to be more direct in addressing concerns over the war in Gaza.

But Sen. Gary Peters, the Michigan Democrat, tried to ease concern, saying his state has a history of protest votes.

“Oh, I’m not concerned. It’s not unusual to have uncommitted. We’ve had that in all elections,” Peters said. “We continue to do our work to make sure that folks understand that voting for President Biden is absolutely critical for the future of this country.”

Senate Democrats largely seemed to agree Wednesday morning they were not worried about Biden’s performance in Michigan and argued that when the choice is between Biden and former President Donald Trump, voters will come back to Biden in the general election.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said “I think voters will come home in November. I think you had a lot of people who wanted to express their concern.” But Van Hollen did admit that the numbers last night suggested the administration may need to have shifted its message on Gaza sooner and may need to do more to ensure humanitarian aid gets to the region.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, says he had no concerns about the number of uncommitted voters last night, saying Biden’s numbers were “fantastic.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 1,508 interviews with Republican primary voters across 38 different polling places on Election Day. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Junfu Han/Detroit Free Press/USA Today Network

A Michigan court has affirmed the removal of Kristina Karamo as the state’s Republican Party chair, in a move that could settle a bitter leadership dispute just days before the party’s convention this weekend.

In a preliminary injunction issued Tuesday, Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi said Karamo was properly removed from her position on January 6, when Michigan’s GOP state committee voted to oust her, and that any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.”

Tuesday’s ruling, a copy of which was published by NBC News, also prevents Karamo from representing herself as chair of the Michigan Republican State Committee or conducting business on behalf of the party.

Tuesday’s development was a victory for Pete Hoekstra, a former ambassador and representative who has been recognized by the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump as the rightful chair of the Michigan Republican Party.

The Michigan GOP is set to hold its convention on Saturday, when it will allocate the state’s delegates for the Republican National Convention. Karamo had planned a rival convention, potentially complicating the process.

CNN previously reported that under Karamo’s leadership, the Michigan GOP suffered from internal strife and lackluster finances. A CNN investigation published in late 2023 found the party’s financial problems had become so bad that an internal report revealed the state party had a net income of just $71,000 over a nine-month period that ended with it $600,000 in debt.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

A former FBI informant charged with falsely telling his handler that the Bidens accepted multimillion-dollar bribes will remain in jail while he awaits trial, a federal judge ruled Monday.

US District Judge Otis Wright said that “there is nothing garden variety” about the criminal case involving former informant Alexander Smirnov, whom Wright said has a “habit or practice of making false statements.”

“I have not changed my mind,” Wright said. “The defendant will be remanded pending trial.”

Smirnov, a 43-year-old dual US-Israeli citizen, is accused of telling his handler that a Ukrainian energy company paid $5 million in bribes each to President Joe Biden and his son Hunter – an allegation that prosecutors say was a complete fabrication.

“The records are fairly clear,” prosecutor Leo Wise said. Smirnov “made it all up.”

Smirnov has pleaded not guilty to the two charges he faces for allegedly lying to his handler and falsifying records. A magistrate judge in Las Vegas, where Smirnov lives, had ordered that Smirnov could leave jail and be subject to GPS monitoring. Smirnov was re-arrested days later, however, while meeting with his attorneys.

As President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump head to Texas, a federal judge in Austin has ordered the state government to suspend enforcement of a controversial law that would allow state law enforcement agents to arrest and detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally.

“If allowed to procced, SB 4 could open the door to each state passing its own version of immigration laws,” Judge David Alan Ezra wrote, granting a preliminary injunction against the law.

The judge rejected the state’s argument that the current influx of migrants across the southern border is an “invasion” that Texas has the right to stop unilaterally. “SB 4 threatens the fundamental notion that the United States must regulate immigration with one voice,” Ezra wrote.

Without action from the court, the law was set to go into effect on Tuesday. Plaintiffs include the federal government and El Paso County, which claims enforcing the law would strain its jail system with thousands of new arrests.

“El Paso County applauds the court’s clear confirmation today that immigration policies rest solely under Federal jurisdiction, and the state of Texas’ interference with the U.S. Constitution will not be tolerated,” said Iliana Holguin, a commissioner for El Paso County.

CNN reached out to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AP

In an extraordinary moment in court Thursday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testified about sexist behavior from Nathan Wade, the top prosecutor on the election interference case with whom she once had a romantic relationship.

“It's interesting that we're here about this money. Mr. Wade is used to women that, as he told me one time: 'The only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich,'” she testified as she faced tough questioning from defense attorney Steve Sadow, who represents Donald Trump, about whether their romantic relationship ended last summer because of the forthcoming indictment against the former president and his allies.

“We would have brutal arguments about the fact that I am your equal,"" she continued. ""I don't need anything from a man — a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back. I don't need anybody to foot my bills. The only man who's ever foot my bills completely is my daddy.”

The defense attorneys have zeroed in on the timing of when the Willis-Wade relationship ended because it's critical to their self-dealing allegations against Willis.

In court filings, defendant Mike Roman's team argued that Willis would be incentivized to bring an indictment because it would prolong the case, and keep the money flowing to Wade. And, according to their theory, back to her as well, through vacations and other gifts.

Willis said on the stand that their break-up had “absolutely nothing” to do with the indictment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

There was a muted response in the room of Nikki Haley’s campaign party when CNN projected that Donald Trump would win the South Carolina primary — until the former president started speaking.

A man started waving a South Carolina loves Nikki Haley sign in front of the projection of Trump speaking, and moments later chants for Haley broke out.

“I don’t think it is over,” Nell Parker, a Haley supporter in the room told CNN. Parker said she plans to rally North Carolina for Haley, and feels good about her odds going forward.

“We are for anyone against Trump,” said another Haley supporter in the room.

Others said they did not trust the projection, and were frustrated about polls generally.

No one in the room said they believe this is the beginning of the end for Haley.

The Haley campaign say they feel that they did everything they could to effectively compete in South Carolina, but aides said frustrations arose throughout the last month given the strong hold that Trump has on the state. For example, the Republican group at Clemson University endorsed Trump, which was frustrating for Haley’s team given the school is her alma mater.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 1,508 interviews with Republican primary voters across 38 different polling places on Election Day. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

As the evidentiary hearing got under way, an attorney for the Fulton County district attorney’s office told the judge that the entire motion over whether District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified ought to be dismissed.

Adam Abbate told the judge: “We’ve been able to determine that the claims the defendant has … are not only legally meritless” but are also “patiently false.”

The judge, Scott McAfee, denied Abbate’s renewed effort to stop the hearing.

Abbate argued that the testimony of one of the key witnesses in the case, Terrence Bradley, would be blocked by attorney-client privilege. Bradley represented Nathan Wade in his divorce proceedings. In this hearing, McAfee will consider allegations that Willis and Wade, he top prosecutor, engaged in a romantic relationship.

“We’d ask to renew our motion to quash,” Abbate said.

Ashleigh Merchant, the defense attorney who brought the claims against Wade and Willis, argued that the hearing should continue. “Let’s hear from some witnesses, judge,” Merchant said. “This is a very important issue and we need to have witnesses.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Before entering the courtroom in New York on Thursday morning, Trump claimed the hush money case against him is “election interference.” He also argued that it is interfering with his ability to campaign in South Carolina ahead of the February 24 Republican presidential primary there.

“How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again — this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said.

Trump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in South Carolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.”

Facts First: Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in New York on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances.

Rather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a hearing related to charges he faces in Georgia.

And he had not been scheduled to be in South Carolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the New York hearing. His next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week. His next rally after the Thursday hearing is a Saturday event in Michigan.

Trump is not planning to fly to South Carolina after the New York hearing. He is planning to fly back to Florida, where he lives.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on February 16, in Atlanta. Alyssa Pointer/Pool/Getty Images

John Floyd, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ father, testified Friday that he taught his daughter to “hide cash” in case she needed it.

“What I told my child from the time she was a child was always have some money,” Floyd said, adding that he told her to always have “six months of cash always.”

Defense attorneys had pushed Willis over why she would keep a prevalence of cash in her home, which she said used to pay Nathan Wade back for various expenses. Floyd’s testimony corroborates Willis’ statements that she was taught to always have cash handy.

“Maybe, and excuse me your honor, I’m not trying to be racist, but it’s a black thing,” Floyd said. “I was trained, and most black folks, they hide cash or they keep cash, and I was trained you always keep some cash.”

“I gave my daughter her first cash box and told her, ‘always keep some cash,’” Floyd said.

Floyd referenced a time he had trouble paying for his meal at a restaurant several years ago to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“I had a American Express credit card and maybe a Visa,” Floyd said, as well as “a lot of what they call traveler’s checks.”

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 1,508 interviews with Republican primary voters across 38 different polling places on Election Day. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Junfu Han/Detroit Free Press/USA Today Network

A Michigan court has affirmed the removal of Kristina Karamo as the state’s Republican Party chair, in a move that could settle a bitter leadership dispute just days before the party’s convention this weekend.

In a preliminary injunction issued Tuesday, Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi said Karamo was properly removed from her position on January 6, when Michigan’s GOP state committee voted to oust her, and that any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.”

Tuesday’s ruling, a copy of which was published by NBC News, also prevents Karamo from representing herself as chair of the Michigan Republican State Committee or conducting business on behalf of the party.

Tuesday’s development was a victory for Pete Hoekstra, a former ambassador and representative who has been recognized by the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump as the rightful chair of the Michigan Republican Party.

The Michigan GOP is set to hold its convention on Saturday, when it will allocate the state’s delegates for the Republican National Convention. Karamo had planned a rival convention, potentially complicating the process.

CNN previously reported that under Karamo’s leadership, the Michigan GOP suffered from internal strife and lackluster finances. A CNN investigation published in late 2023 found the party’s financial problems had become so bad that an internal report revealed the state party had a net income of just $71,000 over a nine-month period that ended with it $600,000 in debt.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The rest will be awarded at a state party convention Saturday. Former President Donald Trump defeated GOP rival Nikki Haley in the primary.

The split contests are the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in their new lineup.

Republicans opposed an earlier Michigan primary, which violated Republican National Committee rules limiting which states can hold contests before March 1. After Democrats, who control the legislature and the governor’s office, moved the Michigan primary to February 27 despite the Republican opposition, the RNC and the Michigan GOP came up with the hybrid model.

Further complicating matters: The Michigan GOP is in the middle of a battle over who actually leads the party, with two people who claim to be the party’s leaders scheduling dueling conventions Saturday. The RNC and Trump have recognized Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman and US ambassador to the Netherlands, as chair; Hoekstra scheduled a Saturday convention in Grand Rapids. However, Kristina Karamo, the election conspiracy theorist who the state party voted to oust in January, has refused to relinquish control, arguing she was unlawfully removed. She has planned a convention in Detroit.

Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi on Tuesday affirmed Karamo’s removal as state party chair, saying any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.” She has not yet said whether the convention she planned for Detroit would go forward. Regardless of Karamo’s actions, the RNC’s decision to recognize Hoekstra signaled the party would accept delegates from the convention he will oversee.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal dismissed concerns over the potential weakness of President Joe Biden’s electoral coalition — which has faced challenges amid concerns from Arab Americans and progressives over the administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

""I think the Biden coalition is strong, alive and well and focused on the basic accomplishments of this administration, as it will be on election day. I am very, very hopeful that a pause can diminish some of the apparent friction involved in that coalition, but I think it will hold together,"" the senator from Connecticut told CNN.

His comments come ahead of today’s Democratic primary in Michigan where there has been an organized effort, including by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian American, to send a message to the Biden campaign by urging voters to vote ""uncommitted.""

Blumenthal’s emphasis on a potential pause in the fighting in Gaza, which Biden said could possibly be reached as early as the end of this upcoming weekend, illustrates the ongoing political ramifications of the war.

Blumenthal also added that he’s ""very concerned"" about a government shutdown, pointing to its possible catastrophic consequences.

There was a muted response in the room of Nikki Haley’s campaign party when CNN projected that Donald Trump would win the South Carolina primary — until the former president started speaking.

A man started waving a South Carolina loves Nikki Haley sign in front of the projection of Trump speaking, and moments later chants for Haley broke out.

“I don’t think it is over,” Nell Parker, a Haley supporter in the room told CNN. Parker said she plans to rally North Carolina for Haley, and feels good about her odds going forward.

“We are for anyone against Trump,” said another Haley supporter in the room.

Others said they did not trust the projection, and were frustrated about polls generally.

No one in the room said they believe this is the beginning of the end for Haley.

The Haley campaign say they feel that they did everything they could to effectively compete in South Carolina, but aides said frustrations arose throughout the last month given the strong hold that Trump has on the state. For example, the Republican group at Clemson University endorsed Trump, which was frustrating for Haley’s team given the school is her alma mater.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

""I want to make it clear that today's vote is an appeal to the White House, it is an appeal to President Biden to be the leader that we know he can, a leader that he promised the nation he would be in 2020, when he campaigned saying that he was going to restore dignity and humanity to the White House,"" the Democratic representative from Michigan's 3rd District told CNN.

Farhat said that there are thousands of Michiganders who are watching the atrocities overseas with horror and anguish. They're watching ""their loved ones dying, children starving to death and they're hearing the screams of parents who are holding their children, their lifeless children,"" he said. He said the coalition wants to see an effort toward restoring humanitarian aid and lasting peace.

Farhat added that the push to vote uncommitted during the primary will probably not impact Biden winning, but those involved are building a diverse coalition to show the White House that there is a unified message calling for a ceasefire.

""The message though is that a plurality of voters, Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Gen Z voters are coming together — African American voters are coming together in a coalition to tell the president that, 'Hey, we want — we want to see you call for the ceasefire. We want to see our White House reflect the values that we know it should reflect,'"" Farhat said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9. The trial is currently set to start in May.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Two of the Big Three companies, GM and Chrysler, went bankrupt in 2009 and needed federal bailouts to survive.

That took a bite not only out of employment, but out of auto wages, as the United Auto Workers union agreed to deep concessions, including a lower tier of wages, to help keep all three companies alive. But that helped drag down wages in the state overall.

The state’s median household income was higher than the national average until 2000, according to the Growing Michigan Together Council, a group formed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to develop solutions to Michigan’s challenges. The state’s median income declined relative to the US level over the past five decades.

Today, the median household income in the state was just under $67,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau.

However, following a six-week strike last fall at GM, Ford and Stellantis, the United Auto Workers union won immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members. Pay for members is expected to rise more than 30% during the life of the contract, which expires in 2028.

While jobs in the state’s auto and parts plants have stabilized in recent years, jobs in the manufacturing sector overall have edged up by 4.5% since the end of 2020. But that still hasn’t recaptured jobs lost in that sector during the first year of the pandemic. Overall employment in the state in December was up 9.6% from the end of 2020, but still off 0.5% from December of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic.

Rebecca Cook/Reuters

President Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win tonight’s Democratic primary in Michigan. But that hasn’t stopped those who believe he should be pushing harder for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas from organizing a vote for “uncommitted.”

That is, a vote in the primary for “uncommitted” is a protest vote against Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza. It’s not clear how well this effort will do, but a high percentage of support could suggest general election trouble for Biden in the Wolverine State.

Take a look at the 2020 Republican presidential primaries: President Donald Trump romped to wins everywhere with 94% of the vote nationally, but his weakest region (or census subdivision) by far was New England. He was under 90% of the primary vote in all those states and even came in with less than 80% in Connecticut. In the general election, all the New England states swung against Trump by about 2 to 4 times as much as the swing against him nationally compared with 2016.

In the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, we saw a somewhat similar phenomenon. President Barack Obama won about 90% of the vote nationally. He got below 60% of the primary vote in a line of states from Oklahoma to Arkansas to Kentucky to West Virginia.

All four were among the six states that swung the most toward the Republican candidate on the presidential level from 2004 to 2012.

It’s not exactly clear what a low level of support tonight for Biden would be. Still, he got over 95% of the vote in South Carolina and nearly 90% in Nevada. If he falls significantly short of those levels, it could be ominous.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA/AP

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of House progressives, said the number of ""uncommitted"" votes in Michigan is a major warning sign for President Joe Biden in November.

“This is exactly what I warned about several months ago,” Jayapal told CNN. “The war on Gaza is a deep moral issue and the lack of attention and empathy for this perspective from the administration is breaking apart the fragile coalition we built to elect Joe Biden in 2020.”

Jayapal says there is “still a little bit of time to change this dynamic.” But she added: “It has to be a dramatic policy and rhetorical shift from the president on this issue and a new strategy to rebuild a real partnership with progressives in multiple communities who are absolutely key to winning the election.”

Organizers of the movement to vote ""uncommitted"" had hoped at least 10,000 people would cast their vote for the cause, a nod to the 10,700-vote margin that delivered the state to Donald Trump in 2016. They had far surpassed that goal just before 11 p.m. Tuesday night.

One of the leading voices in the campaign to vote “uncommitted,” former Democratic US Rep. Andy Levin, said the early numbers show a “historic” result. He said he felt the effort was a success in conveying people's anger to the president.

Levin’s message to voters who are mad about the war in Gaza was: “Don't stay home, don't stay home. Go out and shake your fist. Go to the ballot box and tell the president you're mad otherwise, he won’t know.”

Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to convince Judge Aileen Cannon that she will need to hold a hearing on their request for more discovery from several agencies and the White House.

Their request depends on an argument that officials from those agencies were advising prosecutors on prosecutorial decisions that essentially make them members of the prosecution team.

Cannon seemed open to the idea of holding a hearing, but pressed Trump attorney Emil Bove on what such a hearing would focus on and how it would work. Bove pointed to several examples of what he said was collaboration between multiple government agencies like the National Archives and the White House.

Bove added that a hearing where prosecutors would address some of these arguments would have to take place in a secure location, especially since it would touch on how classified material in the case was reviewed.

Prosecutors denied these claims of inter-agency collaboration earlier in the hearing.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Momentum to plot a swift impeachment of Mayorkas picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republicans expressed openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border.

Border authorities encountered more than 225,000 migrants along the US-Mexico border in December, marking the highest monthly total recorded since 2000, according to preliminary Homeland Security statistics shared with CNN. And in fiscal year 2022, according to the Department of Homeland Security, 1.4 million individuals who were encountered at the border were removed, which is more than in any previous year.

The border crisis has galvanized Republicans, unifying their party for more aggressive action on an issue central to the 2024 campaign, and a handful of the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to scuttle an effort to impeach Mayorkas in November 2023 recently signaled they’d back impeaching him if it went through the committee process, which happened late last month.

Moderate Republicans, including ones in districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020, also signaled more willingness to impeach Mayorkas than the president – a sign of the shifting political terrain on the issue.

While House Republicans have sought to use Mayorkas' impeachment to address their issues with Biden's handling of the border, the GOP also helped to tank – along with Donald Trump – a major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package that would have marked a tough change to immigration law championed by one of the Senate's most conservative members. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber, even if it ever made it out of the Senate.

Mayorkas wrote in a letter in advance of the vote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.”

Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images

In 2020, Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American activist and longtime Michigan Democrat, backed Joe Biden for president. But like many Arab Americans, she feels betrayed by his response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the rising civilian death toll. Biden would need to curtail US military aid to Israel and call for a permanent ceasefire before she could even consider supporting him in November, she said.

And as for Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Michigan, she’s leading the charge to convince Democrats to vote “uncommitted.” Elabed is the effort’s campaign manager and the sister of Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman in Congress.

The Listen to Michigan campaign was launched less than three weeks ago by Elabed and other Arab American activists in the Wolverine State. It’s a last-minute effort to send a “clear, sharp message” to Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party to address the concerns of the coalition that helped him win in 2020, Elabed said.

Since its launch, the effort has been endorsed by progressive groups such as Our Revolution and more than three dozen current and former state and local leaders, including Tlaib and former US Rep. Andy Levin. Volunteers have contacted more than 100,000 voters in the state, according to organizers.

The president’s reelection campaign has responded to the Listen to Michigan effort by emphasizing Biden’s domestic accomplishments, framing the general election as a binary choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump and stressing that the administration is listening to people’s concerns and open to future conversations.

Why this matters: If thousands of Michigan Democrats vote uncommitted Tuesday, it would be the clearest sign yet that Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza could cost him critical votes in November. Arab and Muslim Americans make up a substantial voting bloc in Michigan, a key battleground state.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Gary Peters heads to the floor of the Senate for a vote on Capitol Hill on February 11, in Washington, DC. Samuel Corum/Getty Images

Sen. Gary Peters, the chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm who hails from Michigan, downplayed the progressive-led effort to vote “uncommitted” in Tuesday’s primary as a form of protest over President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

“I'm not sure what we'll see tonight, we'll be watching that number. But it's certainly not unusual for people to vote uncommitted,” Peters told CNN, ticking off the number of uncommitted votes in previous cycles, including when Barack Obama was president and ran unopposed.

Asked if he harbors any concerns about cracks in Biden’s coalition, Peters said: “No, no, I don't see that. But we'll continue to hold that together and continue to be strong. You know, if you look at former President Trump — he has an opponent taking 40% in primaries away from him. To me that's more significant.”

However, others in the party have expressed concern about the organized “uncommitted” effort — led in part by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — even as they say they respect the views of voters and acknowledge it’s imperative for Biden to hear out their concerns in a key battleground state.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the other Michigan senator, said on CNN earlier today she thinks the campaign to urge voters to vote uncommitted is “certainly not helpful.”

And one House Democrat told CNN there is “massive” frustration inside the party over the effort, worried it could backfire if it winds up helping get Trump elected. “The president is weak enough without hobbling him more with a concerted campaign against him,” the lawmaker told CNN.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on February 15, in Atlanta, Georgia Alyssa Pointer/Pool/Getty Images

Several advisers and confidants of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis privately urged her in recent weeks to encourage top prosecutor Nathan Wade voluntarily step aside, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.

Willis is being advised by people inside and outside of the district attorney’s office, though one source said there is a difference of legal opinions about what to do next.

Willis and Wade have so far resisted the push for him to resign from the Georgia election subversion case, a stance that the two reinforced in their defiant testimony Thursday in an Atlanta-area courtroom where they pushed back on allegations that their now-ended romantic relationship created a disqualifying conflict of interest.

CNN previously reported that Willis had no plans to recuse herself from the case after allegations surfaced that she and Wade engaged in an improper romantic relationship. Sources familiar with the situation said prior to Thursday’s hearing that Wade also did not have immediate plans to step away from the case either but acknowledged his future was more uncertain.

Wade is interchangeable and could be replaced without forcing the case to be assigned to another prosecutor's office, multiple sources familiar with the situation stressed before and after he testified on Thursday.

It remains unclear if Wade’s testimony has moved the needle at all in terms of the likelihood he resigns. A spokesperson for the district attorney’s office declined to comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Trump, who is facing charges related to mishandling of classified documents, called it a ""sick and corrupt two-tiered system of justice.""

In a report released Thursday, Special Counsel Robert Hur did not recommend charges against Biden over his handling of classified documents. In his explanation for not recommending prosecution, Hur described the president as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”

Trump, addressing a National Rifle Association rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said Biden did ""a lot"" of the activity related to retaining documents ""when he was at a very young age.""

""He was mentally a little better than he is right now,"" he continued, addressing Biden's mental acuity, something he did not immediately seize on yesterday in the wake of the report.

The former president also said Biden had made recovery of classified documents by investigators ""almost impossible,"" later claiming that he cooperated with investigators more than Biden did.

However, Hur made clear in his report how different Biden's and Trump’s classified information cases are — namely, that Biden cooperated with investigators while Trump did not.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Evan Vucci/AP

On any other week, special counsel Robert Hur's writing that President Joe Biden could be perceived as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" would have been a damning portrait of a sitting president.

For Biden, however, the special counsel's comments about his memory came at an even more inopportune moment. On three separate occasions this week, Biden has confused the names of European leaders who died years ago with those who more recently served in office, raising more questions about his mental recall.

In those episodes, Biden was describing an international summit in 2021. He described speaking with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, and French President Francois Mitterrand, who died in 1996.

Only about 45 minutes before the report was released publicly, the White House was working to downplay to slip-ups, saying it’s common for people to misspeak.

“Many people, elected officials…they can misspeak sometimes,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, citing recent examples from House Speaker Mike Johnson and TV host Sean Hannity.

She said in meetings, she had never witnessed Biden confuse names.

Yet the picture Hur painted of Biden in the report went well beyond the occasional mistaken name. He said in interviews, the president did not remember the years he was vice president or when his son Beau died.

Immediately after the report was released, White House officials and Biden's personal lawyer forcefully rejected what they said were inappropriate and incorrect statements about his memory.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Norma Anderson, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to disqualify Donald Trump from office, is a lifelong Republican who has had a storied political career, including stints as the first-ever woman majority leader in both chambers of the Colorado legislature.

“I’m an old-fashioned Republican that believes in strong defense, supporting business, and helping those who don’t know how to help themselves, and less government, and a fair tax base,” Anderson said.

Here are some highlights of her career:

She spent 12 years in the statehouse , before having to leave due to term limits. While there, from 1997 to 1998, she was the majority leader of the lower chamber. After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003.

After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003. Her record: While serving in the Colorado statehouse, Anderson helped enact legislation to improve child literacy and lower the cost of in-state colleges and established a home nursing program with funds from a landmark lawsuit against the large tobacco companies.

Battling Trump – especially in court – comes with acclaim in some circles, and vitriol in others. Anderson said she has received a lot of support from friends and family, except for one or two holdouts who are still die-hard Trump supporters. She said most of her friends weren’t surprised that she got involved in the case.

“I was born four months before FDR was elected,” Anderson said. “I’ve lived through a lot of presidents. Some I liked, some I didn’t. But not one of them caused an insurrection, until Donald Trump.”

Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

A federal appeals court on Tuesday said that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency, flatly rejecting Trump’s arguments that he shouldn’t have to go on trial on federal election subversion charges.

Here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's decision:

Trump’s behavior after the 2020 election could be criminal: The judges made it clear that Trump's actions could be prosecuted in a court of law.

""Vital public interest"" of letting trial proceed weighed heavily on the court: The judges cited the public interest in accountability for potential crimes committed by a former president, and how that overcame Trump’s argument that immunity was necessary to protect the institution of the presidency. They flatly rejected Trump’s claim that his criminal indictment would have a “chilling effect” on future administrations.

Trial timing will be up to the Supreme Court: A key part of Trump’s legal strategy has been to delay his criminal cases until after the 2024 election. Now, the trial's timing will be in the hands of the Supreme Court. If Trump is successful with getting the Supreme Court to hear the appeal, the criminal trial would not resume until after the high court decides what to do with his request for a pause.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The Supreme Court appears poised to back former President Donald Trump and fend off a blockbuster challenge to his eligibility to appear on Colorado’s ballot as a presidential candidate in 2024, a move that would extract the justices from one of the most politically fraught appeals in the court’s history.

If Trump is pulled off the ballot in Colorado, Chief Justice John Roberts predicted that other states would eventually attempt to knock other candidates off the ballot. That, he signaled, would be inconsistent with the purpose and history of the 14th Amendment.

“It’ll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,” Roberts said. “That’s a pretty daunting consequence.”

At issue is a provision in the 14th Amendment that bars certain public officials from serving in the government again if they took part in an insurrection. The six Republican and independent voters from Colorado who challenged Trump say his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol makes him ineligible under that “insurrection ban.”

A majority of the conservative justices on the court posed tough questions to the lawyers representing the voters -- including whether the insurrection ban can be enforced without a law first passed by Congress – though it was unclear which route the court might take.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed the attorneys about a 19th century decision from a lower court that suggested it was congress, not states, that must act first on enforcing an insurrection ban.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, on the other hand, stressed the idea that the ban only applies to serving in office – not necessarily running for office.

The amendment’s key provision, Section 3, says in part: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Steve Womack Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

House Republicans were exasperated after the stunning defeat of their resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, lobbing some criticism at their own leadership over the fiasco even as they plan to bring the vote back up again when they have better attendance.

GOP Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said it was unwise of leadership to put the bill on the floor not knowing for sure whether it would pass, adding to the perception that House Republicans can’t govern.

“It's hard to sit there and see it, you know, I mean, it's tough. We're in a difficult spot right now,” he said. “If we whipped, we need a better whip. I'm not talking about the person in the job. I'm just saying the whip count. We need to know exactly where we are and we need to be careful not to get out ahead of our skis and put something on the floor that we don't have certainty on.”

Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina also criticized GOP leadership’s strategy on the Mayorkas vote.

“I would have thought they would have known that. I would have thought that would have been basic,” Norman said of the whip count. “They’re good on the other side of knowing that. Is it that hard?”

“But it did happen, it went down, and we live to fight another day,” he said.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene disputed that it was a miscalculation to put the bill on the floor, telling CNN, ""I don’t think it’s a failure at all,"" and warning that the Republicans who voted to sink the impeachment articles would be hearing from voters.

“I’m sure they’ll hear from their constituents. I’m sure they’re probably hearing from them already, but I think they should listen to them,"" the Georgia Republican said.

“I look forward to having Steve Scalise back. Of course, been praying for him this whole time to beat cancer,” she added, referring to the House majority leader who was absent from the vote as he recovers in Louisiana from a stem cell transplant.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Eduardo Munoz/Reuters/FILE

After turning several recent trials and court hearings into campaign stops, Donald Trump is not expected to be in the room when the highest court in the land takes up the question of his ballot eligibility, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN.

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

While many legal experts believe Trump could prevail on the ballot challenges issue, his appearance could be considered disruptive to the normally staid and above-the-fray decorum of the Supreme Court.

Trump and his team have treated various court appearances as opportunities for him to cry “election interference,” call out who he deems “Trump-hating” judges and attack the system as rigged “political persecution.” His presence and the attendant

Since the Supreme Court first convened in 1790, 116 justices have served on the bench. Of those, 108 have been White men.

But in recent decades the court has become more diverse. Over half of its appointed justices since 1990 have been women or minorities.

The two most recently appointed justices were women, and one a woman of color. Ketanji Brown Jackson, previously a federal appeals court judge, in 2022 became the first Black woman on the high court. She succeeded Stephen Breyer, who is White.

And Amy Coney Barrett, also previously a federal appeals court judge, was chosen by Donald Trump to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020.

Here’s how the demographics of the nation’s highest court have stacked up since its beginning.

Four have been people of color

Only three African American justices, Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson have served on the court.

The first appointment – when Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Marshall – was in 1967. When Johnson announced the nomination, he said he thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it.

Thomas’s appointment happened decades later, in 1991 under George H.W. Bush.

Jackson became the court’s third Black justice in 2022 after being nominated by Joe Biden.

Sonia Sotomayor is the first and only Hispanic justice in history. (Some say Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was Portuguese, was the first Hispanic member, but he doesn’t qualify under current Census standards.) She was nominated by Barack Obama in 2009.

No justices so far have identified as Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander.

And no women or people of color have served as chief justices of the nation’s highest court.

Six have been women

Of the 116 justices in history, 110 – or 94.8% – have been men. Until 1981, every Supreme Court justice was male. But Ronald Reagan promised he’d put a woman on the court, and during his first year in office he kept that promise by appointing Sandra Day O’Connor.

Before that, presidents had appointed women to lower courts. While Harry Truman, who was president from 1945-1953, thought about nominating a woman to the high court, sitting justices at the time said women “would inhibit their conference deliberations.”

Bill Clinton made the second appointment of a woman to the high court by nominating Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993.

And Barack Obama appointed two women, the aforementioned Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, whom he appointed in 2010.

Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett and Jackson all sit on the current court.

Eight have been Jewish

At its founding, the court was made up almost entirely of Protestant members, and a majority of the 116 justices throughout history have been Protestants.

The court today is more diverse. There are currently six Catholic justices, not including Neil Gorsuch — nominated by Trump in 2017 — who was raised Catholic but has more recently worshiped at an Episcopal church.

The US has never had a Jewish president, but eight Jewish justices have sat on the bench, including Kagan who currently sits on the bench.

There has never been a Muslim or Hindu justice on the Supreme Court.

Ivy League graduates dominate in recent decades

While the educational law background of many Supreme Court justices’ has varied in past centuries, modern history has been less so. Of the 60 justices confirmed between 1902 and 2022, 15 graduated from Harvard, seven from Yale and four from Columbia law schools.

On today’s court, all but one — Barrett, who attended Notre Dame Law School — hail from Yale or Harvard. The four Yale graduates are Brett Kavanaugh, Sotomayor, Thomas and Samuel Alito, and the four Harvard graduates are Gorsuch, Kagan, Jackson and Chief Justice John Roberts.

Since Oliver Wendell Holmes’ appointment in 1902, the Supreme Court has maintained at least one Harvard law graduate, and it has usually had multiple graduates.

Yale Law School did not have a graduate on the court until Potter Stewart’s confirmation in 1958.

Why diversity matters

The Supreme Court has ruled on a diverse set of topics and sees a wide array of cases.

It’s laid out decisions that affect many segments of the nation’s population, like whether schools should be segregated, whether women can get abortions and if public accommodations can refuse services based on religious beliefs.

The court has heard cases that none of its members can directly relate to. Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was decided by nine justices, none of whom have identified as gay. No past or present justices have publicly identified themselves as anything other than straight.

In 2016, Sotomayor said the court could use more diversity.

“A different perspective can permit you to more fully understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand,” she said.

Ahead of Tuesday's Nevada primary, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s campaign outlined their reasoning behind participating in the state’s primary election instead of the party-run GOP caucuses on Thursday.

“We have not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada. We aren't going to pay $55,000 to a Trump entity to participate in a process that is rigged for Trump. Nevada is not and has never been our focus. I’m truly not sure what the Trump team is up to out there, but they seem pretty spun up about it,” Haley’s campaign manager Betsy Ankney said during a press call on Monday.

More on the dueling GOP contests: While there will be a GOP primary Tuesday, Republicans have chosen to award their delegates via the caucuses, and the dueling contests have caused some confusion among Nevada voters.

Some Republican presidential contenders, including Haley, filed to run in the primary. Former President Donald Trump chose not to appear on the primary ballot, opting instead to appear on the GOP caucus ballot, which effectively guarantees his victory.

Haley has been focusing on her home state of South Carolina ahead of the GOP primary contest on February 24.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

They were talking about Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies extremism. He testified in November in Denver District Court about Trump’s history of embracing of far-right extremists how those militant groups interpreted his incendiary rhetoric on the morning of January 6, immediately proceeding the violent storming of the US Capitol.

Peter Simi testifies during a hearing for a lawsuit to keep former President Donald Trump off the Colorado state ballot in Denver in October 2023. Jack Dempsey/Pool via AP

Simi’s testimony ended up being influential to the Colorado Supreme Court’s eventual decision to bar Trump from the ballot. But Alito pressed lawyer Jason Murray on whether other states might draw different conclusions, if they were to vet Trump’s actions on January 6. He suggested that other states might not even consider Simi as an expert.

The questioning was yet another example of how the justices appear to be skeptical of the effort to bar Trump from the ballot.

Here’s CNN’s coverage from when Simi testified at the trial:

Trump was often “using language with a wink and a nod,” Simi said, but members of these extremist groups consistently interpreted his comments as a “clarion call” toward “anger, resentment and mobilization.” This ramped up in summer 2020 as Trump began claiming he was being cheated in the presidential election, Simi said.

Eric Olson, an attorney for the Colorado challengers, played clips from Trump’s January 6 speech, where he urged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” so they could “save” the country (Though, at times, he also said they should do so peacefully.)

Right-wing extremists understood those words as “a call to violence,” Simi testified.

""Within far-right extremist culture, fighting is meant to be taken literally … especially within the context as it’s laid out, that these threats are imminent, and that you’re going to lose your country. Then, fighting would be understood as requiring violent action.”

The relationship between Trump and far-right extremists is “unprecedented,” Simi said.

“Far-right extremists really were galvanized by his candidacy starting in 2015,” Simi said. “And a relationship really emerged between Donald Trump and far-right extremists, with far-right extremists really seeing him as speaking their language, and really addressing many of their key grievances.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Justice Brett Kavanaugh tossed an important question to Trump’s attorney about a 19th century decision dealing with the same issue the court is wrestling with now.

Known as “Griffin’s case,” the 1869 decision found that the insurrection ban could not be enforced without some action first from Congress. The opinion was written by Chief Justice Salmon Chase. It was not a Supreme Court decision but it’s one of the closest things the Supreme Court has to a precedent.

By asking the question, Kavanaugh – often a key swing vote — seems to be signaling an interest in siding with Trump in a narrow way: By ruling that the insurrection ban at issue cannot be enforced with a law enacted by Congress.

“Don’t you think Griffin’s case” is important in “trying to figure out what the original meaning” of the insurrection ban is, Kavanaugh asked.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Leah Millis/Reuters

South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects.

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.

3, 2023 Latest on the new Congress and House speaker vote  CNN","A look inside the House chamber in February. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP/File)

The 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.

Rep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.

Republicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.

Here are key things to know about Tuesday’s vote:

How the day will unfold: Congress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, Jan. 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.

Members will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.

Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.

Members can vote for anyone they want: There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.

Both parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead. McCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.

If neither wins a majority, a “floor fight” happens: Lawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected. This is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker. In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.

It doesn’t always require 218 votes: One important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.

Former President Donald Trump will not accept a plea deal in the indictment brought by a Manhattan grand jury but does plan to file “substantial legal challenges” to the indictment, his attorney Joe Tacopina said.

“President Trump will not take a plea deal in this case. It's not gonna happen,” Tacopina said in an interview with NBC News on Friday.

“I don't know if it's gonna make it to trial because we have substantial legal challenges that we have to ... front before we get to that point,” Tacopina said when asked if he expects to take the case to trial.

Trump will “absolutely” voluntarily surrender to Manhattan law enforcement, the defense attorney said, adding the former president is “not going to hole up in Mar-a-Lago.”

Logistics are currently being worked, he said.

Meanwhile, Trump attorney Jim Trusty said Friday he expects that the former president's legal team will file motions to dismiss his indictment before a trial could potentially get underway.

“I would think in very short order, you'll see a motion to dismiss — or several motions to dismiss — talking about this kind of impossible theory of stacking a federal crime into a state misdemeanor, statute of limitations issues and very importantly, the intent to defraud. That's an element of these false record keeping charges. That's just not present here,"" Trusty told CNN This Morning.

The lawyer said he did not know ""about the exact timing"" as there isn't a case number yet but he noted that it will ""be soon.""

""I think this will be something you can expect in days or weeks, not weeks or months,"" he added.

Tacopina told Good Morning America that the former president ""will not be put in handcuffs.""

Responding to CNN reporting that Trump has been charged on more than 30 counts related to business fraud, Tacopina said he does not know the nature of the charges against Trump or how many there are, but added, “If it's correct, it means they've taken each transaction, each check, each payment, each entry and made a separate charge.”

Tacopina said he does not know when the charges will be unsealed but suggested it “might likely be Tuesday.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Arizona's Maricopa County expects to start releasing Friday evening the first results from its outstanding 290,000 mail-in ballots that voters dropped off on Election Day, a top official told CNN late Thursday.

""We should start to see those tomorrow, I believe – we’ll start seeing those come in,"" said Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors.

Maricopa is Arizona's most populous county and it includes the city of Phoenix.

The mail-in ballots dropped off were a record for the county, Gates said. “It’s a lot of ballots that people are trying to process, but we’re going to get through it. We’re going to do it on a timeline that’s frankly consistent with how long it takes us to get this done every two and every four years.”

Gates pushed back on criticism from Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who has been questioning the integrity of the elections and the length of time to get results.

“There’s nothing out of the ordinary; it makes me wonder if Kari Lake has really been following elections in the past in Maricopa County,” he said.

On Thursday, Maricopa County staff verified nearly all of the 290,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day. It updated an additional tranche of just over 78,000 ballots on Thursday night.

The estimated ballots remaining, according to the county, include:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

McHenry signaled the two sides are trading legislative text as they go along instead of just toplines, so they’re not starting from scratch when they go to write the actual bill.

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

The trial has spanned nearly six weeks so far with testimony from a total of 25 witnesses – 24 of which were in person.

Ivanka Trump was the last witness called before the attorney general’s office rested its case. She followed testimony from her father and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric.

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Donald Trump’s worth on financial statements.

The attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

The attorney general is also seeking to ban the Trumps from doing business in New York.

The trial has seen a slew of fireworks, including the judge imposing two fines on Donald Trump totaling $15,000 for violating his gag order forbidding anyone from commenting about his staff. The former president had repeatedly criticized Engoron’s law clerk.

Donald Trump attended court a total of seven days, where he attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, the judge, and the case against him.

He did the same when he took the stand earlier this week with lengthy speeches during his testimony that sparked multiple admonishments from the judge.

Trump’s attorneys are set to begin their defense on Monday and indicated they would finish by mid-December.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The craft, described by US intelligence as a surveillance balloon, presented a comparatively low-tech, modest security threat compared to the multilayered espionage, economic, cyber, military and geopolitical rivalry escalating every day.

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He also offered qualified support for social spending programs to help support newborns and new parents but stopped short of specifically endorsing paid family leave for all Americans or subsidized child care.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

McHenry signaled the two sides are trading legislative text as they go along instead of just toplines, so they’re not starting from scratch when they go to write the actual bill.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images

An apparent backtrack by Donald Trump’s ex-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen threw the New York civil fraud trial into more chaos Wednesday afternoon.

Cohen gave combative testimony in the face of cross-examination to two Trump attorneys on Wednesday, after he had implicated Trump the day prior for directing him to “reverse-engineer” financial statements to increase his net worth.

On Wednesday morning, Trump attorney Alina Habba pressed Cohen about his 2019 congressional testimony when he said, “Not that I recall, no,” in response to a question about whether Trump had directed him or Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to inflate numbers for Trump’s personal statement.

Cohen said to Habba that he was lying in his testimony.

But after lunch, Cliff Robert, another Trump attorney, pressed Cohen further on his congressional testimony, and the former Trump attorney had a different response, saying that the testimony was not false.

“So, Mr. Trump never asked you to inflate the numbers on his financial statement,"" Robert asked.

“Correct,"" Cohen said.

That response prompted Trump’s attorney to ask the first time for a directed verdict to dismiss the trial because Cohen was a key witness in the case.

Engoron denied it, which led to Trump abruptly leaving the courtroom.

The New York attorney general's lawyers asked Cohen in follow up questions to clarify his response. Cohen said that Trump never directly asked to inflate the numbers, but that what he wanted was known, because he spoke like “a mob boss.”

""He tells you what he wants without specifically telling you,"" Cohen said. ""We understood what he wanted.”

At the conclusion of Cohen’s testimony, Robert renewed his request for a verdict to and ""end this case once and for all.""

“Absolutely denied,” Engoron said in response.

The case has evidence, credible or not, “all over the place,” the judge said.

Engoron also said he didn’t consider Cohen to be a “key witness” in the case, in which the New York attorney general accused Trump and his business of fraud in a $250 million suit.

“There’s enough evidence in this case to fill this courtroom,” Engoron said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

The trial has spanned nearly six weeks so far with testimony from a total of 25 witnesses – 24 of which were in person.

Ivanka Trump was the last witness called before the attorney general’s office rested its case. She followed testimony from her father and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric.

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Donald Trump’s worth on financial statements.

The attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

The attorney general is also seeking to ban the Trumps from doing business in New York.

The trial has seen a slew of fireworks, including the judge imposing two fines on Donald Trump totaling $15,000 for violating his gag order forbidding anyone from commenting about his staff. The former president had repeatedly criticized Engoron’s law clerk.

Donald Trump attended court a total of seven days, where he attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, the judge, and the case against him.

He did the same when he took the stand earlier this week with lengthy speeches during his testimony that sparked multiple admonishments from the judge.

Trump’s attorneys are set to begin their defense on Monday and indicated they would finish by mid-December.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The craft, described by US intelligence as a surveillance balloon, presented a comparatively low-tech, modest security threat compared to the multilayered espionage, economic, cyber, military and geopolitical rivalry escalating every day.

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.

Usually incumbent presidents win party primaries in a walk. But due to the Democratic Party's beef with the date of New Hampshire's primary, President Joe Biden isn't even appearing on the ballot in New Hampshire. The Democratic Party is also penalizing New Hampshire by taking away most of its delegates to the national convention.

Even though he's boycotting the ballot, Biden's supporters are still hoping he wins and have organized a campaign to encourage Democratic primary voters to write his name in on the ballot.

You won't usually hear about write-in campaigns because they're usually just about impossible to win. It's the “triple lindy” of American politics.

The most recent, major write-in victory in a nationally important race happened in 2010, when Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, lost her party primary to Joe Miller, who mounted a challenge from the right wing. It was only the second successful Senate write-in campaign.

The late Sen. Strom Thurmond, a seriously controversial figure today, won the first general election write-in campaign back in 1954, riding a wave of frustration after the party anointed a candidate to fill the shoes of the primary winner who had died.

So is a write-in win impossible? No. Is it a frequent occurrence? It is not.

Biden should have an easier time as a write-in candidate than either Murkowski or Thurmond. None of his competition has anywhere close to his name recognition. Plus, the people who show up for a Democratic primary in a year when their party is the incumbent are perhaps more politically attuned than the public at large.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Lucy Luckovich

The all-day hearing on former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’ request to move the Georgia election interference case to federal court in Atlanta has concluded.

US District Judge Steve Jones did not rule from the bench on Monday. He acknowledged that arraignments in the criminal case were scheduled for September 6, and said he would rule as quickly as possible.

Meadows’ attorney said “we are entitled to a prompt determination” of whether his state criminal charges will be moved to federal court.

As the hearing drew to a close, one of the judge’s final questions was whether Meadows had any federal authorities that Trump didn’t have as president. District Attorney Fani Willis’ office said no, but Meadows team said yes, arguing that the chief of staff has a “wide range of authority.”

The breadth of his federal authority is key to determining whether the case will stay in state court.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote to watch in the case, suggested one of the main arguments raised by challengers was “at war” with the history of the insurrection ban at center in the case.

“The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Roberts said. “On the other hand, it augmented federal power.”

Roberts suggested the idea that the amendment would give states power to remove candidates under the provision would be “at war” with the whole thrust and history of the 14th Amendment.

The challengers claimed the 14th Amendment lets states bar insurrectionists from the ballot – which means in simple terms that Congress was providing some very strong powers to the states. But Congress wrote and ratified that amendment during the Reconstruction Era, when they were trying to reign in rogue Southern states after the Civil War and reassert federal powers over civil rights.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Unlike campaign events – which I usually cover – inside the Supreme Court, no electronics are allowed. Just pen and paper.

Even the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

From where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.

While Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.

You cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Mitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply...”

Kagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.

Another moment of laughter surrounded the order of specific questions. Kagan jumped in as Jackson pivoted to another point about the officer/office debate: “Could we — is that OK if we do this and then do that? Will there be an opportunity to do officer stuff or should we–?”

“Absolutely. Absolutely,” Roberts said, diffusing the confusion, as people laughed.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Leah Millis/Reuters

South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects.

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images

Former President Donald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell concluded his initial arguments before the Supreme Court justices after nearly an hour.

Here are some of the key things that happened:

Power of states: Several of the justices from both ideological sides pressed the Trump lawyer about stripping states of their ability to exclude candidates from power, including whether an “admitted insurrectionist” could be removed from the ballot.

Mitchell argued that it was the role of Congress to determine whether someone should be disqualified — so even if a person admits to being an insurrectionist, states have no basis to act. ""Even if the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist, Section 3 (of the 14th Amendment) still allows the candidate to run for office, and even win election for office, and then see whether Congress lifts that disability after the election,"" Mitchell said in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts.

The role of Congress: Mitchell argued that Colorado's decision to remove Trump from the ballot was improper because, among other reasons, the state disqualified Trump before Congress explicitly gave it the power to do that.

The debate over the term ""officer"": The justices pressed Mitchell over whether the framers of the 14th Amendment believed the president is an “officer of” the United States, and therefore subject to the “insurrectionist ban” under Section 3. The argument is a central focus of the former president’s legal team, which believes that when the amendment’s framers wrote “officer,” they meant lower federal officials appointed by the president – not the president himself.

That discussion led to this particularly intense exchange:

“For an insurrection, there needs to be an organized, concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence,” Mitchell said.

“A chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection?” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked.

Mitchell responded: “This was a riot. It was not an insurrection.”

What happens next for Trump's legal team: Mitchell will have an opportunity to make brief rebuttal arguments to the justices at the end of the hearing, after lawyers for the Colorado voters and secretary of state finish presenting their case.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election.

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

Introduces a new process in which US Citizenship and Immigration Services would decide an asylum claim without it going through the immigration court system. The process doesn’t apply to unaccompanied migrant children.

We spoke to Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor and author of the new book, “Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away With It,” for a refresher on how grand juries and indictments work. Part of our conversation, conducted by phone, is below:

Grand jury vs. trial jury

WOLF: What should we know about the difference between a grand jury and a trial jury?

HONIG: A grand jury decides to indict, meaning to charge a case. A trial jury determines guilt or non-guilt.

A grand jury is bigger, typically 23 members, and the prosecutor only needs the votes of a majority of a grand jury — as opposed to a trial jury, which has to be unanimous.

The standard of proof in a grand jury is lower than a trial jury. In a grand jury, you only have to show probable cause, meaning more likely than not. But of course in a trial setting, you need to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The other thing to know is a grand jury is an almost entirely one-sided process.

Usually the only people allowed in the room at all are the grand jurors, the prosecutors, the witnesses and a court reporter.

In some instances, including New York, there’s a limited right of a potential defendant to present some evidence, but no defense lawyers are allowed in the room.

There’s no cross-examination of the prosecution’s evidence. There’s no presentation of defense evidence.

Close to every time a prosecutor seeks an indictment from a grand jury, he or she will get an indictment from the grand jury.

What is an indictment?

WOLF: How would you define “indictment”?

HONIG: It’s a document setting forth formal charges against the defendant.

3 Trump grand juries

WOLF: We have three grand juries that are top of mind — for election meddling in Georgia, at the federal level for declassified documents and then the Manhattan DA. How much variation is there in grand juries between city, county and federal?

HONIG: There are minor variations, but the basics remain the same.

Here’s an example of one of the minor variations in New York State, but not in the federal system, meaning for DOJ. The defendant does have some limited right to be notified and given a chance to testify or present defense evidence, which we saw play out with Trump and then him asking Robert Costello to testify.

That’s not the case federally. You do not have to give a defendant a chance to testify or present evidence. That’s one slight variation. But the basic fundamentals are the same.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday defended her decision to stay in the GOP primary race as her opponent Donald Trump is again expected to win in Michigan.

""We've only seen a handful of states vote. I mean, look, I've said this before as much as the media wants to jump ahead, we're taking this one state, one day at a time,"" she told CNN's Dana Bash.

Trump beat Haley by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands – and most notably last week in Haley's home state of of South Carolina where voters had elected her twice as their governor.

""America is blessed to be a democracy let people vote. Now in the next week, we're going to watch 20 states and territories vote,"" Haley said, referring to Super Tuesday on March 5. ""Let's let that happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 1,508 interviews with Republican primary voters across 38 different polling places on Election Day.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

As the evidentiary hearing got under way, an attorney for the Fulton County district attorney’s office told the judge that the entire motion over whether District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified ought to be dismissed.

Adam Abbate told the judge: “We’ve been able to determine that the claims the defendant has … are not only legally meritless” but are also “patiently false.”

The judge, Scott McAfee, denied Abbate’s renewed effort to stop the hearing.

Abbate argued that the testimony of one of the key witnesses in the case, Terrence Bradley, would be blocked by attorney-client privilege. Bradley represented Nathan Wade in his divorce proceedings. In this hearing, McAfee will consider allegations that Willis and Wade, he top prosecutor, engaged in a romantic relationship.

“We’d ask to renew our motion to quash,” Abbate said.

Brendan McDermid/Pool via Reuters

Before entering the courtroom in New York on Thursday morning, Trump claimed the hush money case against him is “election interference.” He also argued that it is interfering with his ability to campaign in South Carolina ahead of the February 24 Republican presidential primary there.

“How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again — this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said.

Trump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in South Carolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.”

Facts First: Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in New York on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances.

Rather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a hearing related to charges he faces in Georgia.

And he had not been scheduled to be in South Carolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the New York hearing. His next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week. His next rally after the Thursday hearing is a Saturday event in Michigan.

John Floyd, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ father, testified Friday that he taught his daughter to “hide cash” in case she needed it.

“What I told my child from the time she was a child was always have some money,” Floyd said, adding that he told her to always have “six months of cash always.”

Defense attorneys had pushed Willis over why she would keep a prevalence of cash in her home, which she said used to pay Nathan Wade back for various expenses. Floyd’s testimony corroborates Willis’ statements that she was taught to always have cash handy.

“Maybe, and excuse me your honor, I’m not trying to be racist, but it’s a black thing,” Floyd said. “I was trained, and most black folks, they hide cash or they keep cash, and I was trained you always keep some cash.”

“I gave my daughter her first cash box and told her, ‘always keep some cash,’” Floyd said.

Floyd referenced a time he had trouble paying for his meal at a restaurant several years ago to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“I had a American Express credit card and maybe a Visa,” Floyd said, as well as “a lot of what they call traveler’s checks.”

“For whatever reasons the man would not take my American Express credit card,” Floyd said. “So, I pulled out my Visa card, and he wouldn’t take my Visa card. So then I pulled out my traveler’s checks, and he said ‘we don’t take checks.’""

“The bill for my wife at the time … Fani and myself was like $9.95, I had a $10 bill. And I always remember that,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 1,508 interviews with Republican primary voters across 38 different polling places on Election Day. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Junfu Han/Detroit Free Press/USA Today Network

A Michigan court has affirmed the removal of Kristina Karamo as the state’s Republican Party chair, in a move that could settle a bitter leadership dispute just days before the party’s convention this weekend.

In a preliminary injunction issued Tuesday, Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi said Karamo was properly removed from her position on January 6, when Michigan’s GOP state committee voted to oust her, and that any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.”

Tuesday’s ruling, a copy of which was published by NBC News, also prevents Karamo from representing herself as chair of the Michigan Republican State Committee or conducting business on behalf of the party.

Tuesday’s development was a victory for Pete Hoekstra, a former ambassador and representative who has been recognized by the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump as the rightful chair of the Michigan Republican Party.

The Michigan GOP is set to hold its convention on Saturday, when it will allocate the state’s delegates for the Republican National Convention. Karamo had planned a rival convention, potentially complicating the process.

CNN previously reported that under Karamo’s leadership, the Michigan GOP suffered from internal strife and lackluster finances. A CNN investigation published in late 2023 found the party’s financial problems had become so bad that an internal report revealed the state party had a net income of just $71,000 over a nine-month period that ended with it $600,000 in debt.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The rest will be awarded at a state party convention Saturday. Former President Donald Trump defeated GOP rival Nikki Haley in the primary.

The split contests are the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in their new lineup.

Republicans opposed an earlier Michigan primary, which violated Republican National Committee rules limiting which states can hold contests before March 1. After Democrats, who control the legislature and the governor’s office, moved the Michigan primary to February 27 despite the Republican opposition, the RNC and the Michigan GOP came up with the hybrid model.

Further complicating matters: The Michigan GOP is in the middle of a battle over who actually leads the party, with two people who claim to be the party’s leaders scheduling dueling conventions Saturday. The RNC and Trump have recognized Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman and US ambassador to the Netherlands, as chair; Hoekstra scheduled a Saturday convention in Grand Rapids. However, Kristina Karamo, the election conspiracy theorist who the state party voted to oust in January, has refused to relinquish control, arguing she was unlawfully removed. She has planned a convention in Detroit.

Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi on Tuesday affirmed Karamo’s removal as state party chair, saying any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.” She has not yet said whether the convention she planned for Detroit would go forward. Regardless of Karamo’s actions, the RNC’s decision to recognize Hoekstra signaled the party would accept delegates from the convention he will oversee.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Blumenthal says  CNN","Sen. Richard Blumenthal speaks to reporters in the Capitol on Tuesday. CNN

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal dismissed concerns over the potential weakness of President Joe Biden’s electoral coalition — which has faced challenges amid concerns from Arab Americans and progressives over the administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

""I think the Biden coalition is strong, alive and well and focused on the basic accomplishments of this administration, as it will be on election day. I am very, very hopeful that a pause can diminish some of the apparent friction involved in that coalition, but I think it will hold together,"" the senator from Connecticut told CNN.

His comments come ahead of today’s Democratic primary in Michigan where there has been an organized effort, including by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian American, to send a message to the Biden campaign by urging voters to vote ""uncommitted.""

Blumenthal’s emphasis on a potential pause in the fighting in Gaza, which Biden said could possibly be reached as early as the end of this upcoming weekend, illustrates the ongoing political ramifications of the war.

Chris Carlson/AP

There was a muted response in the room of Nikki Haley’s campaign party when CNN projected that Donald Trump would win the South Carolina primary — until the former president started speaking.

A man started waving a South Carolina loves Nikki Haley sign in front of the projection of Trump speaking, and moments later chants for Haley broke out.

“I don’t think it is over,” Nell Parker, a Haley supporter in the room told CNN. Parker said she plans to rally North Carolina for Haley, and feels good about her odds going forward.

“We are for anyone against Trump,” said another Haley supporter in the room.

Others said they did not trust the projection, and were frustrated about polls generally.

No one in the room said they believe this is the beginning of the end for Haley.

The Haley campaign say they feel that they did everything they could to effectively compete in South Carolina, but aides said frustrations arose throughout the last month given the strong hold that Trump has on the state. For example, the Republican group at Clemson University endorsed Trump, which was frustrating for Haley’s team given the school is her alma mater.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alabas Farhat. From Michigan House Democrats

Michigan state Rep. Alabas Farhat is voting ""uncommitted"" in today's primary to send a message to President Joe Biden to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and urge him to live up to his campaign promises from 2020.

""I want to make it clear that today's vote is an appeal to the White House, it is an appeal to President Biden to be the leader that we know he can, a leader that he promised the nation he would be in 2020, when he campaigned saying that he was going to restore dignity and humanity to the White House,"" the Democratic representative from Michigan's 3rd District told CNN.

Farhat said that there are thousands of Michiganders who are watching the atrocities overseas with horror and anguish. They're watching ""their loved ones dying, children starving to death and they're hearing the screams of parents who are holding their children, their lifeless children,"" he said. He said the coalition wants to see an effort toward restoring humanitarian aid and lasting peace.

Farhat added that the push to vote uncommitted during the primary will probably not impact Biden winning, but those involved are building a diverse coalition to show the White House that there is a unified message calling for a ceasefire.

""The message though is that a plurality of voters, Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Gen Z voters are coming together — African American voters are coming together in a coalition to tell the president that, 'Hey, we want — we want to see you call for the ceasefire. We want to see our White House reflect the values that we know it should reflect,'"" Farhat said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9. The trial is currently set to start in May.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Two of the Big Three companies, GM and Chrysler, went bankrupt in 2009 and needed federal bailouts to survive.

That took a bite not only out of employment, but out of auto wages, as the United Auto Workers union agreed to deep concessions, including a lower tier of wages, to help keep all three companies alive. But that helped drag down wages in the state overall.

The state’s median household income was higher than the national average until 2000, according to the Growing Michigan Together Council, a group formed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to develop solutions to Michigan’s challenges. The state’s median income declined relative to the US level over the past five decades.

Today, the median household income in the state was just under $67,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau.

However, following a six-week strike last fall at GM, Ford and Stellantis, the United Auto Workers union won immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members. Pay for members is expected to rise more than 30% during the life of the contract, which expires in 2028.

While jobs in the state’s auto and parts plants have stabilized in recent years, jobs in the manufacturing sector overall have edged up by 4.5% since the end of 2020. But that still hasn’t recaptured jobs lost in that sector during the first year of the pandemic. Overall employment in the state in December was up 9.6% from the end of 2020, but still off 0.5% from December of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic.

Rebecca Cook/Reuters

President Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win tonight’s Democratic primary in Michigan. But that hasn’t stopped those who believe he should be pushing harder for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas from organizing a vote for “uncommitted.”

That is, a vote in the primary for “uncommitted” is a protest vote against Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza. It’s not clear how well this effort will do, but a high percentage of support could suggest general election trouble for Biden in the Wolverine State.

Take a look at the 2020 Republican presidential primaries: President Donald Trump romped to wins everywhere with 94% of the vote nationally, but his weakest region (or census subdivision) by far was New England. He was under 90% of the primary vote in all those states and even came in with less than 80% in Connecticut. In the general election, all the New England states swung against Trump by about 2 to 4 times as much as the swing against him nationally compared with 2016.

In the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, we saw a somewhat similar phenomenon. President Barack Obama won about 90% of the vote nationally. He got below 60% of the primary vote in a line of states from Oklahoma to Arkansas to Kentucky to West Virginia.

All four were among the six states that swung the most toward the Republican candidate on the presidential level from 2004 to 2012.

It’s not exactly clear what a low level of support tonight for Biden would be. Still, he got over 95% of the vote in South Carolina and nearly 90% in Nevada. If he falls significantly short of those levels, it could be ominous.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA/AP

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of House progressives, said the number of ""uncommitted"" votes in Michigan is a major warning sign for President Joe Biden in November.

“This is exactly what I warned about several months ago,” Jayapal told CNN. “The war on Gaza is a deep moral issue and the lack of attention and empathy for this perspective from the administration is breaking apart the fragile coalition we built to elect Joe Biden in 2020.”

Jayapal says there is “still a little bit of time to change this dynamic.” But she added: “It has to be a dramatic policy and rhetorical shift from the president on this issue and a new strategy to rebuild a real partnership with progressives in multiple communities who are absolutely key to winning the election.”

Organizers of the movement to vote ""uncommitted"" had hoped at least 10,000 people would cast their vote for the cause, a nod to the 10,700-vote margin that delivered the state to Donald Trump in 2016. They had far surpassed that goal just before 11 p.m. Tuesday night.

One of the leading voices in the campaign to vote “uncommitted,” former Democratic US Rep. Andy Levin, said the early numbers show a “historic” result. He said he felt the effort was a success in conveying people's anger to the president.

Levin’s message to voters who are mad about the war in Gaza was: “Don't stay home, don't stay home. Go out and shake your fist. Go to the ballot box and tell the president you're mad otherwise, he won’t know.”

Two of the Big Three companies, GM and Chrysler, went bankrupt in 2009 and needed federal bailouts to survive.

That took a bite not only out of employment, but out of auto wages, as the United Auto Workers union agreed to deep concessions, including a lower tier of wages, to help keep all three companies alive. But that helped drag down wages in the state overall.

The state’s median household income was higher than the national average until 2000, according to the Growing Michigan Together Council, a group formed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to develop solutions to Michigan’s challenges. The state’s median income declined relative to the US level over the past five decades.

Today, the median household income in the state was just under $67,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau.

However, following a six-week strike last fall at GM, Ford and Stellantis, the United Auto Workers union won immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members. Pay for members is expected to rise more than 30% during the life of the contract, which expires in 2028.

While jobs in the state’s auto and parts plants have stabilized in recent years, jobs in the manufacturing sector overall have edged up by 4.5% since the end of 2020. But that still hasn’t recaptured jobs lost in that sector during the first year of the pandemic. Overall employment in the state in December was up 9.6% from the end of 2020, but still off 0.5% from December of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Michigan also faces serious challenges as automakers plan to shift to electric vehicles, or EVs","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to convince Judge Aileen Cannon that she will need to hold a hearing on their request for more discovery from several agencies and the White House.

Their request depends on an argument that officials from those agencies were advising prosecutors on prosecutorial decisions that essentially make them members of the prosecution team.

Cannon seemed open to the idea of holding a hearing, but pressed Trump attorney Emil Bove on what such a hearing would focus on and how it would work. Bove pointed to several examples of what he said was collaboration between multiple government agencies like the National Archives and the White House.

Bove added that a hearing where prosecutors would address some of these arguments would have to take place in a secure location, especially since it would touch on how classified material in the case was reviewed.

Prosecutors denied these claims of inter-agency collaboration earlier in the hearing.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Momentum to plot a swift impeachment of Mayorkas picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republicans expressed openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border.

Border authorities encountered more than 225,000 migrants along the US-Mexico border in December, marking the highest monthly total recorded since 2000, according to preliminary Homeland Security statistics shared with CNN. And in fiscal year 2022, according to the Department of Homeland Security, 1.4 million individuals who were encountered at the border were removed, which is more than in any previous year.

The border crisis has galvanized Republicans, unifying their party for more aggressive action on an issue central to the 2024 campaign, and a handful of the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to scuttle an effort to impeach Mayorkas in November 2023 recently signaled they’d back impeaching him if it went through the committee process, which happened late last month.

Moderate Republicans, including ones in districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020, also signaled more willingness to impeach Mayorkas than the president – a sign of the shifting political terrain on the issue.

While House Republicans have sought to use Mayorkas' impeachment to address their issues with Biden's handling of the border, the GOP also helped to tank – along with Donald Trump – a major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package that would have marked a tough change to immigration law championed by one of the Senate's most conservative members. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber, even if it ever made it out of the Senate.

Mayorkas wrote in a letter in advance of the vote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.”

In 2020, Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American activist and longtime Michigan Democrat, backed Joe Biden for president. But like many Arab Americans, she feels betrayed by his response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the rising civilian death toll. Biden would need to curtail US military aid to Israel and call for a permanent ceasefire before she could even consider supporting him in November, she said.

And as for Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Michigan, she’s leading the charge to convince Democrats to vote “uncommitted.” Elabed is the effort’s campaign manager and the sister of Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman in Congress.

The Listen to Michigan campaign was launched less than three weeks ago by Elabed and other Arab American activists in the Wolverine State. It’s a last-minute effort to send a “clear, sharp message” to Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party to address the concerns of the coalition that helped him win in 2020, Elabed said.

Since its launch, the effort has been endorsed by progressive groups such as Our Revolution and more than three dozen current and former state and local leaders, including Tlaib and former US Rep. Andy Levin. Volunteers have contacted more than 100,000 voters in the state, according to organizers.

The president’s reelection campaign has responded to the Listen to Michigan effort by emphasizing Biden’s domestic accomplishments, framing the general election as a binary choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump and stressing that the administration is listening to people’s concerns and open to future conversations.

Why this matters: If thousands of Michigan Democrats vote uncommitted Tuesday, it would be the clearest sign yet that Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza could cost him critical votes in November. Arab and Muslim Americans make up a substantial voting bloc in Michigan, a key battleground state.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Sen. Gary Peters, the chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm who hails from Michigan, downplayed the progressive-led effort to vote “uncommitted” in Tuesday’s primary as a form of protest over President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

“I'm not sure what we'll see tonight, we'll be watching that number. But it's certainly not unusual for people to vote uncommitted,” Peters told CNN, ticking off the number of uncommitted votes in previous cycles, including when Barack Obama was president and ran unopposed.

Asked if he harbors any concerns about cracks in Biden’s coalition, Peters said: “No, no, I don't see that. But we'll continue to hold that together and continue to be strong. You know, if you look at former President Trump — he has an opponent taking 40% in primaries away from him. To me that's more significant.”

However, others in the party have expressed concern about the organized “uncommitted” effort — led in part by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — even as they say they respect the views of voters and acknowledge it’s imperative for Biden to hear out their concerns in a key battleground state.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the other Michigan senator, said on CNN earlier today she thinks the campaign to urge voters to vote uncommitted is “certainly not helpful.”

And one House Democrat told CNN there is “massive” frustration inside the party over the effort, worried it could backfire if it winds up helping get Trump elected. “The president is weak enough without hobbling him more with a concerted campaign against him,” the lawmaker told CNN.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on February 15, in Atlanta, Georgia Alyssa Pointer/Pool/Getty Images

Several advisers and confidants of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis privately urged her in recent weeks to encourage top prosecutor Nathan Wade voluntarily step aside, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.

Willis is being advised by people inside and outside of the district attorney’s office, though one source said there is a difference of legal opinions about what to do next.

Willis and Wade have so far resisted the push for him to resign from the Georgia election subversion case, a stance that the two reinforced in their defiant testimony Thursday in an Atlanta-area courtroom where they pushed back on allegations that their now-ended romantic relationship created a disqualifying conflict of interest.

CNN previously reported that Willis had no plans to recuse herself from the case after allegations surfaced that she and Wade engaged in an improper romantic relationship. Sources familiar with the situation said prior to Thursday’s hearing that Wade also did not have immediate plans to step away from the case either but acknowledged his future was more uncertain.

Wade is interchangeable and could be replaced without forcing the case to be assigned to another prosecutor's office, multiple sources familiar with the situation stressed before and after he testified on Thursday.

Privately, Wade has told others working on the Georgia election case he does not want to be a distraction, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

It remains unclear if Wade’s testimony has moved the needle at all in terms of the likelihood he resigns. A spokesperson for the district attorney’s office declined to comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Trump, who is facing charges related to mishandling of classified documents, called it a ""sick and corrupt two-tiered system of justice.""

In a report released Thursday, Special Counsel Robert Hur did not recommend charges against Biden over his handling of classified documents. In his explanation for not recommending prosecution, Hur described the president as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”

Trump, addressing a National Rifle Association rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said Biden did ""a lot"" of the activity related to retaining documents ""when he was at a very young age.""

""He was mentally a little better than he is right now,"" he continued, addressing Biden's mental acuity, something he did not immediately seize on yesterday in the wake of the report.

The former president also said Biden had made recovery of classified documents by investigators ""almost impossible,"" later claiming that he cooperated with investigators more than Biden did.

However, Hur made clear in his report how different Biden's and Trump’s classified information cases are — namely, that Biden cooperated with investigators while Trump did not.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Evan Vucci/AP

On any other week, special counsel Robert Hur's writing that President Joe Biden could be perceived as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" would have been a damning portrait of a sitting president.

For Biden, however, the special counsel's comments about his memory came at an even more inopportune moment. On three separate occasions this week, Biden has confused the names of European leaders who died years ago with those who more recently served in office, raising more questions about his mental recall.

In those episodes, Biden was describing an international summit in 2021. He described speaking with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, and French President Francois Mitterrand, who died in 1996.

Only about 45 minutes before the report was released publicly, the White House was working to downplay to slip-ups, saying it’s common for people to misspeak.

“Many people, elected officials…they can misspeak sometimes,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, citing recent examples from House Speaker Mike Johnson and TV host Sean Hannity.

She said in meetings, she had never witnessed Biden confuse names.

Yet the picture Hur painted of Biden in the report went well beyond the occasional mistaken name. He said in interviews, the president did not remember the years he was vice president or when his son Beau died.

Immediately after the report was released, White House officials and Biden's personal lawyer forcefully rejected what they said were inappropriate and incorrect statements about his memory.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Norma Anderson, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to disqualify Donald Trump from office, is a lifelong Republican who has had a storied political career, including stints as the first-ever woman majority leader in both chambers of the Colorado legislature.

“I’m an old-fashioned Republican that believes in strong defense, supporting business, and helping those who don’t know how to help themselves, and less government, and a fair tax base,” Anderson said.

Here are some highlights of her career:

She spent 12 years in the statehouse , before having to leave due to term limits. While there, from 1997 to 1998, she was the majority leader of the lower chamber. After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003.

After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003. Her record: While serving in the Colorado statehouse, Anderson helped enact legislation to improve child literacy and lower the cost of in-state colleges and established a home nursing program with funds from a landmark lawsuit against the large tobacco companies.

Battling Trump – especially in court – comes with acclaim in some circles, and vitriol in others. Anderson said she has received a lot of support from friends and family, except for one or two holdouts who are still die-hard Trump supporters. She said most of her friends weren’t surprised that she got involved in the case.

Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

A federal appeals court on Tuesday said that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency, flatly rejecting Trump’s arguments that he shouldn’t have to go on trial on federal election subversion charges.

Here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's decision:

Trump’s behavior after the 2020 election could be criminal: The judges made it clear that Trump's actions could be prosecuted in a court of law.

""Vital public interest"" of letting trial proceed weighed heavily on the court: The judges cited the public interest in accountability for potential crimes committed by a former president, and how that overcame Trump’s argument that immunity was necessary to protect the institution of the presidency. They flatly rejected Trump’s claim that his criminal indictment would have a “chilling effect” on future administrations.

Trial timing will be up to the Supreme Court: A key part of Trump’s legal strategy has been to delay his criminal cases until after the 2024 election. Now, the trial's timing will be in the hands of the Supreme Court. If Trump is successful with getting the Supreme Court to hear the appeal, the criminal trial would not resume until after the high court decides what to do with his request for a pause.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Evelyn Hockstein/Re

The Supreme Court appears poised to back former President Donald Trump and fend off a blockbuster challenge to his eligibility to appear on Colorado’s ballot as a presidential candidate in 2024, a move that would extract the justices from one of the most politically fraught appeals in the court’s history.

If Trump is pulled off the ballot in Colorado, Chief Justice John Roberts predicted that other states would eventually attempt to knock other candidates off the ballot. That, he signaled, would be inconsistent with the purpose and history of the 14th Amendment.

“It’ll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,” Roberts said. “That’s a pretty daunting consequence.”

At issue is a provision in the 14th Amendment that bars certain public officials from serving in the government again if they took part in an insurrection. The six Republican and independent voters from Colorado who challenged Trump say his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol makes him ineligible under that “insurrection ban.”

A majority of the conservative justices on the court posed tough questions to the lawyers representing the voters -- including whether the insurrection ban can be enforced without a law first passed by Congress – though it was unclear which route the court might take.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed the attorneys about a 19th century decision from a lower court that suggested it was congress, not states, that must act first on enforcing an insurrection ban.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, on the other hand, stressed the idea that the ban only applies to serving in office – not necessarily running for office.

The amendment’s key provision, Section 3, says in part: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Steve Womack Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

House Republicans were exasperated after the stunning defeat of their resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, lobbing some criticism at their own leadership over the fiasco even as they plan to bring the vote back up again when they have better attendance.

GOP Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said it was unwise of leadership to put the bill on the floor not knowing for sure whether it would pass, adding to the perception that House Republicans can’t govern.

“It's hard to sit there and see it, you know, I mean, it's tough. We're in a difficult spot right now,” he said. “If we whipped, we need a better whip. I'm not talking about the person in the job. I'm just saying the whip count. We need to know exactly where we are and we need to be careful not to get out ahead of our skis and put something on the floor that we don't have certainty on.”

Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina also criticized GOP leadership’s strategy on the Mayorkas vote.

“I would have thought they would have known that. I would have thought that would have been basic,” Norman said of the whip count. “They’re good on the other side of knowing that. Is it that hard?”

“But it did happen, it went down, and we live to fight another day,” he said.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene disputed that it was a miscalculation to put the bill on the floor, telling CNN, ""I don’t think it’s a failure at all,"" and warning that the Republicans who voted to sink the impeachment articles would be hearing from voters.

“I’m sure they’ll hear from their constituents. I’m sure they’re probably hearing from them already, but I think they should listen to them,"" the Georgia Republican said.

“I look forward to having Steve Scalise back. Of course, been praying for him this whole time to beat cancer,” she added, referring to the House majority leader who was absent from the vote as he recovers in Louisiana from a stem cell transplant.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Eduardo Munoz/Reuters/FILE

After turning several recent trials and court hearings into campaign stops, Donald Trump is not expected to be in the room when the highest court in the land takes up the question of his ballot eligibility, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN.

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

While many legal experts believe Trump could prevail on the ballot challenges issue, his appearance could be considered disruptive to the normally staid and above-the-fray decorum of the Supreme Court.

Trump and his team have treated various court appearances as opportunities for him to cry “election interference,” call out who he deems “Trump-hating” judges and attack the system as rigged “political persecution.” His presence and the attendant

Since the Supreme Court first convened in 1790, 116 justices have served on the bench. Of those, 108 have been White men.

But in recent decades the court has become more diverse. Over half of its appointed justices since 1990 have been women or minorities.

The two most recently appointed justices were women, and one a woman of color. Ketanji Brown Jackson, previously a federal appeals court judge, in 2022 became the first Black woman on the high court. She succeeded Stephen Breyer, who is White.

And Amy Coney Barrett, also previously a federal appeals court judge, was chosen by Donald Trump to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020.

Here’s how the demographics of the nation’s highest court have stacked up since its beginning.

Four have been people of color

Only three African American justices, Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson have served on the court.

The first appointment – when Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Marshall – was in 1967. When Johnson announced the nomination, he said he thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it.

Thomas’s appointment happened decades later, in 1991 under George H.W. Bush.

Jackson became the court’s third Black justice in 2022 after being nominated by Joe Biden.

Sonia Sotomayor is the first and only Hispanic justice in history. (Some say Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was Portuguese, was the first Hispanic member, but he doesn’t qualify under current Census standards.) She was nominated by Barack Obama in 2009.

No justices so far have identified as Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander.

And no women or people of color have served as chief justices of the nation’s highest court.

Six have been women

Of the 116 justices in history, 110 – or 94.8% – have been men. Until 1981, every Supreme Court justice was male. But Ronald Reagan promised he’d put a woman on the court, and during his first year in office he kept that promise by appointing Sandra Day O’Connor.

Before that, presidents had appointed women to lower courts. While Harry Truman, who was president from 1945-1953, thought about nominating a woman to the high court, sitting justices at the time said women “would inhibit their conference deliberations.”

Bill Clinton made the second appointment of a woman to the high court by nominating Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993.

And Barack Obama appointed two women, the aforementioned Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, whom he appointed in 2010.

Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett and Jackson all sit on the current court.

Eight have been Jewish

At its founding, the court was made up almost entirely of Protestant members, and a majority of the 116 justices throughout history have been Protestants.

The court today is more diverse. There are currently six Catholic justices, not including Neil Gorsuch — nominated by Trump in 2017 — who was raised Catholic but has more recently worshiped at an Episcopal church.

The US has never had a Jewish president, but eight Jewish justices have sat on the bench, including Kagan who currently sits on the bench.

There has never been a Muslim or Hindu justice on the Supreme Court.

Ivy League graduates dominate in recent decades

While the educational law background of many Supreme Court justices’ has varied in past centuries, modern history has been less so. Of the 60 justices confirmed between 1902 and 2022, 15 graduated from Harvard, seven from Yale and four from Columbia law schools.

On today’s court, all but one — Barrett, who attended Notre Dame Law School — hail from Yale or Harvard. The four Yale graduates are Brett Kavanaugh, Sotomayor, Thomas and Samuel Alito, and the four Harvard graduates are Gorsuch, Kagan, Jackson and Chief Justice John Roberts.

Since Oliver Wendell Holmes’ appointment in 1902, the Supreme Court has maintained at least one Harvard law graduate, and it has usually had multiple graduates.

Yale Law School did not have a graduate on the court until Potter Stewart’s confirmation in 1958.

Why diversity matters

The Supreme Court has ruled on a diverse set of topics and sees a wide array of cases.

It’s laid out decisions that affect many segments of the nation’s population, like whether schools should be segregated, whether women can get abortions and if public accommodations can refuse services based on religious beliefs.

The court has heard cases that none of its members can directly relate to. Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was decided by nine justices, none of whom have identified as gay. No past or present justices have publicly identified themselves as anything other than straight.

In 2016, Sotomayor said the court could use more diversity.

“A different perspective can permit you to more fully understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand,” she said.

Ahead of Tuesday's Nevada primary, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s campaign outlined their reasoning behind participating in the state’s primary election instead of the party-run GOP caucuses on Thursday.

“We have not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada. We aren't going to pay $55,000 to a Trump entity to participate in a process that is rigged for Trump. Nevada is not and has never been our focus. I’m truly not sure what the Trump team is up to out there, but they seem pretty spun up about it,” Haley’s campaign manager Betsy Ankney said during a press call on Monday.

More on the dueling GOP contests: While there will be a GOP primary Tuesday, Republicans have chosen to award their delegates via the caucuses, and the dueling contests have caused some confusion among Nevada voters.

Some Republican presidential contenders, including Haley, filed to run in the primary. Former President Donald Trump chose not to appear on the primary ballot, opting instead to appear on the GOP caucus ballot, which effectively guarantees his victory.

Haley has been focusing on her home state of South Carolina ahead of the GOP primary contest on February 24.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

They were talking about Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies extremism. He testified in November in Denver District Court about Trump’s history of embracing of far-right extremists how those militant groups interpreted his incendiary rhetoric on the morning of January 6, immediately proceeding the violent storming of the US Capitol.

Peter Simi testifies during a hearing for a lawsuit to keep former President Donald Trump off the Colorado state ballot in Denver in October 2023. Jack Dempsey/Pool via AP

Simi’s testimony ended up being influential to the Colorado Supreme Court’s eventual decision to bar Trump from the ballot. But Alito pressed lawyer Jason Murray on whether other states might draw different conclusions, if they were to vet Trump’s actions on January 6. He suggested that other states might not even consider Simi as an expert.

The questioning was yet another example of how the justices appear to be skeptical of the effort to bar Trump from the ballot.

Here’s CNN’s coverage from when Simi testified at the trial:

Trump was often “using language with a wink and a nod,” Simi said, but members of these extremist groups consistently interpreted his comments as a “clarion call” toward “anger, resentment and mobilization.” This ramped up in summer 2020 as Trump began claiming he was being cheated in the presidential election, Simi said.

Eric Olson, an attorney for the Colorado challengers, played clips from Trump’s January 6 speech, where he urged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” so they could “save” the country (Though, at times, he also said they should do so peacefully.)

Right-wing extremists understood those words as “a call to violence,” Simi testified.

""Within far-right extremist culture, fighting is meant to be taken literally … especially within the context as it’s laid out, that these threats are imminent, and that you’re going to lose your country. Then, fighting would be understood as requiring violent action.”

The relationship between Trump and far-right extremists is “unprecedented,” Simi said.

“Far-right extremists really were galvanized by his candidacy starting in 2015,” Simi said. “And a relationship really emerged between Donald Trump and far-right extremists, with far-right extremists really seeing him as speaking their language, and really addressing many of their key grievances.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Justice Brett Kavanaugh tossed an important question to Trump’s attorney about a 19th century decision dealing with the same issue the court is wrestling with now.

Known as “Griffin’s case,” the 1869 decision found that the insurrection ban could not be enforced without some action first from Congress. The opinion was written by Chief Justice Salmon Chase. It was not a Supreme Court decision but it’s one of the closest things the Supreme Court has to a precedent.

By asking the question, Kavanaugh – often a key swing vote — seems to be signaling an interest in siding with Trump in a narrow way: By ruling that the insurrection ban at issue cannot be enforced with a law enacted by Congress.

“Don’t you think Griffin’s case” is important in “trying to figure out what the original meaning” of the insurrection ban is, Kavanaugh asked.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Leah Millis/Reuters

South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects.

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

Introduces a new process in which US Citizenship and Immigration Services would decide an asylum claim without it going through the immigration court system. The process doesn’t apply to unaccompanied migrant children.

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.

3, 2023 Latest on the new Congress and House speaker vote  CNN","A look inside the House chamber in February. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP/File)

The 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.

Rep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.

Republicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.

Here are key things to know about Tuesday’s vote:

How the day will unfold: Congress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, Jan. 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.

Members will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.

Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.

Members can vote for anyone they want: There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.

Both parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead. McCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.

If neither wins a majority, a “floor fight” happens: Lawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected. This is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker. In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.

It doesn’t always require 218 votes: One important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.

Former President Donald Trump will not accept a plea deal in the indictment brought by a Manhattan grand jury but does plan to file “substantial legal challenges” to the indictment, his attorney Joe Tacopina said.

“President Trump will not take a plea deal in this case. It's not gonna happen,” Tacopina said in an interview with NBC News on Friday.

“I don't know if it's gonna make it to trial because we have substantial legal challenges that we have to ... front before we get to that point,” Tacopina said when asked if he expects to take the case to trial.

Trump will “absolutely” voluntarily surrender to Manhattan law enforcement, the defense attorney said, adding the former president is “not going to hole up in Mar-a-Lago.”

Logistics are currently being worked, he said.

Meanwhile, Trump attorney Jim Trusty said Friday he expects that the former president's legal team will file motions to dismiss his indictment before a trial could potentially get underway.

“I would think in very short order, you'll see a motion to dismiss — or several motions to dismiss — talking about this kind of impossible theory of stacking a federal crime into a state misdemeanor, statute of limitations issues and very importantly, the intent to defraud. That's an element of these false record keeping charges. That's just not present here,"" Trusty told CNN This Morning.

The lawyer said he did not know ""about the exact timing"" as there isn't a case number yet but he noted that it will ""be soon.""

""I think this will be something you can expect in days or weeks, not weeks or months,"" he added.

Tacopina told Good Morning America that the former president ""will not be put in handcuffs.""

Responding to CNN reporting that Trump has been charged on more than 30 counts related to business fraud, Tacopina said he does not know the nature of the charges against Trump or how many there are, but added, “If it's correct, it means they've taken each transaction, each check, each payment, each entry and made a separate charge.”

Tacopina said he does not know when the charges will be unsealed but suggested it “might likely be Tuesday.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Arizona's Maricopa County expects to start releasing Friday evening the first results from its outstanding 290,000 mail-in ballots that voters dropped off on Election Day, a top official told CNN late Thursday.

""We should start to see those tomorrow, I believe – we’ll start seeing those come in,"" said Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors.

Maricopa is Arizona's most populous county and it includes the city of Phoenix.

The mail-in ballots dropped off were a record for the county, Gates said. “It’s a lot of ballots that people are trying to process, but we’re going to get through it. We’re going to do it on a timeline that’s frankly consistent with how long it takes us to get this done every two and every four years.”

Gates pushed back on criticism from Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who has been questioning the integrity of the elections and the length of time to get results.

“There’s nothing out of the ordinary; it makes me wonder if Kari Lake has really been following elections in the past in Maricopa County,” he said.

On Thursday, Maricopa County staff verified nearly all of the 290,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day. It updated an additional tranche of just over 78,000 ballots on Thursday night.

The estimated ballots remaining, according to the county, include:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

The trial has spanned nearly six weeks so far with testimony from a total of 25 witnesses – 24 of which were in person.

Ivanka Trump was the last witness called before the attorney general’s office rested its case. She followed testimony from her father and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric.

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Donald Trump’s worth on financial statements.

The attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

The attorney general is also seeking to ban the Trumps from doing business in New York.

The trial has seen a slew of fireworks, including the judge imposing two fines on Donald Trump totaling $15,000 for violating his gag order forbidding anyone from commenting about his staff. The former president had repeatedly criticized Engoron’s law clerk.

Donald Trump attended court a total of seven days, where he attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, the judge, and the case against him.

He did the same when he took the stand earlier this week with lengthy speeches during his testimony that sparked multiple admonishments from the judge.

Trump’s attorneys are set to begin their defense on Monday and indicated they would finish by mid-December.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The craft, described by US intelligence as a surveillance balloon, presented a comparatively low-tech, modest security threat compared to the multilayered espionage, economic, cyber, military and geopolitical rivalry escalating every day.

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

McHenry signaled the two sides are trading legislative text as they go along instead of just toplines, so they’re not starting from scratch when they go to write the actual bill.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images

An apparent backtrack by Donald Trump’s ex-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen threw the New York civil fraud trial into more chaos Wednesday afternoon.

Cohen gave combative testimony in the face of cross-examination to two Trump attorneys on Wednesday, after he had implicated Trump the day prior for directing him to “reverse-engineer” financial statements to increase his net worth.

On Wednesday morning, Trump attorney Alina Habba pressed Cohen about his 2019 congressional testimony when he said, “Not that I recall, no,” in response to a question about whether Trump had directed him or Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to inflate numbers for Trump’s personal statement.

Cohen said to Habba that he was lying in his testimony.

But after lunch, Cliff Robert, another Trump attorney, pressed Cohen further on his congressional testimony, and the former Trump attorney had a different response, saying that the testimony was not false.

“So, Mr. Trump never asked you to inflate the numbers on his financial statement,"" Robert asked.

“Correct,"" Cohen said.

That response prompted Trump’s attorney to ask the first time for a directed verdict to dismiss the trial because Cohen was a key witness in the case.

Engoron denied it, which led to Trump abruptly leaving the courtroom.

The New York attorney general's lawyers asked Cohen in follow up questions to clarify his response. Cohen said that Trump never directly asked to inflate the numbers, but that what he wanted was known, because he spoke like “a mob boss.”

""He tells you what he wants without specifically telling you,"" Cohen said. ""We understood what he wanted.”

At the conclusion of Cohen’s testimony, Robert renewed his request for a verdict to and ""end this case once and for all.""

“Absolutely denied,” Engoron said in response.

The case has evidence, credible or not, “all over the place,” the judge said.

Engoron also said he didn’t consider Cohen to be a “key witness” in the case, in which the New York attorney general accused Trump and his business of fraud in a $250 million suit.

“There’s enough evidence in this case to fill this courtroom,” Engoron said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

The trial has spanned nearly six weeks so far with testimony from a total of 25 witnesses – 24 of which were in person.

Ivanka Trump was the last witness called before the attorney general’s office rested its case. She followed testimony from her father and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric.

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Donald Trump’s worth on financial statements.

The attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

The attorney general is also seeking to ban the Trumps from doing business in New York.

The trial has seen a slew of fireworks, including the judge imposing two fines on Donald Trump totaling $15,000 for violating his gag order forbidding anyone from commenting about his staff. The former president had repeatedly criticized Engoron’s law clerk.

Donald Trump attended court a total of seven days, where he attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, the judge, and the case against him.

He did the same when he took the stand earlier this week with lengthy speeches during his testimony that sparked multiple admonishments from the judge.

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He also offered qualified support for social spending programs to help support newborns and new parents but stopped short of specifically endorsing paid family leave for all Americans or subsidized child care.

Usually incumbent presidents win party primaries in a walk. But due to the Democratic Party's beef with the date of New Hampshire's primary, President Joe Biden isn't even appearing on the ballot in New Hampshire. The Democratic Party is also penalizing New Hampshire by taking away most of its delegates to the national convention.

Even though he's boycotting the ballot, Biden's supporters are still hoping he wins and have organized a campaign to encourage Democratic primary voters to write his name in on the ballot.

You won't usually hear about write-in campaigns because they're usually just about impossible to win. It's the “triple lindy” of American politics.

The most recent, major write-in victory in a nationally important race happened in 2010, when Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, lost her party primary to Joe Miller, who mounted a challenge from the right wing. It was only the second successful Senate write-in campaign.

The late Sen. Strom Thurmond, a seriously controversial figure today, won the first general election write-in campaign back in 1954, riding a wave of frustration after the party anointed a candidate to fill the shoes of the primary winner who had died.

So is a write-in win impossible? No. Is it a frequent occurrence? It is not.

Biden should have an easier time as a write-in candidate than either Murkowski or Thurmond. None of his competition has anywhere close to his name recognition. Plus, the people who show up for a Democratic primary in a year when their party is the incumbent are perhaps more politically attuned than the public at large.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Lucy Luckovich

The all-day hearing on former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’ request to move the Georgia election interference case to federal court in Atlanta has concluded.

US District Judge Steve Jones did not rule from the bench on Monday. He acknowledged that arraignments in the criminal case were scheduled for September 6, and said he would rule as quickly as possible.

Meadows’ attorney said “we are entitled to a prompt determination” of whether his state criminal charges will be moved to federal court.

As the hearing drew to a close, one of the judge’s final questions was whether Meadows had any federal authorities that Trump didn’t have as president. District Attorney Fani Willis’ office said no, but Meadows team said yes, arguing that the chief of staff has a “wide range of authority.”

The breadth of his federal authority is key to determining whether the case will stay in state court.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters/FILE

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote to watch in the case, suggested one of the main arguments raised by challengers was “at war” with the history of the insurrection ban at center in the case.

“The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Roberts said. “On the other hand, it augmented federal power.”

Roberts suggested the idea that the amendment would give states power to remove candidates under the provision would be “at war” with the whole thrust and history of the 14th Amendment.

The challengers claimed the 14th Amendment lets states bar insurrectionists from the ballot – which means in simple terms that Congress was providing some very strong powers to the states. But Congress wrote and ratified that amendment during the Reconstruction Era, when they were trying to reign in rogue Southern states after the Civil War and reassert federal powers over civil rights.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Unlike campaign events – which I usually cover – inside the Supreme Court, no electronics are allowed. Just pen and paper.

Even the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

From where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.

While Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.

You cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Mitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply...”

Kagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.

Another moment of laughter surrounded the order of specific questions. Kagan jumped in as Jackson pivoted to another point about the officer/office debate: “Could we — is that OK if we do this and then do that? Will there be an opportunity to do officer stuff or should we–?”

“Absolutely. Absolutely,” Roberts said, diffusing the confusion, as people laughed.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images

Former President Donald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell concluded his initial arguments before the Supreme Court justices after nearly an hour.

Here are some of the key things that happened:

Power of states: Several of the justices from both ideological sides pressed the Trump lawyer about stripping states of their ability to exclude candidates from power, including whether an “admitted insurrectionist” could be removed from the ballot.

Mitchell argued that it was the role of Congress to determine whether someone should be disqualified — so even if a person admits to being an insurrectionist, states have no basis to act. ""Even if the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist, Section 3 (of the 14th Amendment) still allows the candidate to run for office, and even win election for office, and then see whether Congress lifts that disability after the election,"" Mitchell said in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts.

The role of Congress: Mitchell argued that Colorado's decision to remove Trump from the ballot was improper because, among other reasons, the state disqualified Trump before Congress explicitly gave it the power to do that.

The debate over the term ""officer"": The justices pressed Mitchell over whether the framers of the 14th Amendment believed the president is an “officer of” the United States, and therefore subject to the “insurrectionist ban” under Section 3. The argument is a central focus of the former president’s legal team, which believes that when the amendment’s framers wrote “officer,” they meant lower federal officials appointed by the president – not the president himself.

That discussion led to this particularly intense exchange:

“For an insurrection, there needs to be an organized, concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence,” Mitchell said.

“A chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection?” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked.

Mitchell responded: “This was a riot. It was not an insurrection.”

What happens next for Trump's legal team: Mitchell will have an opportunity to make brief rebuttal arguments to the justices at the end of the hearing, after lawyers for the Colorado voters and secretary of state finish presenting their case.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

Introduces a new process in which US Citizenship and Immigration Services would decide an asylum claim without it going through the immigration court system. The process doesn’t apply to unaccompanied migrant children.

We spoke to Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor and author of the new book, “Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away With It,” for a refresher on how grand juries and indictments work. Part of our conversation, conducted by phone, is below:

Grand jury vs. trial jury

WOLF: What should we know about the difference between a grand jury and a trial jury?

HONIG: A grand jury decides to indict, meaning to charge a case. A trial jury determines guilt or non-guilt.

A grand jury is bigger, typically 23 members, and the prosecutor only needs the votes of a majority of a grand jury — as opposed to a trial jury, which has to be unanimous.

The standard of proof in a grand jury is lower than a trial jury. In a grand jury, you only have to show probable cause, meaning more likely than not. But of course in a trial setting, you need to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The other thing to know is a grand jury is an almost entirely one-sided process.

Usually the only people allowed in the room at all are the grand jurors, the prosecutors, the witnesses and a court reporter.

In some instances, including New York, there’s a limited right of a potential defendant to present some evidence, but no defense lawyers are allowed in the room.

There’s no cross-examination of the prosecution’s evidence. There’s no presentation of defense evidence.

Close to every time a prosecutor seeks an indictment from a grand jury, he or she will get an indictment from the grand jury.

What is an indictment?

WOLF: How would you define “indictment”?

HONIG: It’s a document setting forth formal charges against the defendant.

3 Trump grand juries

WOLF: We have three grand juries that are top of mind — for election meddling in Georgia, at the federal level for declassified documents and then the Manhattan DA. How much variation is there in grand juries between city, county and federal?

HONIG: There are minor variations, but the basics remain the same.

Here’s an example of one of the minor variations in New York State, but not in the federal system, meaning for DOJ. The defendant does have some limited right to be notified and given a chance to testify or present defense evidence, which we saw play out with Trump and then him asking Robert Costello to testify.

That’s not the case federally. You do not have to give a defendant a chance to testify or present evidence. That’s one slight variation. But the basic fundamentals are the same.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday defended her decision to stay in the GOP primary race as her opponent Donald Trump is again expected to win in Michigan.

""We've only seen a handful of states vote. I mean, look, I've said this before as much as the media wants to jump ahead, we're taking this one state, one day at a time,"" she told CNN's Dana Bash.

Trump beat Haley by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands – and most notably last week in Haley's home state of of South Carolina where voters had elected her twice as their governor.

""America is blessed to be a democracy let people vote. Now in the next week, we're going to watch 20 states and territories vote,"" Haley said, referring to Super Tuesday on March 5. ""Let's let that happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 1,508 interviews with Republican primary voters across 38 different polling places on Election Day. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

As the evidentiary hearing got under way, an attorney for the Fulton County district attorney’s office told the judge that the entire motion over whether District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified ought to be dismissed.

Adam Abbate told the judge: “We’ve been able to determine that the claims the defendant has … are not only legally meritless” but are also “patiently false.”

The judge, Scott McAfee, denied Abbate’s renewed effort to stop the hearing.

Abbate argued that the testimony of one of the key witnesses in the case, Terrence Bradley, would be blocked by attorney-client privilege. Bradley represented Nathan Wade in his divorce proceedings. In this hearing, McAfee will consider allegations that Willis and Wade, he top prosecutor, engaged in a romantic relationship.

“We’d ask to renew our motion to quash,” Abbate said.

Ashleigh Merchant, the defense attorney who brought the claims against Wade and Willis, argued that the hearing should continue. “Let’s hear from some witnesses, judge,” Merchant said. “This is a very important issue and we need to have witnesses.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Brendan McDermid/Pool via Reuters

Before entering the courtroom in New York on Thursday morning, Trump claimed the hush money case against him is “election interference.” He also argued that it is interfering with his ability to campaign in South Carolina ahead of the February 24 Republican presidential primary there.

“How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again — this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said.

Trump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in South Carolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.”

Facts First: Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in New York on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances.

Rather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a hearing related to charges he faces in Georgia.

And he had not been scheduled to be in South Carolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the New York hearing. His next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week. His next rally after the Thursday hearing is a Saturday event in Michigan.

Trump is not planning to fly to South Carolina after the New York hearing. He is planning to fly back to Florida, where he lives.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

John Floyd, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ father, testified Friday that he taught his daughter to “hide cash” in case she needed it.

“What I told my child from the time she was a child was always have some money,” Floyd said, adding that he told her to always have “six months of cash always.”

Defense attorneys had pushed Willis over why she would keep a prevalence of cash in her home, which she said used to pay Nathan Wade back for various expenses. Floyd’s testimony corroborates Willis’ statements that she was taught to always have cash handy.

“Maybe, and excuse me your honor, I’m not trying to be racist, but it’s a black thing,” Floyd said. “I was trained, and most black folks, they hide cash or they keep cash, and I was trained you always keep some cash.”

“I gave my daughter her first cash box and told her, ‘always keep some cash,’” Floyd said.

Floyd referenced a time he had trouble paying for his meal at a restaurant several years ago to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“I had a American Express credit card and maybe a Visa,” Floyd said, as well as “a lot of what they call traveler’s checks.”

“For whatever reasons the man would not take my American Express credit card,” Floyd said. “So, I pulled out my Visa card, and he wouldn’t take my Visa card. So then I pulled out my traveler’s checks, and he said ‘we don’t take checks.’""

“The bill for my wife at the time … Fani and myself was like $9.95, I had a $10 bill. And I always remember that,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 1,508 interviews with Republican primary voters across 38 different polling places on Election Day. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Junfu Han/Detroit Free Press/USA Today Network

A Michigan court has affirmed the removal of Kristina Karamo as the state’s Republican Party chair, in a move that could settle a bitter leadership dispute just days before the party’s convention this weekend.

In a preliminary injunction issued Tuesday, Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi said Karamo was properly removed from her position on January 6, when Michigan’s GOP state committee voted to oust her, and that any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.”

Tuesday’s ruling, a copy of which was published by NBC News, also prevents Karamo from representing herself as chair of the Michigan Republican State Committee or conducting business on behalf of the party.

Tuesday’s development was a victory for Pete Hoekstra, a former ambassador and representative who has been recognized by the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump as the rightful chair of the Michigan Republican Party.

The Michigan GOP is set to hold its convention on Saturday, when it will allocate the state’s delegates for the Republican National Convention. Karamo had planned a rival convention, potentially complicating the process.

CNN previously reported that under Karamo’s leadership, the Michigan GOP suffered from internal strife and lackluster finances. A CNN investigation published in late 2023 found the party’s financial problems had become so bad that an internal report revealed the state party had a net income of just $71,000 over a nine-month period that ended with it $600,000 in debt.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The rest will be awarded at a state party convention Saturday. Former President Donald Trump defeated GOP rival Nikki Haley in the primary.

The split contests are the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in their new lineup.

Republicans opposed an earlier Michigan primary, which violated Republican National Committee rules limiting which states can hold contests before March 1. After Democrats, who control the legislature and the governor’s office, moved the Michigan primary to February 27 despite the Republican opposition, the RNC and the Michigan GOP came up with the hybrid model.

Further complicating matters: The Michigan GOP is in the middle of a battle over who actually leads the party, with two people who claim to be the party’s leaders scheduling dueling conventions Saturday. The RNC and Trump have recognized Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman and US ambassador to the Netherlands, as chair; Hoekstra scheduled a Saturday convention in Grand Rapids. However, Kristina Karamo, the election conspiracy theorist who the state party voted to oust in January, has refused to relinquish control, arguing she was unlawfully removed. She has planned a convention in Detroit.

Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi on Tuesday affirmed Karamo’s removal as state party chair, saying any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.” She has not yet said whether the convention she planned for Detroit would go forward. Regardless of Karamo’s actions, the RNC’s decision to recognize Hoekstra signaled the party would accept delegates from the convention he will oversee.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Blumenthal says  CNN","Sen. Richard Blumenthal speaks to reporters in the Capitol on Tuesday. CNN

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal dismissed concerns over the potential weakness of President Joe Biden’s electoral coalition — which has faced challenges amid concerns from Arab Americans and progressives over the administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

""I think the Biden coalition is strong, alive and well and focused on the basic accomplishments of this administration, as it will be on election day. I am very, very hopeful that a pause can diminish some of the apparent friction involved in that coalition, but I think it will hold together,"" the senator from Connecticut told CNN.

His comments come ahead of today’s Democratic primary in Michigan where there has been an organized effort, including by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian American, to send a message to the Biden campaign by urging voters to vote ""uncommitted.""

Blumenthal’s emphasis on a potential pause in the fighting in Gaza, which Biden said could possibly be reached as early as the end of this upcoming weekend, illustrates the ongoing political ramifications of the war.

Blumenthal also added that he’s ""very concerned"" about a government shutdown, pointing to its possible catastrophic consequences. ""It takes people focus on the real end game here which is not unnecessary and frivolous riders to prove a point or make a political stunt,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

There was a muted response in the room of Nikki Haley’s campaign party when CNN projected that Donald Trump would win the South Carolina primary — until the former president started speaking.

A man started waving a South Carolina loves Nikki Haley sign in front of the projection of Trump speaking, and moments later chants for Haley broke out.

“I don’t think it is over,” Nell Parker, a Haley supporter in the room told CNN. Parker said she plans to rally North Carolina for Haley, and feels good about her odds going forward.

“We are for anyone against Trump,” said another Haley supporter in the room.

Others said they did not trust the projection, and were frustrated about polls generally.

No one in the room said they believe this is the beginning of the end for Haley.

The Haley campaign say they feel that they did everything they could to effectively compete in South Carolina, but aides said frustrations arose throughout the last month given the strong hold that Trump has on the state. For example, the Republican group at Clemson University endorsed Trump, which was frustrating for Haley’s team given the school is her alma mater.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Alabas Farhat. From Michigan House Democrats

Michigan state Rep. Alabas Farhat is voting ""uncommitted"" in today's primary to send a message to President Joe Biden to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and urge him to live up to his campaign promises from 2020.

""I want to make it clear that today's vote is an appeal to the White House, it is an appeal to President Biden to be the leader that we know he can, a leader that he promised the nation he would be in 2020, when he campaigned saying that he was going to restore dignity and humanity to the White House,"" the Democratic representative from Michigan's 3rd District told CNN.

Farhat said that there are thousands of Michiganders who are watching the atrocities overseas with horror and anguish. They're watching ""their loved ones dying, children starving to death and they're hearing the screams of parents who are holding their children, their lifeless children,"" he said. He said the coalition wants to see an effort toward restoring humanitarian aid and lasting peace.

Farhat added that the push to vote uncommitted during the primary will probably not impact Biden winning, but those involved are building a diverse coalition to show the White House that there is a unified message calling for a ceasefire.

""The message though is that a plurality of voters, Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Gen Z voters are coming together — African American voters are coming together in a coalition to tell the president that, 'Hey, we want — we want to see you call for the ceasefire. We want to see our White House reflect the values that we know it should reflect,'"" Farhat said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9. The trial is currently set to start in May.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Two of the Big Three companies, GM and Chrysler, went bankrupt in 2009 and needed federal bailouts to survive.

That took a bite not only out of employment, but out of auto wages, as the United Auto Workers union agreed to deep concessions, including a lower tier of wages, to help keep all three companies alive. But that helped drag down wages in the state overall.

The state’s median household income was higher than the national average until 2000, according to the Growing Michigan Together Council, a group formed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to develop solutions to Michigan’s challenges. The state’s median income declined relative to the US level over the past five decades.

Today, the median household income in the state was just under $67,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau.

However, following a six-week strike last fall at GM, Ford and Stellantis, the United Auto Workers union won immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members. Pay for members is expected to rise more than 30% during the life of the contract, which expires in 2028.

While jobs in the state’s auto and parts plants have stabilized in recent years, jobs in the manufacturing sector overall have edged up by 4.5% since the end of 2020. But that still hasn’t recaptured jobs lost in that sector during the first year of the pandemic. Overall employment in the state in December was up 9.6% from the end of 2020, but still off 0.5% from December of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic.

Rebecca Cook/Reuters

President Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win tonight’s Democratic primary in Michigan. But that hasn’t stopped those who believe he should be pushing harder for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas from organizing a vote for “uncommitted.”

That is, a vote in the primary for “uncommitted” is a protest vote against Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza. It’s not clear how well this effort will do, but a high percentage of support could suggest general election trouble for Biden in the Wolverine State.

Take a look at the 2020 Republican presidential primaries: President Donald Trump romped to wins everywhere with 94% of the vote nationally, but his weakest region (or census subdivision) by far was New England. He was under 90% of the primary vote in all those states and even came in with less than 80% in Connecticut. In the general election, all the New England states swung against Trump by about 2 to 4 times as much as the swing against him nationally compared with 2016.

In the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, we saw a somewhat similar phenomenon. President Barack Obama won about 90% of the vote nationally. He got below 60% of the primary vote in a line of states from Oklahoma to Arkansas to Kentucky to West Virginia.

All four were among the six states that swung the most toward the Republican candidate on the presidential level from 2004 to 2012.

It’s not exactly clear what a low level of support tonight for Biden would be. Still, he got over 95% of the vote in South Carolina and nearly 90% in Nevada. If he falls significantly short of those levels, it could be ominous.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA/AP

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of House progressives, said the number of ""uncommitted"" votes in Michigan is a major warning sign for President Joe Biden in November.

“This is exactly what I warned about several months ago,” Jayapal told CNN. “The war on Gaza is a deep moral issue and the lack of attention and empathy for this perspective from the administration is breaking apart the fragile coalition we built to elect Joe Biden in 2020.”

Jayapal says there is “still a little bit of time to change this dynamic.” But she added: “It has to be a dramatic policy and rhetorical shift from the president on this issue and a new strategy to rebuild a real partnership with progressives in multiple communities who are absolutely key to winning the election.”

Organizers of the movement to vote ""uncommitted"" had hoped at least 10,000 people would cast their vote for the cause, a nod to the 10,700-vote margin that delivered the state to Donald Trump in 2016. They had far surpassed that goal just before 11 p.m. Tuesday night.

One of the leading voices in the campaign to vote “uncommitted,” former Democratic US Rep. Andy Levin, said the early numbers show a “historic” result. He said he felt the effort was a success in conveying people's anger to the president.

Levin’s message to voters who are mad about the war in Gaza was: “Don't stay home, don't stay home. Go out and shake your fist. Go to the ballot box and tell the president you're mad otherwise, he won’t know.”

Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to convince Judge Aileen Cannon that she will need to hold a hearing on their request for more discovery from several agencies and the White House.

Their request depends on an argument that officials from those agencies were advising prosecutors on prosecutorial decisions that essentially make them members of the prosecution team.

Cannon seemed open to the idea of holding a hearing, but pressed Trump attorney Emil Bove on what such a hearing would focus on and how it would work. Bove pointed to several examples of what he said was collaboration between multiple government agencies like the National Archives and the White House.

Bove added that a hearing where prosecutors would address some of these arguments would have to take place in a secure location, especially since it would touch on how classified material in the case was reviewed.

Prosecutors denied these claims of inter-agency collaboration earlier in the hearing.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Momentum to plot a swift impeachment of Mayorkas picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republicans expressed openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border.

Border authorities encountered more than 225,000 migrants along the US-Mexico border in December, marking the highest monthly total recorded since 2000, according to preliminary Homeland Security statistics shared with CNN. And in fiscal year 2022, according to the Department of Homeland Security, 1.4 million individuals who were encountered at the border were removed, which is more than in any previous year.

The border crisis has galvanized Republicans, unifying their party for more aggressive action on an issue central to the 2024 campaign, and a handful of the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to scuttle an effort to impeach Mayorkas in November 2023 recently signaled they’d back impeaching him if it went through the committee process, which happened late last month.

Moderate Republicans, including ones in districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020, also signaled more willingness to impeach Mayorkas than the president – a sign of the shifting political terrain on the issue.

While House Republicans have sought to use Mayorkas' impeachment to address their issues with Biden's handling of the border, the GOP also helped to tank – along with Donald Trump – a major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package that would have marked a tough change to immigration law championed by one of the Senate's most conservative members. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber, even if it ever made it out of the Senate.

Mayorkas wrote in a letter in advance of the vote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.”

Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images

In 2020, Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American activist and longtime Michigan Democrat, backed Joe Biden for president. But like many Arab Americans, she feels betrayed by his response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the rising civilian death toll. Biden would need to curtail US military aid to Israel and call for a permanent ceasefire before she could even consider supporting him in November, she said.

And as for Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Michigan, she’s leading the charge to convince Democrats to vote “uncommitted.” Elabed is the effort’s campaign manager and the sister of Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman in Congress.

The Listen to Michigan campaign was launched less than three weeks ago by Elabed and other Arab American activists in the Wolverine State. It’s a last-minute effort to send a “clear, sharp message” to Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party to address the concerns of the coalition that helped him win in 2020, Elabed said.

Since its launch, the effort has been endorsed by progressive groups such as Our Revolution and more than three dozen current and former state and local leaders, including Tlaib and former US Rep. Andy Levin. Volunteers have contacted more than 100,000 voters in the state, according to organizers.

The president’s reelection campaign has responded to the Listen to Michigan effort by emphasizing Biden’s domestic accomplishments, framing the general election as a binary choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump and stressing that the administration is listening to people’s concerns and open to future conversations.

Why this matters: If thousands of Michigan Democrats vote uncommitted Tuesday, it would be the clearest sign yet that Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza could cost him critical votes in November. Arab and Muslim Americans make up a substantial voting bloc in Michigan, a key battleground state.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

Americans for Prosperity Action’s endorsement in November was a significant boost for Haley as she sought to become the leading alternative to former President Donald Trump in the GOP primary. The conservative group, which pledged to back a single contender in the GOP presidential primary for the first time in its history, deployed its vast resources and standing army of activists on behalf of the former United Nations ambassador.

But while the race has come down to Haley and Trump, the former president remains the dominant front-runner after a strong victory in Haley’s home state on Saturday.

Americans for Prosperity President and CEO Emily Seidel emphasized that AFP Action is still standing with Haley, even if it’s no longer spending to boost her campaign, writing in the email that she “has shown us again and again that we made the right decision in supporting her candidacy and she continues to have our strong endorsement.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Gary Peters heads to the floor of the Senate for a vote on Capitol Hill on February 11, in Washington, DC. Samuel Corum/Getty Images

Sen. Gary Peters, the chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm who hails from Michigan, downplayed the progressive-led effort to vote “uncommitted” in Tuesday’s primary as a form of protest over President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

“I'm not sure what we'll see tonight, we'll be watching that number. But it's certainly not unusual for people to vote uncommitted,” Peters told CNN, ticking off the number of uncommitted votes in previous cycles, including when Barack Obama was president and ran unopposed.

Asked if he harbors any concerns about cracks in Biden’s coalition, Peters said: “No, no, I don't see that. But we'll continue to hold that together and continue to be strong. You know, if you look at former President Trump — he has an opponent taking 40% in primaries away from him. To me that's more significant.”

However, others in the party have expressed concern about the organized “uncommitted” effort — led in part by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — even as they say they respect the views of voters and acknowledge it’s imperative for Biden to hear out their concerns in a key battleground state.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the other Michigan senator, said on CNN earlier today she thinks the campaign to urge voters to vote uncommitted is “certainly not helpful.”

And one House Democrat told CNN there is “massive” frustration inside the party over the effort, worried it could backfire if it winds up helping get Trump elected. “The president is weak enough without hobbling him more with a concerted campaign against him,” the lawmaker told CNN.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on February 15, in Atlanta, Georgia Alyssa Pointer/Pool/Getty Images

Several advisers and confidants of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis privately urged her in recent weeks to encourage top prosecutor Nathan Wade voluntarily step aside, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.

Willis is being advised by people inside and outside of the district attorney’s office, though one source said there is a difference of legal opinions about what to do next.

Willis and Wade have so far resisted the push for him to resign from the Georgia election subversion case, a stance that the two reinforced in their defiant testimony Thursday in an Atlanta-area courtroom where they pushed back on allegations that their now-ended romantic relationship created a disqualifying conflict of interest.

CNN previously reported that Willis had no plans to recuse herself from the case after allegations surfaced that she and Wade engaged in an improper romantic relationship. Sources familiar with the situation said prior to Thursday’s hearing that Wade also did not have immediate plans to step away from the case either but acknowledged his future was more uncertain.

Wade is interchangeable and could be replaced without forcing the case to be assigned to another prosecutor's office, multiple sources familiar with the situation stressed before and after he testified on Thursday.

Privately, Wade has told others working on the Georgia election case he does not want to be a distraction, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

It remains unclear if Wade’s testimony has moved the needle at all in terms of the likelihood he resigns. A spokesperson for the district attorney’s office declined to comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

In a report released Thursday, Special Counsel Robert Hur did not recommend charges against Biden over his handling of classified documents. In his explanation for not recommending prosecution, Hur described the president as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”

Trump, addressing a National Rifle Association rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said Biden did ""a lot"" of the activity related to retaining documents ""when he was at a very young age.""

""He was mentally a little better than he is right now,"" he continued, addressing Biden's mental acuity, something he did not immediately seize on yesterday in the wake of the report.

The former president also said Biden had made recovery of classified documents by investigators ""almost impossible,"" later claiming that he cooperated with investigators more than Biden did.

However, Hur made clear in his report how different Biden's and Trump’s classified information cases are — namely, that Biden cooperated with investigators while Trump did not.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Evan Vucci/AP

On any other week, special counsel Robert Hur's writing that President Joe Biden could be perceived as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" would have been a damning portrait of a sitting president.

For Biden, however, the special counsel's comments about his memory came at an even more inopportune moment. On three separate occasions this week, Biden has confused the names of European leaders who died years ago with those who more recently served in office, raising more questions about his mental recall.

In those episodes, Biden was describing an international summit in 2021. He described speaking with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, and French President Francois Mitterrand, who died in 1996.

Only about 45 minutes before the report was released publicly, the White House was working to downplay to slip-ups, saying it’s common for people to misspeak.

“Many people, elected officials…they can misspeak sometimes,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, citing recent examples from House Speaker Mike Johnson and TV host Sean Hannity.

She said in meetings, she had never witnessed Biden confuse names.

Yet the picture Hur painted of Biden in the report went well beyond the occasional mistaken name. He said in interviews, the president did not remember the years he was vice president or when his son Beau died.

Immediately after the report was released, White House officials and Biden's personal lawyer forcefully rejected what they said were inappropriate and incorrect statements about his memory.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Oklahoma GOP Sen. James Lankford, a key Republican negotiator on the bipartisan border deal, told CNN's Dana Bash that he was ""legitimately surprised"" at where Republicans were on the border bill, a day before the bill will face its first vote in the Senate.

""I'm legitimately surprised at where we are at this moment because -- as Republicans -- we've done lots of press conferences at the border, we’ve had lots of conversations, saying things have to change,"" Lankford said on CNN's ""Inside Politics.""

He also did not promise to vote to advance the bill on Wednesday, saying he would be “glad” to “delay it” to give his colleagues more time to review the bill.

Norma Anderson, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to disqualify Donald Trump from office, is a lifelong Republican who has had a storied political career, including stints as the first-ever woman majority leader in both chambers of the Colorado legislature.

“I’m an old-fashioned Republican that believes in strong defense, supporting business, and helping those who don’t know how to help themselves, and less government, and a fair tax base,” Anderson said.

Here are some highlights of her career:

She spent 12 years in the statehouse , before having to leave due to term limits. While there, from 1997 to 1998, she was the majority leader of the lower chamber. After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003.

After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003. Her record: While serving in the Colorado statehouse, Anderson helped enact legislation to improve child literacy and lower the cost of in-state colleges and established a home nursing program with funds from a landmark lawsuit against the large tobacco companies.

Battling Trump – especially in court – comes with acclaim in some circles, and vitriol in others. Anderson said she has received a lot of support from friends and family, except for one or two holdouts who are still die-hard Trump supporters. She said most of her friends weren’t surprised that she got involved in the case.

“I was born four months before FDR was elected,” Anderson said. “I’ve lived through a lot of presidents. Some I liked, some I didn’t. But not one of them caused an insurrection, until Donald Trump.”

Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

A federal appeals court on Tuesday said that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency, flatly rejecting Trump’s arguments that he shouldn’t have to go on trial on federal election subversion charges.

Here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's decision:

Trump’s behavior after the 2020 election could be criminal: The judges made it clear that Trump's actions could be prosecuted in a court of law.

""Vital public interest"" of letting trial proceed weighed heavily on the court: The judges cited the public interest in accountability for potential crimes committed by a former president, and how that overcame Trump’s argument that immunity was necessary to protect the institution of the presidency. They flatly rejected Trump’s claim that his criminal indictment would have a “chilling effect” on future administrations.

Trial timing will be up to the Supreme Court: A key part of Trump’s legal strategy has been to delay his criminal cases until after the 2024 election. Now, the trial's timing will be in the hands of the Supreme Court. If Trump is successful with getting the Supreme Court to hear the appeal, the criminal trial would not resume until after the high court decides what to do with his request for a pause.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Evelyn Hockstein/Re

The Supreme Court appears poised to back former President Donald Trump and fend off a blockbuster challenge to his eligibility to appear on Colorado’s ballot as a presidential candidate in 2024, a move that would extract the justices from one of the most politically fraught appeals in the court’s history.

If Trump is pulled off the ballot in Colorado, Chief Justice John Roberts predicted that other states would eventually attempt to knock other candidates off the ballot. That, he signaled, would be inconsistent with the purpose and history of the 14th Amendment.

“It’ll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,” Roberts said. “That’s a pretty daunting consequence.”

At issue is a provision in the 14th Amendment that bars certain public officials from serving in the government again if they took part in an insurrection. The six Republican and independent voters from Colorado who challenged Trump say his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol makes him ineligible under that “insurrection ban.”

A majority of the conservative justices on the court posed tough questions to the lawyers representing the voters -- including whether the insurrection ban can be enforced without a law first passed by Congress – though it was unclear which route the court might take.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed the attorneys about a 19th century decision from a lower court that suggested it was congress, not states, that must act first on enforcing an insurrection ban.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, on the other hand, stressed the idea that the ban only applies to serving in office – not necessarily running for office.

The amendment’s key provision, Section 3, says in part: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Steve Womack Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

House Republicans were exasperated after the stunning defeat of their resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, lobbing some criticism at their own leadership over the fiasco even as they plan to bring the vote back up again when they have better attendance.

GOP Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said it was unwise of leadership to put the bill on the floor not knowing for sure whether it would pass, adding to the perception that House Republicans can’t govern.

“It's hard to sit there and see it, you know, I mean, it's tough. We're in a difficult spot right now,” he said. “If we whipped, we need a better whip. I'm not talking about the person in the job. I'm just saying the whip count. We need to know exactly where we are and we need to be careful not to get out ahead of our skis and put something on the floor that we don't have certainty on.”

Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina also criticized GOP leadership’s strategy on the Mayorkas vote.

“I would have thought they would have known that. I would have thought that would have been basic,” Norman said of the whip count. “They’re good on the other side of knowing that. Is it that hard?”

“But it did happen, it went down, and we live to fight another day,” he said.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene disputed that it was a miscalculation to put the bill on the floor, telling CNN, ""I don’t think it’s a failure at all,"" and warning that the Republicans who voted to sink the impeachment articles would be hearing from voters.

“I’m sure they’ll hear from their constituents. I’m sure they’re probably hearing from them already, but I think they should listen to them,"" the Georgia Republican said.

“I look forward to having Steve Scalise back. Of course, been praying for him this whole time to beat cancer,” she added, referring to the House majority leader who was absent from the vote as he recovers in Louisiana from a stem cell transplant.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Eduardo Munoz/Reuters/FILE

After turning several recent trials and court hearings into campaign stops, Donald Trump is not expected to be in the room when the highest court in the land takes up the question of his ballot eligibility, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN.

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

While many legal experts believe Trump could prevail on the ballot challenges issue, his appearance could be considered disruptive to the normally staid and above-the-fray decorum of the Supreme Court.

Trump and his team have treated various court appearances as opportunities for him to cry “election interference,” call out who he deems “Trump-hating” judges and attack the system as rigged “political persecution.” His presence and the attendant

Since the Supreme Court first convened in 1790, 116 justices have served on the bench. Of those, 108 have been White men.

But in recent decades the court has become more diverse. Over half of its appointed justices since 1990 have been women or minorities.

The two most recently appointed justices were women, and one a woman of color. Ketanji Brown Jackson, previously a federal appeals court judge, in 2022 became the first Black woman on the high court. She succeeded Stephen Breyer, who is White.

And Amy Coney Barrett, also previously a federal appeals court judge, was chosen by Donald Trump to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020.

Here’s how the demographics of the nation’s highest court have stacked up since its beginning.

Four have been people of color

Only three African American justices, Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson have served on the court.

The first appointment – when Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Marshall – was in 1967. When Johnson announced the nomination, he said he thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it.

Thomas’s appointment happened decades later, in 1991 under George H.W. Bush.

Jackson became the court’s third Black justice in 2022 after being nominated by Joe Biden.

Sonia Sotomayor is the first and only Hispanic justice in history. (Some say Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was Portuguese, was the first Hispanic member, but he doesn’t qualify under current Census standards.) She was nominated by Barack Obama in 2009.

No justices so far have identified as Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander.

And no women or people of color have served as chief justices of the nation’s highest court.

Six have been women

Of the 116 justices in history, 110 – or 94.8% – have been men. Until 1981, every Supreme Court justice was male. But Ronald Reagan promised he’d put a woman on the court, and during his first year in office he kept that promise by appointing Sandra Day O’Connor.

Before that, presidents had appointed women to lower courts. While Harry Truman, who was president from 1945-1953, thought about nominating a woman to the high court, sitting justices at the time said women “would inhibit their conference deliberations.”

Bill Clinton made the second appointment of a woman to the high court by nominating Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993.

And Barack Obama appointed two women, the aforementioned Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, whom he appointed in 2010.

Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett and Jackson all sit on the current court.

Eight have been Jewish

At its founding, the court was made up almost entirely of Protestant members, and a majority of the 116 justices throughout history have been Protestants.

The court today is more diverse. There are currently six Catholic justices, not including Neil Gorsuch — nominated by Trump in 2017 — who was raised Catholic but has more recently worshiped at an Episcopal church.

The US has never had a Jewish president, but eight Jewish justices have sat on the bench, including Kagan who currently sits on the bench.

There has never been a Muslim or Hindu justice on the Supreme Court.

Ivy League graduates dominate in recent decades

While the educational law background of many Supreme Court justices’ has varied in past centuries, modern history has been less so. Of the 60 justices confirmed between 1902 and 2022, 15 graduated from Harvard, seven from Yale and four from Columbia law schools.

On today’s court, all but one — Barrett, who attended Notre Dame Law School — hail from Yale or Harvard. The four Yale graduates are Brett Kavanaugh, Sotomayor, Thomas and Samuel Alito, and the four Harvard graduates are Gorsuch, Kagan, Jackson and Chief Justice John Roberts.

Since Oliver Wendell Holmes’ appointment in 1902, the Supreme Court has maintained at least one Harvard law graduate, and it has usually had multiple graduates.

Yale Law School did not have a graduate on the court until Potter Stewart’s confirmation in 1958.

Why diversity matters

The Supreme Court has ruled on a diverse set of topics and sees a wide array of cases.

It’s laid out decisions that affect many segments of the nation’s population, like whether schools should be segregated, whether women can get abortions and if public accommodations can refuse services based on religious beliefs.

The court has heard cases that none of its members can directly relate to. Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was decided by nine justices, none of whom have identified as gay. No past or present justices have publicly identified themselves as anything other than straight.

In 2016, Sotomayor said the court could use more diversity.

“A different perspective can permit you to more fully understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand,” she said.

Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks during a campaign rally at the Indigo Hall and Events venue on February 5, in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Brandon Bell/Getty Images

Ahead of Tuesday's Nevada primary, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s campaign outlined their reasoning behind participating in the state’s primary election instead of the party-run GOP caucuses on Thursday.

“We have not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada. We aren't going to pay $55,000 to a Trump entity to participate in a process that is rigged for Trump. Nevada is not and has never been our focus. I’m truly not sure what the Trump team is up to out there, but they seem pretty spun up about it,” Haley’s campaign manager Betsy Ankney said during a press call on Monday.

More on the dueling GOP contests: While there will be a GOP primary Tuesday, Republicans have chosen to award their delegates via the caucuses, and the dueling contests have caused some confusion among Nevada voters.

Some Republican presidential contenders, including Haley, filed to run in the primary. Former President Donald Trump chose not to appear on the primary ballot, opting instead to appear on the GOP caucus ballot, which effectively guarantees his victory.

Haley has been focusing on her home state of South Carolina ahead of the GOP primary contest on February 24.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

They were talking about Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies extremism. He testified in November in Denver District Court about Trump’s history of embracing of far-right extremists how those militant groups interpreted his incendiary rhetoric on the morning of January 6, immediately proceeding the violent storming of the US Capitol.

Simi’s testimony ended up being influential to the Colorado Supreme Court’s eventual decision to bar Trump from the ballot. But Alito pressed lawyer Jason Murray on whether other states might draw different conclusions, if they were to vet Trump’s actions on January 6. He suggested that other states might not even consider Simi as an expert.

The questioning was yet another example of how the justices appear to be skeptical of the effort to bar Trump from the ballot.

Here’s CNN’s coverage from when Simi testified at the trial:

Trump was often “using language with a wink and a nod,” Simi said, but members of these extremist groups consistently interpreted his comments as a “clarion call” toward “anger, resentment and mobilization.” This ramped up in summer 2020 as Trump began claiming he was being cheated in the presidential election, Simi said.

Eric Olson, an attorney for the Colorado challengers, played clips from Trump’s January 6 speech, where he urged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” so they could “save” the country (Though, at times, he also said they should do so peacefully.)

Right-wing extremists understood those words as “a call to violence,” Simi testified.

""Within far-right extremist culture, fighting is meant to be taken literally … especially within the context as it’s laid out, that these threats are imminent, and that you’re going to lose your country. Then, fighting would be understood as requiring violent action.”

“Far-right extremists really were galvanized by his candidacy starting in 2015,” Simi said. “And a relationship really emerged between Donald Trump and far-right extremists, with far-right extremists really seeing him as speaking their language, and really addressing many of their key grievances.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Justice Brett Kavanaugh tossed an important question to Trump’s attorney about a 19th century decision dealing with the same issue the court is wrestling with now.

Known as “Griffin’s case,” the 1869 decision found that the insurrection ban could not be enforced without some action first from Congress. The opinion was written by Chief Justice Salmon Chase. It was not a Supreme Court decision but it’s one of the closest things the Supreme Court has to a precedent.

By asking the question, Kavanaugh – often a key swing vote — seems to be signaling an interest in siding with Trump in a narrow way: By ruling that the insurrection ban at issue cannot be enforced with a law enacted by Congress.

“Don’t you think Griffin’s case” is important in “trying to figure out what the original meaning” of the insurrection ban is, Kavanaugh asked.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects.

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

Introduces a new process in which US Citizenship and Immigration Services would decide an asylum claim without it going through the immigration court system. The process doesn’t apply to unaccompanied migrant children.

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.

3, 2023 Latest on the new Congress and House speaker vote  CNN","A look inside the House chamber in February. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP/File)

The 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.

Rep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.

Republicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.

Here are key things to know about Tuesday’s vote:

How the day will unfold: Congress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, Jan. 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.

Members will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.

Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.

Members can vote for anyone they want: There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.

Both parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead. McCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.

If neither wins a majority, a “floor fight” happens: Lawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected. This is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker. In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.

It doesn’t always require 218 votes: One important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

Former President Donald Trump will not accept a plea deal in the indictment brought by a Manhattan grand jury but does plan to file “substantial legal challenges” to the indictment, his attorney Joe Tacopina said.

“President Trump will not take a plea deal in this case. It's not gonna happen,” Tacopina said in an interview with NBC News on Friday.

“I don't know if it's gonna make it to trial because we have substantial legal challenges that we have to ... front before we get to that point,” Tacopina said when asked if he expects to take the case to trial.

Trump will “absolutely” voluntarily surrender to Manhattan law enforcement, the defense attorney said, adding the former president is “not going to hole up in Mar-a-Lago.”

Logistics are currently being worked, he said.

Meanwhile, Trump attorney Jim Trusty said Friday he expects that the former president's legal team will file motions to dismiss his indictment before a trial could potentially get underway.

“I would think in very short order, you'll see a motion to dismiss — or several motions to dismiss — talking about this kind of impossible theory of stacking a federal crime into a state misdemeanor, statute of limitations issues and very importantly, the intent to defraud. That's an element of these false record keeping charges. That's just not present here,"" Trusty told CNN This Morning.

The lawyer said he did not know ""about the exact timing"" as there isn't a case number yet but he noted that it will ""be soon.""

""I think this will be something you can expect in days or weeks, not weeks or months,"" he added.

Tacopina told Good Morning America that the former president ""will not be put in handcuffs.""

Responding to CNN reporting that Trump has been charged on more than 30 counts related to business fraud, Tacopina said he does not know the nature of the charges against Trump or how many there are, but added, “If it's correct, it means they've taken each transaction, each check, each payment, each entry and made a separate charge.”

Tacopina said he does not know when the charges will be unsealed but suggested it “might likely be Tuesday.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Arizona's Maricopa County expects to start releasing Friday evening the first results from its outstanding 290,000 mail-in ballots that voters dropped off on Election Day, a top official told CNN late Thursday.

""We should start to see those tomorrow, I believe – we’ll start seeing those come in,"" said Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors.

Maricopa is Arizona's most populous county and it includes the city of Phoenix.

The mail-in ballots dropped off were a record for the county, Gates said. “It’s a lot of ballots that people are trying to process, but we’re going to get through it. We’re going to do it on a timeline that’s frankly consistent with how long it takes us to get this done every two and every four years.”

Gates pushed back on criticism from Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who has been questioning the integrity of the elections and the length of time to get results.

“There’s nothing out of the ordinary; it makes me wonder if Kari Lake has really been following elections in the past in Maricopa County,” he said.

On Thursday, Maricopa County staff verified nearly all of the 290,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day. It updated an additional tranche of just over 78,000 ballots on Thursday night.

The estimated ballots remaining, according to the county, include:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

McHenry signaled the two sides are trading legislative text as they go along instead of just toplines, so they’re not starting from scratch when they go to write the actual bill.

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

The trial has spanned nearly six weeks so far with testimony from a total of 25 witnesses – 24 of which were in person.

Ivanka Trump was the last witness called before the attorney general’s office rested its case. She followed testimony from her father and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric.

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Donald Trump’s worth on financial statements.

The attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

The attorney general is also seeking to ban the Trumps from doing business in New York.

The trial has seen a slew of fireworks, including the judge imposing two fines on Donald Trump totaling $15,000 for violating his gag order forbidding anyone from commenting about his staff. The former president had repeatedly criticized Engoron’s law clerk.

Donald Trump attended court a total of seven days, where he attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, the judge, and the case against him.

He did the same when he took the stand earlier this week with lengthy speeches during his testimony that sparked multiple admonishments from the judge.

Trump’s attorneys are set to begin their defense on Monday and indicated they would finish by mid-December.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He also offered qualified support for social spending programs to help support newborns and new parents but stopped short of specifically endorsing paid family leave for all Americans or subsidized child care.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

McHenry signaled the two sides are trading legislative text as they go along instead of just toplines, so they’re not starting from scratch when they go to write the actual bill.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images

An apparent backtrack by Donald Trump’s ex-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen threw the New York civil fraud trial into more chaos Wednesday afternoon.

Cohen gave combative testimony in the face of cross-examination to two Trump attorneys on Wednesday, after he had implicated Trump the day prior for directing him to “reverse-engineer” financial statements to increase his net worth.

On Wednesday morning, Trump attorney Alina Habba pressed Cohen about his 2019 congressional testimony when he said, “Not that I recall, no,” in response to a question about whether Trump had directed him or Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to inflate numbers for Trump’s personal statement.

Cohen said to Habba that he was lying in his testimony.

But after lunch, Cliff Robert, another Trump attorney, pressed Cohen further on his congressional testimony, and the former Trump attorney had a different response, saying that the testimony was not false.

“So, Mr. Trump never asked you to inflate the numbers on his financial statement,"" Robert asked.

“Correct,"" Cohen said.

That response prompted Trump’s attorney to ask the first time for a directed verdict to dismiss the trial because Cohen was a key witness in the case.

Engoron denied it, which led to Trump abruptly leaving the courtroom.

The New York attorney general's lawyers asked Cohen in follow up questions to clarify his response. Cohen said that Trump never directly asked to inflate the numbers, but that what he wanted was known, because he spoke like “a mob boss.”

""He tells you what he wants without specifically telling you,"" Cohen said. ""We understood what he wanted.”

At the conclusion of Cohen’s testimony, Robert renewed his request for a verdict to and ""end this case once and for all.""

“Absolutely denied,” Engoron said in response.

The case has evidence, credible or not, “all over the place,” the judge said.

Engoron also said he didn’t consider Cohen to be a “key witness” in the case, in which the New York attorney general accused Trump and his business of fraud in a $250 million suit.

“There’s enough evidence in this case to fill this courtroom,” Engoron said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

The trial has spanned nearly six weeks so far with testimony from a total of 25 witnesses – 24 of which were in person.

Ivanka Trump was the last witness called before the attorney general’s office rested its case. She followed testimony from her father and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric.

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Donald Trump’s worth on financial statements.

The attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

The attorney general is also seeking to ban the Trumps from doing business in New York.

The trial has seen a slew of fireworks, including the judge imposing two fines on Donald Trump totaling $15,000 for violating his gag order forbidding anyone from commenting about his staff. The former president had repeatedly criticized Engoron’s law clerk.

Donald Trump attended court a total of seven days, where he attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, the judge, and the case against him.

He did the same when he took the stand earlier this week with lengthy speeches during his testimony that sparked multiple admonishments from the judge.

Trump’s attorneys are set to begin their defense on Monday and indicated they would finish by mid-December.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The craft, described by US intelligence as a surveillance balloon, presented a comparatively low-tech, modest security threat compared to the multilayered espionage, economic, cyber, military and geopolitical rivalry escalating every day.

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He also offered qualified support for social spending programs to help support newborns and new parents but stopped short of specifically endorsing paid family leave for all Americans or subsidized child care.

Usually incumbent presidents win party primaries in a walk. But due to the Democratic Party's beef with the date of New Hampshire's primary, President Joe Biden isn't even appearing on the ballot in New Hampshire. The Democratic Party is also penalizing New Hampshire by taking away most of its delegates to the national convention.

Even though he's boycotting the ballot, Biden's supporters are still hoping he wins and have organized a campaign to encourage Democratic primary voters to write his name in on the ballot.

You won't usually hear about write-in campaigns because they're usually just about impossible to win. It's the “triple lindy” of American politics.

The most recent, major write-in victory in a nationally important race happened in 2010, when Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, lost her party primary to Joe Miller, who mounted a challenge from the right wing. It was only the second successful Senate write-in campaign.

The late Sen. Strom Thurmond, a seriously controversial figure today, won the first general election write-in campaign back in 1954, riding a wave of frustration after the party anointed a candidate to fill the shoes of the primary winner who had died.

So is a write-in win impossible? No. Is it a frequent occurrence? It is not.

Biden should have an easier time as a write-in candidate than either Murkowski or Thurmond. None of his competition has anywhere close to his name recognition. Plus, the people who show up for a Democratic primary in a year when their party is the incumbent are perhaps more politically attuned than the public at large.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Lucy Luckovich

The all-day hearing on former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’ request to move the Georgia election interference case to federal court in Atlanta has concluded.

US District Judge Steve Jones did not rule from the bench on Monday. He acknowledged that arraignments in the criminal case were scheduled for September 6, and said he would rule as quickly as possible.

Meadows’ attorney said “we are entitled to a prompt determination” of whether his state criminal charges will be moved to federal court.

As the hearing drew to a close, one of the judge’s final questions was whether Meadows had any federal authorities that Trump didn’t have as president. District Attorney Fani Willis’ office said no, but Meadows team said yes, arguing that the chief of staff has a “wide range of authority.”

The breadth of his federal authority is key to determining whether the case will stay in state court.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote to watch in the case, suggested one of the main arguments raised by challengers was “at war” with the history of the insurrection ban at center in the case.

“The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Roberts said. “On the other hand, it augmented federal power.”

Roberts suggested the idea that the amendment would give states power to remove candidates under the provision would be “at war” with the whole thrust and history of the 14th Amendment.

The challengers claimed the 14th Amendment lets states bar insurrectionists from the ballot – which means in simple terms that Congress was providing some very strong powers to the states. But Congress wrote and ratified that amendment during the Reconstruction Era, when they were trying to reign in rogue Southern states after the Civil War and reassert federal powers over civil rights.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Unlike campaign events – which I usually cover – inside the Supreme Court, no electronics are allowed. Just pen and paper.

Even the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

From where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.

While Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.

You cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Mitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply...”

Kagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.

Another moment of laughter surrounded the order of specific questions. Kagan jumped in as Jackson pivoted to another point about the officer/office debate: “Could we — is that OK if we do this and then do that? Will there be an opportunity to do officer stuff or should we–?”

“Absolutely. Absolutely,” Roberts said, diffusing the confusion, as people laughed.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Leah Millis/Reuters

South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects.

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell concluded his initial arguments before the Supreme Court justices after nearly an hour.

Here are some of the key things that happened:

Power of states: Several of the justices from both ideological sides pressed the Trump lawyer about stripping states of their ability to exclude candidates from power, including whether an “admitted insurrectionist” could be removed from the ballot.

Mitchell argued that it was the role of Congress to determine whether someone should be disqualified — so even if a person admits to being an insurrectionist, states have no basis to act. ""Even if the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist, Section 3 (of the 14th Amendment) still allows the candidate to run for office, and even win election for office, and then see whether Congress lifts that disability after the election,"" Mitchell said in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts.

The role of Congress: Mitchell argued that Colorado's decision to remove Trump from the ballot was improper because, among other reasons, the state disqualified Trump before Congress explicitly gave it the power to do that.

The debate over the term ""officer"": The justices pressed Mitchell over whether the framers of the 14th Amendment believed the president is an “officer of” the United States, and therefore subject to the “insurrectionist ban” under Section 3. The argument is a central focus of the former president’s legal team, which believes that when the amendment’s framers wrote “officer,” they meant lower federal officials appointed by the president – not the president himself.

That discussion led to this particularly intense exchange:

“For an insurrection, there needs to be an organized, concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence,” Mitchell said.

“A chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection?” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked.

Mitchell responded: “This was a riot. It was not an insurrection.”

What happens next for Trump's legal team: Mitchell will have an opportunity to make brief rebuttal arguments to the justices at the end of the hearing, after lawyers for the Colorado voters and secretary of state finish presenting their case.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

Introduces a new process in which US Citizenship and Immigration Services would decide an asylum claim without it going through the immigration court system. The process doesn’t apply to unaccompanied migrant children.

We spoke to Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor and author of the new book, “Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away With It,” for a refresher on how grand juries and indictments work. Part of our conversation, conducted by phone, is below:

Grand jury vs. trial jury

WOLF: What should we know about the difference between a grand jury and a trial jury?

HONIG: A grand jury decides to indict, meaning to charge a case. A trial jury determines guilt or non-guilt.

A grand jury is bigger, typically 23 members, and the prosecutor only needs the votes of a majority of a grand jury — as opposed to a trial jury, which has to be unanimous.

The standard of proof in a grand jury is lower than a trial jury. In a grand jury, you only have to show probable cause, meaning more likely than not. But of course in a trial setting, you need to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The other thing to know is a grand jury is an almost entirely one-sided process.

Usually the only people allowed in the room at all are the grand jurors, the prosecutors, the witnesses and a court reporter.

In some instances, including New York, there’s a limited right of a potential defendant to present some evidence, but no defense lawyers are allowed in the room.

There’s no cross-examination of the prosecution’s evidence. There’s no presentation of defense evidence.

Close to every time a prosecutor seeks an indictment from a grand jury, he or she will get an indictment from the grand jury.

What is an indictment?

WOLF: How would you define “indictment”?

HONIG: It’s a document setting forth formal charges against the defendant.

3 Trump grand juries

WOLF: We have three grand juries that are top of mind — for election meddling in Georgia, at the federal level for declassified documents and then the Manhattan DA. How much variation is there in grand juries between city, county and federal?

HONIG: There are minor variations, but the basics remain the same.

Here’s an example of one of the minor variations in New York State, but not in the federal system, meaning for DOJ. The defendant does have some limited right to be notified and given a chance to testify or present defense evidence, which we saw play out with Trump and then him asking Robert Costello to testify.

That’s not the case federally. You do not have to give a defendant a chance to testify or present evidence. That’s one slight variation. But the basic fundamentals are the same.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.

Trump’s victory there is a reversal of his fortunes in the 2016 GOP nominating contest, when he lost Idaho to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But Haley’s appeals to moderate Republicans were not a fit with one of the nation’s most conservative states, and in caucuses in which only registered Republicans were allowed to vote.

Because he is on track to receive more than 50% of the vote, Trump will win all 32 of Idaho’s delegates to the Republican National Convention. The state divides its delegates on a proportional basis only if no candidate tops the 50% mark.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Go Nakamura/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday stoked fears about migrants coming into the United States as railed against President Joe Biden and his border policies as he stood feet from the US-Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump attempted to tie crime in the US to recent increases in immigration — what he calls it “migrant crime” — despite there being little evidence indicating a connection between immigration and crime. Many researchers actually argue immigrants are less likely to commit crimes.

The former president said he spoke on Wednesday to the parents of 22-year-old Laken Riley, who was found dead after jogging on the University of Georgia campus. Trump has repeatedly invoked Riley’s death as he pushes for his hardline immigration policies because her suspected killer is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.

“These are the people that are coming into our country, and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institution and they're coming from insane asylums and they're terrorists. They're being led into our country. And it's horrible,” Trump said as he repeated the typical anti-immigrant rhetoric he uses on the campaign trail.

The former president praised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tried to implement a new controversial security initiative. The US Supreme Court recently allowed US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Abbott’s initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.

Trump’s trip to the border comes not long after Trump torpedoed a bipartisan border bill so he could continue campaigning on Biden’s perceived weakness on the border.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

This post has been updated with additional details on Biden's physical.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Former President Donald Trump will win South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, further tightening his grip on the nomination and leaving his last remaining major rival Nikki Haley to consider her dwindling options.

The former president has swept all GOP nominating contests to date, first beating the field by large margins in Iowa and New Hampshire, before cleaning up in Nevada, where Haley didn’t appear on the ballot, and in the US Virgin Islands.

Trump’s victory now places the onus on Haley, the former South Carolina governor who doubled down earlier this week in a speech, declaring, “I’m not going anywhere.”

The next stop on the GOP nominating calendar is Michigan, where Republicans will vote in a primary Tuesday. After a few m ore scattered contests, March 5 will bring Super Tuesday – and an opportunity for Trump to draw even closer to wrapping up his third consecutive party nomination.

Defeated on her home turf, Haley’s already struggling campaign is likely to come under renewed pressure from Republicans who want her to drop out and allow Trump to focus exclusively on his likely rematch with President Joe Biden, who won the Palmetto State’s Democratic primary earlier this month with more than 96% of the vote.

Sam Wolfe/Reuters

Former President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”

Trump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.

Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.

If the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.

If the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, defeating Nikki Haley on her home turf as he completed his sweep of the early voting states.

The race accelerates now: The slow march through the early voting states is over, and the primary is now a national one. By March 12, 56% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention will have been awarded. And in most states, Republicans’ delegates are winner-take-all — which means Haley gets no credit for strong second-place showings. With Haley winless so far, the finish line — 1,215 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination — could be in sight for Trump within weeks.

Trump dominates the GOP establishment — again: In case it wasn’t clear when he won the nomination in 2016, became president, ran all but a select few Republican critics out of office or the party, then stormed into the 2024 race despite facing multiple indictments: The GOP belongs to Donald Trump. Trump's success in Haley’s home state underscores how much has changed in less than a decade. Nor has it been a hostile takeover, no matter how hostile Trump can be toward his rivals: Most Republican voters are all in on Trump, and the parts of his personality that make establishment Republicans cringe are — as we’ve seen — actually a large part of his appeal to a majority of voters.

Where does Haley go from here? There was once a narrow, but tantalizing, path for Haley to seriously challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. It started with winning in New Hampshire and her home state. But that potentially game-changing stretch of the Republican primary race is over. Following Saturday's projected loss, Haley's campaign announced a swing through Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah starting Sunday, and she’s also spending money on advertising targeting Super Tuesday states. Whether she’ll actually notch any wins and begin to seriously challenge Trump in the delegate race, though, is a tougher question.

A big enough pro-Haley coalition doesn't exist in GOP primaries: Haley’s campaign has long touted general election polls that show her in a much stronger position than Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Biden. But she can’t skip the step of defeating Trump in a primary first. There’s long been a theoretical coalition for Haley that includes moderate Republicans, independents allowed to vote in Republican primaries in some states and those turned off by Trump — particularly suburban, college-educated voters who have fled the party since Trump’s ascension in 2016. But that coalition isn’t showing up for Haley in the primary — at least not in enough force.

Tim Scott's veepstakes audition: The most important result of South Carolina’s primary might be the cozy relationship Trump seemed to develop with his onetime 2024 GOP primary rival, Sen. Tim Scott. The last few weeks may have served as Scott’s audition for the vice presidential nomination. He campaigned with Trump, appeared alongside him in a Fox News town hall and other interviews, and urged Haley — who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor — to get out of the race.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

That was a theme that the justices returned to repeatedly, underscoring a push by the court's conservatives to limit the power of federal agencies in recent years.

Meanwhile, the court's three liberals focused on the idea that rifles equipped with bump stocks effectively work like machine guns and can do similar damage if misused.

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The final polls in Michigan closed just over an hour ago, but the two projected winners are already clear.

CNN has projected President Joe Biden will win Michigan’s Democratic primary and former President Donald Trump will win the state’s Republican primary.

Biden is on a glide course to the Democratic nomination for a second term, while the former president barrels toward the GOP nod for the third straight election.

Trump’s win further shuts the door on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s hopes of building momentum ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday contests, when more than one-third of the party’s delegates are at stake.

Here’s a look at the latest vote tally:

Republican presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Trump: 66.7%

Haley: 28.4%

Democratic presidential primary, with about 22% of the estimated vote in:

Biden: 79.7%

Uncommitted: 14.5%

Marianne Williamson: 2.9%

Dean Phillips: 2.8%

Judge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.

“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.

Here are key takeaways from the decision:

The biggest fines yet against Trump: Engoron found that the defendants’ fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount. He also ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, and that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx. Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments.

Engoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments. The judge gets the last word: Trump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom – and even to the judge’s face while he testified. On Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a “pathological” fraudster who would not stop unless forced. The judge acknowledged that the sins Trump committed — which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump’s company — were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.

But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition. No corporate death penalty: The judge banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty. Engoron pulled back from a decision he issued a summary judgment in September dissolving Trump’s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud. But, the independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years and an independent director of compliance should be put in place at the Trump Org. at the company’s expense, the ruling said.

Judge says Cohen told the truth: Engoron recapped Michael Cohen’s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump’s former lawyer and fixer. But ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.

Trump’s adult sons banned for 2 years: Trump’s eldest sons – who’ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 – are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron’s order. The Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company.

Here's what they had to say:

On the Alabama IVF ruling: Katie Alexander, who said she underwent IVF to get pregnant with her daughter, said she thought the Alabama Supreme Court ruling frozen embryos were children was a “dangerous slippery slope.""

“It makes it very, very muddy,"" she said of the ruling, calling for new laws on the procedure to be passed.

On Trump using campaign funds to pay for legal fees: Some supporters were split on whether Trump should be using campaign funds to pay for his legal bills.

“Well, I don’t know what the laws are but I will tell you that people who donate to Trump’s campaign would have no problem with him using the money to pay some of his bills. I really believe that,” Carolyn Corcoran said.

Barbara Gobien said, “It doesn’t matter to me if they want to use it.”

Ruth Carroll expressed distrust in media reports and said she'd need to see proof first of Trump using campaign fees for his bills. But when asked if hypothetically it would be something she would support, Carroll said she would not.

On Trump’s NATO comments: Some supporters said they thought Trump wasn’t being serious when he encouraged Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO countries that didn’t meet spending guidelines, and believed the US would still protect those countries if Trump were reelected.

“He says things in a kind of way that people just don’t understand,"" Corcoran said. ""But I don’t take what he says as meaning anything serious.”

But Barbara Gobien, said she agreed with Trump’s comments.

“Nobody should be allowed to be part of anything if they don’t pay their share and too many countries have lived off our backs and it’s about time that changed,” Gobien said. “Trump’s the first person that made that statement and he started getting people to pay their fair share.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 1,508 interviews with Republican primary voters across 38 different polling places on Election Day. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Andrew Harnik/AP

President Joe Biden “continues to be fit for duty” after his annual physical was conducted at Walter Reed, Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo Wednesday, adding that there are “no new concerns” from this year’s physical.

“The President feels well and this year’s physical identified no new concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,"" the doctor said.

O’Conner concluded his letter: “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

Earlier Wednesday, Biden joked about his age while telling reporters about his annual physical. “They think I look too young,” Biden said, adding that there was nothing different from last year’s physical.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president to have held the office. He would be 86 years old at the end of a potential second term. He has been persistently dogged by criticism and concerns over his age and stamina. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released earlier this month, 46% of Democrats were concerned about his age.

The White House said the doctor assessed that the president “doesn’t need a cognitive test.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president’s physician was “happy” with how the president’s annual physical went.

A cognitive test has not been part of a standard presidential physical. If Biden or his doctor had a specific concern, his doctor could perform a brief assessment that might determine whether further evaluation is recommended.

When the president has received his physical in the past, his physician — Dr. Kevin O’Connor — has issued a report on the president’s health. Presidents are under no legal requirement to release information about their health and can choose which details are made public.

Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House.

The former president’s first criminal trial will take place later this month in a courtroom in New York, where he faces charges stemming from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.

The trial start date in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case revisited the timing of the trial during a key hearing on March 1. She has not yet set a new date for the trial.

The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set, though prosecutors have proposed August 5. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges.

The judge overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump’s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court’s resolution of Trump’s claims. The justices will hear arguments in the case next month.

Meanwhile, the GOP primary is well underway, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will already know the former president’s fate in at least one of his four criminal cases.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

While some vocal supporters of this movement say they will never vote for Biden, and intend to leave their ballots blank in November rather than vote for Biden or Donald Trump, others are more pragmatic and hope their protest votes prompt a policy change from the administration.

“We are moving in the traditions of anti-war protestors who came before us,” said Abbas Alawieh, a spokesman for Listen to Michigan, who called for a moment of silence for the children killed in Gaza. “Stop killing our families, that’s all we’re asking for.”

Even as the votes were still being counted Tuesday night, organizers of Listen to Michigan deemed their campaign a success.

“We demand President Biden to take action now — bring a permanent ceasefire,” said Layla Elabed, the campaign manager for the group. “A vote 'uncommitted' was a humanitarian vote.”

She said the effort was just beginning, with plans to keep pressure alive on the president in the eight months until the November election.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

“I think [Hunter Biden] may be a little bit frustrated by some of the double standards relating to Jared Kushner and money that has been just openly pocketed by Donald Trump in office and Jared Kushner, of course, brought back $2 billion from Saudi Arabia. And all of that has been part of the conversation and he was assertive about that,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.

Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman echoed, “I thought one of his most powerful lines is when he made it very clear that none of the business dealings that he ever had were with any government entity, and he pointed out, unlike Jared Kushner has received $2 billion from the Saudi Arabian government as soon as he left office when he was the point person on Middle East policy.”

Goldman said, “We all noticed, I think, that there were some Republicans nodding their head, when Hunter suggested that it would be worth investigating Jared Kushner and his $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.”

Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said after the president’s son posed the question of why Republicans were not curious about Kushner’s business dealings with Saudi Arabia, “for the first time, some Republicans in the room said, ‘No, we have a problem with that.'”

Raskin said he understood why the president’s son wanted to testify publicly, given how forthright he has been in his answers.

“I understand why Hunter Biden wanted to testify in public because I think he would answer all of the questions that the public has based on all of his propaganda to everybody's satisfaction, and I understand why our Republican colleagues didn't want him to testify in public,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

As the evidentiary hearing got under way, an attorney for the Fulton County district attorney’s office told the judge that the entire motion over whether District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified ought to be dismissed.

Adam Abbate told the judge: “We’ve been able to determine that the claims the defendant has … are not only legally meritless” but are also “patiently false.”

The judge, Scott McAfee, denied Abbate’s renewed effort to stop the hearing.

Abbate argued that the testimony of one of the key witnesses in the case, Terrence Bradley, would be blocked by attorney-client privilege. Bradley represented Nathan Wade in his divorce proceedings. In this hearing, McAfee will consider allegations that Willis and Wade, he top prosecutor, engaged in a romantic relationship.

“We’d ask to renew our motion to quash,” Abbate said.

Ashleigh Merchant, the defense attorney who brought the claims against Wade and Willis, argued that the hearing should continue. “Let’s hear from some witnesses, judge,” Merchant said. “This is a very important issue and we need to have witnesses.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Brendan McDermid/Pool via Reuters

Before entering the courtroom in New York on Thursday morning, Trump claimed the hush money case against him is “election interference.” He also argued that it is interfering with his ability to campaign in South Carolina ahead of the February 24 Republican presidential primary there.

“How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long? I’m supposed to be in South Carolina right now, where other people are, and where, again — this is where I should be. I shouldn’t be in a courthouse,” Trump said.

Trump was even more explicit in comments after leaving the courtroom later in the morning, saying, “So instead of being in South Carolina and other states, campaigning, I’m stuck here.”

Facts First: Trump wasn’t “stuck” in the courthouse in New York on Thursday. In fact, he was not required to attend any part of the hearing, since Judge Juan Merchan had waived his pretrial appearances.

Rather, Trump voluntarily chose to appear at the hearing after considering instead attending a hearing related to charges he faces in Georgia.

And he had not been scheduled to be in South Carolina on Thursday even before he made the decision to attend the New York hearing. His next scheduled campaign appearance in the state is next week. His next rally after the Thursday hearing is a Saturday event in Michigan.

Trump is not planning to fly to South Carolina after the New York hearing. He is planning to fly back to Florida, where he lives.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on February 16, in Atlanta. Alyssa Pointer/Pool/Getty Images

John Floyd, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ father, testified Friday that he taught his daughter to “hide cash” in case she needed it.

“What I told my child from the time she was a child was always have some money,” Floyd said, adding that he told her to always have “six months of cash always.”

Defense attorneys had pushed Willis over why she would keep a prevalence of cash in her home, which she said used to pay Nathan Wade back for various expenses. Floyd’s testimony corroborates Willis’ statements that she was taught to always have cash handy.

“Maybe, and excuse me your honor, I’m not trying to be racist, but it’s a black thing,” Floyd said. “I was trained, and most black folks, they hide cash or they keep cash, and I was trained you always keep some cash.”

“I gave my daughter her first cash box and told her, ‘always keep some cash,’” Floyd said.

Floyd referenced a time he had trouble paying for his meal at a restaurant several years ago to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“I had a American Express credit card and maybe a Visa,” Floyd said, as well as “a lot of what they call traveler’s checks.”

“For whatever reasons the man would not take my American Express credit card,” Floyd said. “So, I pulled out my Visa card, and he wouldn’t take my Visa card. So then I pulled out my traveler’s checks, and he said ‘we don’t take checks.’""

“The bill for my wife at the time … Fani and myself was like $9.95, I had a $10 bill. And I always remember that,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The electorate that Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are battling to win in South Carolina looks much more like Iowa than New Hampshire, according to the initial results of CNN’s exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary.

As in the Iowa caucuses, well over four in 10 of South Carolina primary voters describe themselves as affiliated with the MAGA movement, the exit poll finds. Roughly eight in 10 say they’re conservatives, with more than four in 10 calling themselves very conservative. And only about one-third acknowledge that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor of the 2020 presidential election — similar to Iowa, but lower than in New Hampshire, where nearly half of primary voters acknowledged Biden’s victory.

The exit poll also shows most South Carolina GOP primary voters made up their minds before 2024 even started. More than three-quarters say they decided whom they would support for president sometime prior to January, and fewer than one-tenth say they made up their mind in the week prior to voting.

While voters’ decisions are often too complex to be reduced to any single issue or candidate attribute, the exit poll provides some clues to which topics gained traction in the campaign. Slightly below four in 10 primary voters say they were most looking for a candidate who would fight for them, with another third saying they wanted someone who would share their values, and fewer prioritizing temperament or electability.

More about the exit polls: They are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven't yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the type of voters turning out to participate. The exit poll for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool.

Junfu Han/Detroit Free Press/USA Today Network

A Michigan court has affirmed the removal of Kristina Karamo as the state’s Republican Party chair, in a move that could settle a bitter leadership dispute just days before the party’s convention this weekend.

In a preliminary injunction issued Tuesday, Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi said Karamo was properly removed from her position on January 6, when Michigan’s GOP state committee voted to oust her, and that any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.”

Tuesday’s ruling, a copy of which was published by NBC News, also prevents Karamo from representing herself as chair of the Michigan Republican State Committee or conducting business on behalf of the party.

Tuesday’s development was a victory for Pete Hoekstra, a former ambassador and representative who has been recognized by the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump as the rightful chair of the Michigan Republican Party.

The Michigan GOP is set to hold its convention on Saturday, when it will allocate the state’s delegates for the Republican National Convention. Karamo had planned a rival convention, potentially complicating the process.

CNN previously reported that under Karamo’s leadership, the Michigan GOP suffered from internal strife and lackluster finances. A CNN investigation published in late 2023 found the party’s financial problems had become so bad that an internal report revealed the state party had a net income of just $71,000 over a nine-month period that ended with it $600,000 in debt.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The rest will be awarded at a state party convention Saturday. Former President Donald Trump defeated GOP rival Nikki Haley in the primary.

The split contests are the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in their new lineup.

Republicans opposed an earlier Michigan primary, which violated Republican National Committee rules limiting which states can hold contests before March 1. After Democrats, who control the legislature and the governor’s office, moved the Michigan primary to February 27 despite the Republican opposition, the RNC and the Michigan GOP came up with the hybrid model.

Further complicating matters: The Michigan GOP is in the middle of a battle over who actually leads the party, with two people who claim to be the party’s leaders scheduling dueling conventions Saturday. The RNC and Trump have recognized Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman and US ambassador to the Netherlands, as chair; Hoekstra scheduled a Saturday convention in Grand Rapids. However, Kristina Karamo, the election conspiracy theorist who the state party voted to oust in January, has refused to relinquish control, arguing she was unlawfully removed. She has planned a convention in Detroit.

Kent County Circuit Court Judge J. Joseph Rossi on Tuesday affirmed Karamo’s removal as state party chair, saying any actions she has taken since then on behalf of the party were “void and have no effect.” She has not yet said whether the convention she planned for Detroit would go forward. Regardless of Karamo’s actions, the RNC’s decision to recognize Hoekstra signaled the party would accept delegates from the convention he will oversee.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

It was the 29th oldest state in 2001, but the 14th oldest by 2021, according to the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics. The share of residents aged 55 and older is expected to increase by 14% between 2021 and 2050.

That demographic trend is spurring growth in the state’s health care industry — both for workers and facilities, said Brian Peters, CEO of the Michigan Health & Hospital Association.

Health care is already the state’s largest employer, with more than 500,000 jobs at the end of 2023. But there are at least 27,000 job openings in hospitals for workers at all levels. One rural hospital recently had to temporarily close its cafeteria because of a lack of staff, Peters said. Many nurses and other clinicians are also approaching retirement age, which increases the pressure to hire.

The need will only grow as more Michigan residents hit their senior years.

“Those folks who are headed off to their retirement days, they are the ones who demand more health care services,” Peters said, noting that outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, rehab and skilled nursing facilities and specialty doctors’ offices and other providers are all expanding.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Tom Brenner/AFP/Getty Images

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is overseeing one of the smallest House majorities in history – and Democrat Tom Suozzi’s win in a New York special election will shrink it further.

Suozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in a race for the seat previously held by former GOP Rep. George Santos who was expelled from Congress last year.

When Suozzi is sworn in, Republicans will control 219 seats and Democrats will control 213. With a breakdown of 219 to 213, House Republicans will only be able to lose only two votes to pass legislation on party-line votes if all members are present and voting

After the swearing in, there will be three vacancies in the House. Former New York Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins resigned from Congress earlier this month, former Ohio GOP Rep. Bill Johnson resigned last month and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy resigned at the end of last year.

In addition to the tight margin, there is always the possibility that absences could further impact the vote math. The razor-thin majority presents an enormous challenge for the speaker, leaving Johnson with almost no room for error as he navigates demands from competing wings of his party.

Hardline conservatives have already shown they can hold major sway in the chamber with such a narrow majority – most notably when a group of hardliners moved to oust McCarthy from the speakership in a historic vote last year.

Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal dismissed concerns over the potential weakness of President Joe Biden’s electoral coalition — which has faced challenges amid concerns from Arab Americans and progressives over the administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

""I think the Biden coalition is strong, alive and well and focused on the basic accomplishments of this administration, as it will be on election day. I am very, very hopeful that a pause can diminish some of the apparent friction involved in that coalition, but I think it will hold together,"" the senator from Connecticut told CNN.

His comments come ahead of today’s Democratic primary in Michigan where there has been an organized effort, including by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian American, to send a message to the Biden campaign by urging voters to vote ""uncommitted.""

Blumenthal’s emphasis on a potential pause in the fighting in Gaza, which Biden said could possibly be reached as early as the end of this upcoming weekend, illustrates the ongoing political ramifications of the war.

Blumenthal also added that he’s ""very concerned"" about a government shutdown, pointing to its possible catastrophic consequences. ""It takes people focus on the real end game here which is not unnecessary and frivolous riders to prove a point or make a political stunt,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

There was a muted response in the room of Nikki Haley’s campaign party when CNN projected that Donald Trump would win the South Carolina primary — until the former president started speaking.

A man started waving a South Carolina loves Nikki Haley sign in front of the projection of Trump speaking, and moments later chants for Haley broke out.

“I don’t think it is over,” Nell Parker, a Haley supporter in the room told CNN. Parker said she plans to rally North Carolina for Haley, and feels good about her odds going forward.

“We are for anyone against Trump,” said another Haley supporter in the room.

Others said they did not trust the projection, and were frustrated about polls generally.

No one in the room said they believe this is the beginning of the end for Haley.

The Haley campaign say they feel that they did everything they could to effectively compete in South Carolina, but aides said frustrations arose throughout the last month given the strong hold that Trump has on the state. For example, the Republican group at Clemson University endorsed Trump, which was frustrating for Haley’s team given the school is her alma mater.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Michigan state Rep. Alabas Farhat is voting ""uncommitted"" in today's primary to send a message to President Joe Biden to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and urge him to live up to his campaign promises from 2020.

""I want to make it clear that today's vote is an appeal to the White House, it is an appeal to President Biden to be the leader that we know he can, a leader that he promised the nation he would be in 2020, when he campaigned saying that he was going to restore dignity and humanity to the White House,"" the Democratic representative from Michigan's 3rd District told CNN.

Farhat said that there are thousands of Michiganders who are watching the atrocities overseas with horror and anguish. They're watching ""their loved ones dying, children starving to death and they're hearing the screams of parents who are holding their children, their lifeless children,"" he said. He said the coalition wants to see an effort toward restoring humanitarian aid and lasting peace.

Farhat added that the push to vote uncommitted during the primary will probably not impact Biden winning, but those involved are building a diverse coalition to show the White House that there is a unified message calling for a ceasefire.

""The message though is that a plurality of voters, Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Gen Z voters are coming together — African American voters are coming together in a coalition to tell the president that, 'Hey, we want — we want to see you call for the ceasefire.

The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.

Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.

Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.

Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9. The trial is currently set to start in May.

In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.

Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.

Two of the Big Three companies, GM and Chrysler, went bankrupt in 2009 and needed federal bailouts to survive.

That took a bite not only out of employment, but out of auto wages, as the United Auto Workers union agreed to deep concessions, including a lower tier of wages, to help keep all three companies alive. But that helped drag down wages in the state overall.

The state’s median household income was higher than the national average until 2000, according to the Growing Michigan Together Council, a group formed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to develop solutions to Michigan’s challenges. The state’s median income declined relative to the US level over the past five decades.

Today, the median household income in the state was just under $67,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau.

However, following a six-week strike last fall at GM, Ford and Stellantis, the United Auto Workers union won immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members. Pay for members is expected to rise more than 30% during the life of the contract, which expires in 2028.

While jobs in the state’s auto and parts plants have stabilized in recent years, jobs in the manufacturing sector overall have edged up by 4.5% since the end of 2020. But that still hasn’t recaptured jobs lost in that sector during the first year of the pandemic. Overall employment in the state in December was up 9.6% from the end of 2020, but still off 0.5% from December of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic.

Rebecca Cook/Reuters

President Joe Biden is the heavy favorite to win tonight’s Democratic primary in Michigan. But that hasn’t stopped those who believe he should be pushing harder for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas from organizing a vote for “uncommitted.”

That is, a vote in the primary for “uncommitted” is a protest vote against Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza. It’s not clear how well this effort will do, but a high percentage of support could suggest general election trouble for Biden in the Wolverine State.

Take a look at the 2020 Republican presidential primaries: President Donald Trump romped to wins everywhere with 94% of the vote nationally, but his weakest region (or census subdivision) by far was New England. He was under 90% of the primary vote in all those states and even came in with less than 80% in Connecticut. In the general election, all the New England states swung against Trump by about 2 to 4 times as much as the swing against him nationally compared with 2016.

In the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, we saw a somewhat similar phenomenon. President Barack Obama won about 90% of the vote nationally. He got below 60% of the primary vote in a line of states from Oklahoma to Arkansas to Kentucky to West Virginia.

All four were among the six states that swung the most toward the Republican candidate on the presidential level from 2004 to 2012.

It’s not exactly clear what a low level of support tonight for Biden would be. Still, he got over 95% of the vote in South Carolina and nearly 90% in Nevada. If he falls significantly short of those levels, it could be ominous.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA/AP

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of House progressives, said the number of ""uncommitted"" votes in Michigan is a major warning sign for President Joe Biden in November.

“This is exactly what I warned about several months ago,” Jayapal told CNN. “The war on Gaza is a deep moral issue and the lack of attention and empathy for this perspective from the administration is breaking apart the fragile coalition we built to elect Joe Biden in 2020.”

Jayapal says there is “still a little bit of time to change this dynamic.” But she added: “It has to be a dramatic policy and rhetorical shift from the president on this issue and a new strategy to rebuild a real partnership with progressives in multiple communities who are absolutely key to winning the election.”

Organizers of the movement to vote ""uncommitted"" had hoped at least 10,000 people would cast their vote for the cause, a nod to the 10,700-vote margin that delivered the state to Donald Trump in 2016. They had far surpassed that goal just before 11 p.m. Tuesday night.

One of the leading voices in the campaign to vote “uncommitted,” former Democratic US Rep. Andy Levin, said the early numbers show a “historic” result. He said he felt the effort was a success in conveying people's anger to the president.

Levin’s message to voters who are mad about the war in Gaza was: “Don't stay home, don't stay home. Go out and shake your fist. Go to the ballot box and tell the president you're mad otherwise, he won’t know.”

Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to convince Judge Aileen Cannon that she will need to hold a hearing on their request for more discovery from several agencies and the White House.

Their request depends on an argument that officials from those agencies were advising prosecutors on prosecutorial decisions that essentially make them members of the prosecution team.

Cannon seemed open to the idea of holding a hearing, but pressed Trump attorney Emil Bove on what such a hearing would focus on and how it would work. Bove pointed to several examples of what he said was collaboration between multiple government agencies like the National Archives and the White House.

Bove added that a hearing where prosecutors would address some of these arguments would have to take place in a secure location, especially since it would touch on how classified material in the case was reviewed.

Prosecutors denied these claims of inter-agency collaboration earlier in the hearing.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Momentum to plot a swift impeachment of Mayorkas picked up steam last month as key swing-district Republicans expressed openness to the idea amid a recent surge of migrant crossings at the southern border.

Border authorities encountered more than 225,000 migrants along the US-Mexico border in December, marking the highest monthly total recorded since 2000, according to preliminary Homeland Security statistics shared with CNN. And in fiscal year 2022, according to the Department of Homeland Security, 1.4 million individuals who were encountered at the border were removed, which is more than in any previous year.

The border crisis has galvanized Republicans, unifying their party for more aggressive action on an issue central to the 2024 campaign, and a handful of the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to scuttle an effort to impeach Mayorkas in November 2023 recently signaled they’d back impeaching him if it went through the committee process, which happened late last month.

Moderate Republicans, including ones in districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020, also signaled more willingness to impeach Mayorkas than the president – a sign of the shifting political terrain on the issue.

While House Republicans have sought to use Mayorkas' impeachment to address their issues with Biden's handling of the border, the GOP also helped to tank – along with Donald Trump – a major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package that would have marked a tough change to immigration law championed by one of the Senate's most conservative members. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber, even if it ever made it out of the Senate.

Mayorkas wrote in a letter in advance of the vote that “the problems with our broken and outdated immigration system are not new” and called on Congress to help provide a legislative solution to the “historically divisive issue.”

In 2020, Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American activist and longtime Michigan Democrat, backed Joe Biden for president. But like many Arab Americans, she feels betrayed by his response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the rising civilian death toll. Biden would need to curtail US military aid to Israel and call for a permanent ceasefire before she could even consider supporting him in November, she said.

And as for Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Michigan, she’s leading the charge to convince Democrats to vote “uncommitted.” Elabed is the effort’s campaign manager and the sister of Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman in Congress.

The Listen to Michigan campaign was launched less than three weeks ago by Elabed and other Arab American activists in the Wolverine State. It’s a last-minute effort to send a “clear, sharp message” to Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party to address the concerns of the coalition that helped him win in 2020, Elabed said.

Since its launch, the effort has been endorsed by progressive groups such as Our Revolution and more than three dozen current and former state and local leaders, including Tlaib and former US Rep. Andy Levin. Volunteers have contacted more than 100,000 voters in the state, according to organizers.

The president’s reelection campaign has responded to the Listen to Michigan effort by emphasizing Biden’s domestic accomplishments, framing the general election as a binary choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump and stressing that the administration is listening to people’s concerns and open to future conversations.

Why this matters: If thousands of Michigan Democrats vote uncommitted Tuesday, it would be the clearest sign yet that Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza could cost him critical votes in November. Arab and Muslim Americans make up a substantial voting bloc in Michigan, a key battleground state.

The attorneys will likely have to return in the next few weeks to discuss outstanding issues, including whether Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor Willis hired to lead the case, can still assert attorney-client privilege over some testimony and evidence from his former law partner and divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors also will have the opportunity to file additional legal briefs as they see fit.

The evidentiary hearing included a tumultuous two days of testimony, including from Willis herself. Before the hearing concluded, the district attorney’s office sought to undermine Bradley’s credibility, including by raising an allegation of sexual assault by an employee of his former law firm. Bradley denied the allegation.

Bradley testified earlier Friday that he left the firm following a “disagreement,” but said the details of the disagreement were privileged. During cross examination, Bradley was pressed on whether he left because of a disagreement over a sexual assault allegation made against him.

“That is not correct,” Bradley said, but confirmed that he was accused of sexually assaulting a member of the firm.

The judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, questioned whether Bradley had been properly interpreting the privilege he had previously asserted over communications with Wade, given his testimony on the allegation.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Dieu-Nalio Chery/Reuters

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to win handily in their respective contests, but there will be lessons to learn for both.

Here’s what to watch for in Michigan:

The first ballot test of Biden’s Israel strategy: Biden’s support for Israel – whose war in Gaza has killed roughly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry – has enraged American progressives, many of them Jewish, and Arab Americans. The Michigan city of Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. That anger is fueling a statewide movement among Democratic critics of Israel for voters to mark “uncommitted” on their ballots. Just how committed are Michigan Democrats to Biden? Tuesday will tell.

A fractured and confusing GOP process: The split process of awarding delegates between a Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday and a state party convention on Saturday is the result of Republicans’ reaction to Democrats’ decision to shake up the party’s presidential nominating calendar after the 2020 election — demoting Iowa and New Hampshire, moving South Carolina and Nevada to the forefront and placing Michigan third in its new lineup.

Tests for Biden, Trump: Biden is banking on an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, support from Black voters, and a stronger Democratic infrastructure — with an electorate energized by an abortion rights battle delivering Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her party victories up and down the ballot in 2022. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping to re-engineer the White working-class coalition that helped him break down the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016.

The conservative group, which pledged to back a single contender in the GOP presidential primary for the first time in its history, deployed its vast resources and standing army of activists on behalf of the former United Nations ambassador.

But while the race has come down to Haley and Trump, the former president remains the dominant front-runner after a strong victory in Haley’s home state on Saturday.

Americans for Prosperity President and CEO Emily Seidel emphasized that AFP Action is still standing with Haley, even if it’s no longer spending to boost her campaign, writing in the email that she “has shown us again and again that we made the right decision in supporting her candidacy and she continues to have our strong endorsement.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Gary Peters heads to the floor of the Senate for a vote on Capitol Hill on February 11, in Washington, DC. Samuel Corum/Getty Images

Sen. Gary Peters, the chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm who hails from Michigan, downplayed the progressive-led effort to vote “uncommitted” in Tuesday’s primary as a form of protest over President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

“I'm not sure what we'll see tonight, we'll be watching that number. But it's certainly not unusual for people to vote uncommitted,” Peters told CNN, ticking off the number of uncommitted votes in previous cycles, including when Barack Obama was president and ran unopposed.

Asked if he harbors any concerns about cracks in Biden’s coalition, Peters said: “No, no, I don't see that. But we'll continue to hold that together and continue to be strong. You know, if you look at former President Trump — he has an opponent taking 40% in primaries away from him. To me that's more significant.”

However, others in the party have expressed concern about the organized “uncommitted” effort — led in part by Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — even as they say they respect the views of voters and acknowledge it’s imperative for Biden to hear out their concerns in a key battleground state.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the other Michigan senator, said on CNN earlier today she thinks the campaign to urge voters to vote uncommitted is “certainly not helpful.”

And one House Democrat told CNN there is “massive” frustration inside the party over the effort, worried it could backfire if it winds up helping get Trump elected. “The president is weak enough without hobbling him more with a concerted campaign against him,” the lawmaker told CNN.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on February 15, in Atlanta, Georgia Alyssa Pointer/Pool/Getty Images

Several advisers and confidants of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis privately urged her in recent weeks to encourage top prosecutor Nathan Wade voluntarily step aside, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.

Willis is being advised by people inside and outside of the district attorney’s office, though one source said there is a difference of legal opinions about what to do next.

Willis and Wade have so far resisted the push for him to resign from the Georgia election subversion case, a stance that the two reinforced in their defiant testimony Thursday in an Atlanta-area courtroom where they pushed back on allegations that their now-ended romantic relationship created a disqualifying conflict of interest.

CNN previously reported that Willis had no plans to recuse herself from the case after allegations surfaced that she and Wade engaged in an improper romantic relationship. Sources familiar with the situation said prior to Thursday’s hearing that Wade also did not have immediate plans to step away from the case either but acknowledged his future was more uncertain.

Wade is interchangeable and could be replaced without forcing the case to be assigned to another prosecutor's office, multiple sources familiar with the situation stressed before and after he testified on Thursday.

Privately, Wade has told others working on the Georgia election case he does not want to be a distraction, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

It remains unclear if Wade’s testimony has moved the needle at all in terms of the likelihood he resigns. A spokesperson for the district attorney’s office declined to comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

In a report released Thursday, Special Counsel Robert Hur did not recommend charges against Biden over his handling of classified documents. In his explanation for not recommending prosecution, Hur described the president as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”

Trump, addressing a National Rifle Association rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said Biden did ""a lot"" of the activity related to retaining documents ""when he was at a very young age.""

""He was mentally a little better than he is right now,"" he continued, addressing Biden's mental acuity, something he did not immediately seize on yesterday in the wake of the report.

On any other week, special counsel Robert Hur's writing that President Joe Biden could be perceived as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" would have been a damning portrait of a sitting president.

For Biden, however, the special counsel's comments about his memory came at an even more inopportune moment. On three separate occasions this week, Biden has confused the names of European leaders who died years ago with those who more recently served in office, raising more questions about his mental recall.

In those episodes, Biden was describing an international summit in 2021. He described speaking with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, and French President Francois Mitterrand, who died in 1996.

Only about 45 minutes before the report was released publicly, the White House was working to downplay to slip-ups, saying it’s common for people to misspeak.

“Many people, elected officials…they can misspeak sometimes,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, citing recent examples from House Speaker Mike Johnson and TV host Sean Hannity.

She said in meetings, she had never witnessed Biden confuse names.

Yet the picture Hur painted of Biden in the report went well beyond the occasional mistaken name. He said in interviews, the president did not remember the years he was vice president or when his son Beau died.

Immediately after the report was released, White House officials and Biden's personal lawyer forcefully rejected what they said were inappropriate and incorrect statements about his memory.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Norma Anderson, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to disqualify Donald Trump from office, is a lifelong Republican who has had a storied political career, including stints as the first-ever woman majority leader in both chambers of the Colorado legislature.

“I’m an old-fashioned Republican that believes in strong defense, supporting business, and helping those who don’t know how to help themselves, and less government, and a fair tax base,” Anderson said.

Here are some highlights of her career:

She spent 12 years in the statehouse , before having to leave due to term limits. While there, from 1997 to 1998, she was the majority leader of the lower chamber. After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003.

After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003. Her record: While serving in the Colorado statehouse, Anderson helped enact legislation to improve child literacy and lower the cost of in-state colleges and established a home nursing program with funds from a landmark lawsuit against the large tobacco companies.

Battling Trump – especially in court – comes with acclaim in some circles, and vitriol in others. Anderson said she has received a lot of support from friends and family, except for one or two holdouts who are still die-hard Trump supporters. She said most of her friends weren’t surprised that she got involved in the case.

“I was born four months before FDR was elected,” Anderson said. “I’ve lived through a lot of presidents. Some I liked, some I didn’t. But not one of them caused an insurrection, until Donald Trump.”

Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

A federal appeals court on Tuesday said that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency, flatly rejecting Trump’s arguments that he shouldn’t have to go on trial on federal election subversion charges.

Here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's decision:

Trump’s behavior after the 2020 election could be criminal: The judges made it clear that Trump's actions could be prosecuted in a court of law.

""Vital public interest"" of letting trial proceed weighed heavily on the court: The judges cited the public interest in accountability for potential crimes committed by a former president, and how that overcame Trump’s argument that immunity was necessary to protect the institution of the presidency. They flatly rejected Trump’s claim that his criminal indictment would have a “chilling effect” on future administrations.

Trial timing will be up to the Supreme Court: A key part of Trump’s legal strategy has been to delay his criminal cases until after the 2024 election. Now, the trial's timing will be in the hands of the Supreme Court. If Trump is successful with getting the Supreme Court to hear the appeal, the criminal trial would not resume until after the high court decides what to do with his request for a pause.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Evelyn Hockstein/Re

The Supreme Court appears poised to back former President Donald Trump and fend off a blockbuster challenge to his eligibility to appear on Colorado’s ballot as a presidential candidate in 2024, a move that would extract the justices from one of the most politically fraught appeals in the court’s history.

If Trump is pulled off the ballot in Colorado, Chief Justice John Roberts predicted that other states would eventually attempt to knock other candidates off the ballot. That, he signaled, would be inconsistent with the purpose and history of the 14th Amendment.

“It’ll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,” Roberts said. “That’s a pretty daunting consequence.”

At issue is a provision in the 14th Amendment that bars certain public officials from serving in the government again if they took part in an insurrection. The six Republican and independent voters from Colorado who challenged Trump say his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol makes him ineligible under that “insurrection ban.”

A majority of the conservative justices on the court posed tough questions to the lawyers representing the voters -- including whether the insurrection ban can be enforced without a law first passed by Congress – though it was unclear which route the court might take.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly pressed the attorneys about a 19th century decision from a lower court that suggested it was congress, not states, that must act first on enforcing an insurrection ban.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, on the other hand, stressed the idea that the ban only applies to serving in office – not necessarily running for office.

The amendment’s key provision, Section 3, says in part: “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Steve Womack Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images

House Republicans were exasperated after the stunning defeat of their resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, lobbing some criticism at their own leadership over the fiasco even as they plan to bring the vote back up again when they have better attendance.

GOP Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said it was unwise of leadership to put the bill on the floor not knowing for sure whether it would pass, adding to the perception that House Republicans can’t govern.

“It's hard to sit there and see it, you know, I mean, it's tough. We're in a difficult spot right now,” he said. “If we whipped, we need a better whip. I'm not talking about the person in the job. I'm just saying the whip count. We need to know exactly where we are and we need to be careful not to get out ahead of our skis and put something on the floor that we don't have certainty on.”

Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina also criticized GOP leadership’s strategy on the Mayorkas vote.

“I would have thought they would have known that. I would have thought that would have been basic,” Norman said of the whip count. “They’re good on the other side of knowing that. Is it that hard?”

“But it did happen, it went down, and we live to fight another day,” he said.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene disputed that it was a miscalculation to put the bill on the floor, telling CNN, ""I don’t think it’s a failure at all,"" and warning that the Republicans who voted to sink the impeachment articles would be hearing from voters.

“I’m sure they’ll hear from their constituents. I’m sure they’re probably hearing from them already, but I think they should listen to them,"" the Georgia Republican said.

“I look forward to having Steve Scalise back. Of course, been praying for him this whole time to beat cancer,” she added, referring to the House majority leader who was absent from the vote as he recovers in Louisiana from a stem cell transplant.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Eduardo Munoz/Reuters/FILE

After turning several recent trials and court hearings into campaign stops, Donald Trump is not expected to be in the room when the highest court in the land takes up the question of his ballot eligibility, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN.

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

While many legal experts believe Trump could prevail on the ballot challenges issue, his appearance could be considered disruptive to the normally staid and above-the-fray decorum of the Supreme Court.

Trump and his team have treated various court appearances as opportunities for him to cry “election interference,” call out who he deems “Trump-hating” judges and attack the system as rigged “political persecution.” His presence and the attendant

Since the Supreme Court first convened in 1790, 116 justices have served on the bench. Of those, 108 have been White men.

But in recent decades the court has become more diverse. Over half of its appointed justices since 1990 have been women or minorities.

The two most recently appointed justices were women, and one a woman of color. Ketanji Brown Jackson, previously a federal appeals court judge, in 2022 became the first Black woman on the high court. She succeeded Stephen Breyer, who is White.

And Amy Coney Barrett, also previously a federal appeals court judge, was chosen by Donald Trump to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020.

Here’s how the demographics of the nation’s highest court have stacked up since its beginning.

Four have been people of color

Only three African American justices, Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson have served on the court.

The first appointment – when Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Marshall – was in 1967. When Johnson announced the nomination, he said he thought it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it.

Thomas’s appointment happened decades later, in 1991 under George H.W. Bush.

Jackson became the court’s third Black justice in 2022 after being nominated by Joe Biden.

Sonia Sotomayor is the first and only Hispanic justice in history. (Some say Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was Portuguese, was the first Hispanic member, but he doesn’t qualify under current Census standards.) She was nominated by Barack Obama in 2009.

No justices so far have identified as Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander.

And no women or people of color have served as chief justices of the nation’s highest court.

Six have been women

Of the 116 justices in history, 110 – or 94.8% – have been men. Until 1981, every Supreme Court justice was male. But Ronald Reagan promised he’d put a woman on the court, and during his first year in office he kept that promise by appointing Sandra Day O’Connor.

Before that, presidents had appointed women to lower courts. While Harry Truman, who was president from 1945-1953, thought about nominating a woman to the high court, sitting justices at the time said women “would inhibit their conference deliberations.”

Bill Clinton made the second appointment of a woman to the high court by nominating Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993.

And Barack Obama appointed two women, the aforementioned Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, whom he appointed in 2010.

Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett and Jackson all sit on the current court.

Eight have been Jewish

At its founding, the court was made up almost entirely of Protestant members, and a majority of the 116 justices throughout history have been Protestants.

The court today is more diverse. There are currently six Catholic justices, not including Neil Gorsuch — nominated by Trump in 2017 — who was raised Catholic but has more recently worshiped at an Episcopal church.

The US has never had a Jewish president, but eight Jewish justices have sat on the bench, including Kagan who currently sits on the bench.

There has never been a Muslim or Hindu justice on the Supreme Court.

Ivy League graduates dominate in recent decades

While the educational law background of many Supreme Court justices’ has varied in past centuries, modern history has been less so. Of the 60 justices confirmed between 1902 and 2022, 15 graduated from Harvard, seven from Yale and four from Columbia law schools.

On today’s court, all but one — Barrett, who attended Notre Dame Law School — hail from Yale or Harvard. The four Yale graduates are Brett Kavanaugh, Sotomayor, Thomas and Samuel Alito, and the four Harvard graduates are Gorsuch, Kagan, Jackson and Chief Justice John Roberts.

Since Oliver Wendell Holmes’ appointment in 1902, the Supreme Court has maintained at least one Harvard law graduate, and it has usually had multiple graduates.

Yale Law School did not have a graduate on the court until Potter Stewart’s confirmation in 1958.

Why diversity matters

The Supreme Court has ruled on a diverse set of topics and sees a wide array of cases.

It’s laid out decisions that affect many segments of the nation’s population, like whether schools should be segregated, whether women can get abortions and if public accommodations can refuse services based on religious beliefs.

The court has heard cases that none of its members can directly relate to. Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was decided by nine justices, none of whom have identified as gay. No past or present justices have publicly identified themselves as anything other than straight.

In 2016, Sotomayor said the court could use more diversity.

“A different perspective can permit you to more fully understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand,” she said.

Ahead of Tuesday's Nevada primary, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s campaign outlined their reasoning behind participating in the state’s primary election instead of the party-run GOP caucuses on Thursday.

“We have not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada. We aren't going to pay $55,000 to a Trump entity to participate in a process that is rigged for Trump. Nevada is not and has never been our focus. I’m truly not sure what the Trump team is up to out there, but they seem pretty spun up about it,” Haley’s campaign manager Betsy Ankney said during a press call on Monday.

More on the dueling GOP contests: While there will be a GOP primary Tuesday, Republicans have chosen to award their delegates via the caucuses, and the dueling contests have caused some confusion among Nevada voters.

Some Republican presidential contenders, including Haley, filed to run in the primary. Former President Donald Trump chose not to appear on the primary ballot, opting instead to appear on the GOP caucus ballot, which effectively guarantees his victory.

Haley has been focusing on her home state of South Carolina ahead of the GOP primary contest on February 24.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Unlike campaign events – which I usually cover – inside the Supreme Court, no electronics are allowed. Just pen and paper.

Even the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

From where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.

While Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.

You cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Mitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply...”

Kagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.

Unlike campaign events – which I usually cover – inside the Supreme Court, no electronics are allowed. Just pen and paper.

Even the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

From where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.

While Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.

You cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Mitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply...”

Kagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.

Another moment of laughter surrounded the order of specific questions. Kagan jumped in as Jackson pivoted to another point about the officer/office debate: “Could we — is that OK if we do this and then do that? Will there be an opportunity to do officer stuff or should we–?”

They were talking about Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies extremism. He testified in November in Denver District Court about Trump’s history of embracing of far-right extremists how those militant groups interpreted his incendiary rhetoric on the morning of January 6, immediately proceeding the violent storming of the US Capitol.

Peter Simi testifies during a hearing for a lawsuit to keep former President Donald Trump off the Colorado state ballot in Denver in October 2023. Jack Dempsey/Pool via AP

Simi’s testimony ended up being influential to the Colorado Supreme Court’s eventual decision to bar Trump from the ballot. But Alito pressed lawyer Jason Murray on whether other states might draw different conclusions, if they were to vet Trump’s actions on January 6. He suggested that other states might not even consider Simi as an expert.

The questioning was yet another example of how the justices appear to be skeptical of the effort to bar Trump from the ballot.

Here’s CNN’s coverage from when Simi testified at the trial:

Trump was often “using language with a wink and a nod,” Simi said, but members of these extremist groups consistently interpreted his comments as a “clarion call” toward “anger, resentment and mobilization.” This ramped up in summer 2020 as Trump began claiming he was being cheated in the presidential election, Simi said.

Eric Olson, an attorney for the Colorado challengers, played clips from Trump’s January 6 speech, where he urged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” so they could “save” the country (Though, at times, he also said they should do so peacefully.)

Right-wing extremists understood those words as “a call to violence,” Simi testified.

""Within far-right extremist culture, fighting is meant to be taken literally … especially within the context as it’s laid out, that these threats are imminent, and that you’re going to lose your country. Then, fighting would be understood as requiring violent action.”

The relationship between Trump and far-right extremists is “unprecedented,” Simi said.

“Far-right extremists really were galvanized by his candidacy starting in 2015,” Simi said. “And a relationship really emerged between Donald Trump and far-right extremists, with far-right extremists really seeing him as speaking their language, and really addressing many of their key grievances.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Justice Brett Kavanaugh tossed an important question to Trump’s attorney about a 19th century decision dealing with the same issue the court is wrestling with now.

Known as “Griffin’s case,” the 1869 decision found that the insurrection ban could not be enforced without some action first from Congress. The opinion was written by Chief Justice Salmon Chase. It was not a Supreme Court decision but it’s one of the closest things the Supreme Court has to a precedent.

By asking the question, Kavanaugh – often a key swing vote — seems to be signaling an interest in siding with Trump in a narrow way: By ruling that the insurrection ban at issue cannot be enforced with a law enacted by Congress.

“Don’t you think Griffin’s case” is important in “trying to figure out what the original meaning” of the insurrection ban is, Kavanaugh asked.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Leah Millis/Reuters

South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects.

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

Introduces a new process in which US Citizenship and Immigration Services would decide an asylum claim without it going through the immigration court system. The process doesn’t apply to unaccompanied migrant children.

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.

3, 2023 Latest on the new Congress and House speaker vote  CNN","A look inside the House chamber in February. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP/File)

The 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.

Rep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.

Republicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.

Here are key things to know about Tuesday’s vote:

How the day will unfold: Congress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, Jan. 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.

Members will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.

Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.

Members can vote for anyone they want: There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.

Both parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead. McCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.

If neither wins a majority, a “floor fight” happens: Lawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected. This is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker. In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.

It doesn’t always require 218 votes: One important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.

Former President Donald Trump will not accept a plea deal in the indictment brought by a Manhattan grand jury but does plan to file “substantial legal challenges” to the indictment, his attorney Joe Tacopina said.

“President Trump will not take a plea deal in this case. It's not gonna happen,” Tacopina said in an interview with NBC News on Friday.

“I don't know if it's gonna make it to trial because we have substantial legal challenges that we have to ... front before we get to that point,” Tacopina said when asked if he expects to take the case to trial.

Trump will “absolutely” voluntarily surrender to Manhattan law enforcement, the defense attorney said, adding the former president is “not going to hole up in Mar-a-Lago.”

Logistics are currently being worked, he said.

Meanwhile, Trump attorney Jim Trusty said Friday he expects that the former president's legal team will file motions to dismiss his indictment before a trial could potentially get underway.

“I would think in very short order, you'll see a motion to dismiss — or several motions to dismiss — talking about this kind of impossible theory of stacking a federal crime into a state misdemeanor, statute of limitations issues and very importantly, the intent to defraud. That's an element of these false record keeping charges. That's just not present here,"" Trusty told CNN This Morning.

The lawyer said he did not know ""about the exact timing"" as there isn't a case number yet but he noted that it will ""be soon.""

""I think this will be something you can expect in days or weeks, not weeks or months,"" he added.

Tacopina told Good Morning America that the former president ""will not be put in handcuffs.""

Responding to CNN reporting that Trump has been charged on more than 30 counts related to business fraud, Tacopina said he does not know the nature of the charges against Trump or how many there are, but added, “If it's correct, it means they've taken each transaction, each check, each payment, each entry and made a separate charge.”

Tacopina said he does not know when the charges will be unsealed but suggested it “might likely be Tuesday.”","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Arizona's Maricopa County expects to start releasing Friday evening the first results from its outstanding 290,000 mail-in ballots that voters dropped off on Election Day, a top official told CNN late Thursday.

""We should start to see those tomorrow, I believe – we’ll start seeing those come in,"" said Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County board of supervisors.

Maricopa is Arizona's most populous county and it includes the city of Phoenix.

The mail-in ballots dropped off were a record for the county, Gates said. “It’s a lot of ballots that people are trying to process, but we’re going to get through it. We’re going to do it on a timeline that’s frankly consistent with how long it takes us to get this done every two and every four years.”

Gates pushed back on criticism from Arizona’s Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who has been questioning the integrity of the elections and the length of time to get results.

“There’s nothing out of the ordinary; it makes me wonder if Kari Lake has really been following elections in the past in Maricopa County,” he said.

On Thursday, Maricopa County staff verified nearly all of the 290,000 early ballots dropped off on Election Day. It updated an additional tranche of just over 78,000 ballots on Thursday night.

The estimated ballots remaining, according to the county, include:","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

McHenry signaled the two sides are trading legislative text as they go along instead of just toplines, so they’re not starting from scratch when they go to write the actual bill.

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

The trial has spanned nearly six weeks so far with testimony from a total of 25 witnesses – 24 of which were in person.

Ivanka Trump was the last witness called before the attorney general’s office rested its case. She followed testimony from her father and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric.

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Donald Trump’s worth on financial statements.

The attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

The attorney general is also seeking to ban the Trumps from doing business in New York.

The trial has seen a slew of fireworks, including the judge imposing two fines on Donald Trump totaling $15,000 for violating his gag order forbidding anyone from commenting about his staff. The former president had repeatedly criticized Engoron’s law clerk.

Donald Trump attended court a total of seven days, where he attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, the judge, and the case against him.

He did the same when he took the stand earlier this week with lengthy speeches during his testimony that sparked multiple admonishments from the judge.

Trump’s attorneys are set to begin their defense on Monday and indicated they would finish by mid-December.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The craft, described by US intelligence as a surveillance balloon, presented a comparatively low-tech, modest security threat compared to the multilayered espionage, economic, cyber, military and geopolitical rivalry escalating every day.

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He also offered qualified support for social spending programs to help support newborns and new parents but stopped short of specifically endorsing paid family leave for all Americans or subsidized child care.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

President Joe Biden said a debt ceiling deal is ""very close"" and that he hopes to know by this evening whether there will be an agreement as both sides race against the clock to avoid a first-ever default.

""There's a negotiation going on. I'm hopeful we'll know by tonight whether we're going to be able to have a deal,"" Biden told reporters Friday before he left Washington, DC, to Camp David for the weekend.

""I hope we'll have some clearer evidence tonight, before the clock strikes 12, that we have a deal. But it's very close and I'm optimistic,"" he continued.

Asked by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond about Democrats saying he shouldn’t bow on work requirements, Biden said: “I don’t bow to anybody.”

A senior White House official said earlier Friday that the Biden administration believes it is “on track” to get a deal passed in time to avert a June 5 deadline. The official said the White House thinks parties are ""in the final stages of negotiations.""

What Republicans are saying: Key GOP negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry also struck an optimistic tone Friday night about the state of the debt ceiling talks, saying he agrees with Biden’s assessment that they are close to a deal.

“I concur,” he told reporters. “Everybody wants to look for the white smoke. Yeah, we're not at that stage yet. So, you have to have an agreement on the agreement which is the complicated part ... the final bit of agreement is the hardest, longest wait.""

But the Republican from North Carolina said of Biden’s tone, “That is a hopeful sign to me. And I've rarely used that term in the last 12 days that I've been involved in this. So the hopeful sign that the president is saying those things, tells me his White House team, you know, might be in a better disposition than what we've seen in previous days.”

He declined to say whether he thinks the White House is moving in the GOP’s direction on work requirements, which has been a chief sticking point.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Friday sharply criticized Republican proposals to include work requirements as part of the debt ceiling and budget deal, saying the White House is ""standing against this cruel and senseless tradeoff.""

On timing, McHenry said: “These are the things we have to just work through. And I don't know how long that's gonna take. I don't know if that's hours or days.”

McHenry signaled the two sides are trading legislative text as they go along instead of just toplines, so they’re not starting from scratch when they go to write the actual bill.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images

An apparent backtrack by Donald Trump’s ex-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen threw the New York civil fraud trial into more chaos Wednesday afternoon.

Cohen gave combative testimony in the face of cross-examination to two Trump attorneys on Wednesday, after he had implicated Trump the day prior for directing him to “reverse-engineer” financial statements to increase his net worth.

On Wednesday morning, Trump attorney Alina Habba pressed Cohen about his 2019 congressional testimony when he said, “Not that I recall, no,” in response to a question about whether Trump had directed him or Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to inflate numbers for Trump’s personal statement.

Cohen said to Habba that he was lying in his testimony.

But after lunch, Cliff Robert, another Trump attorney, pressed Cohen further on his congressional testimony, and the former Trump attorney had a different response, saying that the testimony was not false.

“So, Mr. Trump never asked you to inflate the numbers on his financial statement,"" Robert asked.

“Correct,"" Cohen said.

That response prompted Trump’s attorney to ask the first time for a directed verdict to dismiss the trial because Cohen was a key witness in the case.

Engoron denied it, which led to Trump abruptly leaving the courtroom.

The New York attorney general's lawyers asked Cohen in follow up questions to clarify his response. Cohen said that Trump never directly asked to inflate the numbers, but that what he wanted was known, because he spoke like “a mob boss.”

""He tells you what he wants without specifically telling you,"" Cohen said. ""We understood what he wanted.”

At the conclusion of Cohen’s testimony, Robert renewed his request for a verdict to and ""end this case once and for all.""

“Absolutely denied,” Engoron said in response.

The case has evidence, credible or not, “all over the place,” the judge said.

Engoron also said he didn’t consider Cohen to be a “key witness” in the case, in which the New York attorney general accused Trump and his business of fraud in a $250 million suit.

“There’s enough evidence in this case to fill this courtroom,” Engoron said.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Ron DeSantis: Live updates  CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis participates in a CNN Republican Town Hall moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, December 12. Will Lanzoni/CNN

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday showed new urgency in taking on Donald Trump, attacking the former president at every turn at a CNN town hall in Iowa with the state’s caucuses less than five weeks away.

In the town hall at Grand View University in Des Moines, moderated by CNN’s Jake Tapper, DeSantis turned most questions into opportunities to contrast his record as governor with Trump.

Here are takeaways from the CNN town hall:

Focusing on the front-runner: DeSantis came out of the gate with a clear focus on closing his polling gap in the Hawkeye State with Trump.

He took an early shot at Trump, blaming the former president for the country’s inflation woes under current President Joe Biden and for his Republican rival’s actions at the start of the Covid pandemic.

It continued extensively from there, with DeSantis lobbing a total of eight attacks on the former president over the course of the hour. He dinged Trump for failing to finish the wall at the US-Mexico border as he had famously promised in 2016; for not debating him; for criticizing Florida’s new six-week abortion ban; and for not replacing Obamacare with a Republican alternative.

It was a striking string of attacks, though, not because it covered new ground. DeSantis has lobbed similar critiques at Trump on the campaign trail for weeks. But he has rarely, in a prime-time appearance, narrowed his attacks so directly at the former president, and at every turn.

DeSantis says Trump is ""flip-flopping"" on abortion: DeSantis has faced criticism – including within the GOP – for signing into law a measure that bans most abortions after about six weeks, with Trump implying it was “too harsh.”

He argued Tuesday night that Florida’s law includes exceptions for situations such as the one faced by Kate Cox, the Texas woman who sought court approval to have an abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday ruled against her, even though Cox had already left the state to seek an abortion elsewhere.

The six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed in Florida includes limited exceptions for cases of rape, incest, pregnancies that jeopardize the life of the mother and fatal fetal defects.

He then pivoted to an attack on Trump, noting the former president had, while in office, strongly opposed abortion rights. He said Trump is now “flip-flopping on the right to life.”

On a two-state solution and Israel: DeSantis sharply disagreed with Biden, who earlier Tuesday had warned in a closed-door fundraiser that Israel was losing international support for its campaign against Hamas amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Biden said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government “does not want a two-state solution,” referring to the idea of a Palestinian state existing alongside the state of Israel.

DeSantis, though, said Tuesday night that such a solution would be impossible because some groups “want to destroy Israel more than they want their own state.”

“I don’t think you can have a ‘two-state solution’ when the Arabs will view it — the Palestinian Arabs will view it — as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel,” he said. “Why have we not had a solution there? Because they’ve never recognized Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And until they’re willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel.”

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare and Social Security: Though DeSantis criticized Trump for not implementing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, his own plan remains to be determined.

DeSantis said he would roll out his own health care plan “deeper in the election season” – meaning likely after Republicans in the early-nominating states have already picked their nominee.

Similarly, DeSantis criticized Haley’s position on reforming Social Security, but he largely avoided specifics on how he would preserve its longevity – avoiding a topic that dogged him earlier in the campaign season.

The trial has spanned nearly six weeks so far with testimony from a total of 25 witnesses – 24 of which were in person.

Ivanka Trump was the last witness called before the attorney general’s office rested its case. She followed testimony from her father and her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric.

Judge Arthur Engoron had already ruled before the start of the trial that Donald Trump and his co-defendants committed “persistent and repeated” fraud.

The judge is now considering how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages for the profits they’ve allegedly garnered through fraudulent business practices, including inflating Donald Trump’s worth on financial statements.

The attorney general is seeking to prove six additional claims, including falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

The attorney general is also seeking to ban the Trumps from doing business in New York.

The trial has seen a slew of fireworks, including the judge imposing two fines on Donald Trump totaling $15,000 for violating his gag order forbidding anyone from commenting about his staff. The former president had repeatedly criticized Engoron’s law clerk.

Donald Trump attended court a total of seven days, where he attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James, the judge, and the case against him.

He did the same when he took the stand earlier this week with lengthy speeches during his testimony that sparked multiple admonishments from the judge.

Trump’s attorneys are set to begin their defense on Monday and indicated they would finish by mid-December.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Rachel Mummey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley claimed the US has “never been a racist county” during an interview with Fox News Tuesday.

Haley’s remarks were in response to MSNBC Joy Reid’s comments on whether Haley could win the GOP nomination as a woman of color. Haley suggested Reid “lives in a different America than I do,"" pointing to her own rise as the daughter of immigrants to governor and UN ambassador.

“I mean, yes, I'm a brown girl that grew up in a small rural town in South Carolina who became the first female minority governor in history, who became an UN ambassador and who is now running for president. If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is. You can sit there and give me all the reasons why you think I can't do this. I will continue to defy everybody on why we can do this. And we will get it done,” Haley said.

When asked by ""Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade if the GOP is a racist party, Haley made a broader point that the US have “never been a racist country.”

“We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. Are we perfect? No. But our goal is to always make sure we try and be more perfect every day that we can,” Haley said.

“I know, I faced racism when I was growing up. But I can tell you, today is a lot better than it was then. Our goal is to lift up everybody. Not go and divide people on race or gender or party or anything else. We've had enough of that in America,” she added.

A Haley campaign spokesperson looked to clarify those comments later Tuesday, saying “America has always had racism, but America has never been a racist country. The liberal media always fails to get that distinction. It can throw a fit, but that doesn’t change Nikki’s belief that America is special because its people are always striving to do better and live up to our founding ideals of freedom and equality.”

More context: Haley had previously faced criticism for failing to mention slavery when initially asked by a voter about the cause of the Civil War during a town hall last month. Following mounting backlash, Haley said “of course” slavery was the cause of the Civil War, adding she assumed it was a “given.” The former South Carolina governor on Tuesday said her motivation for running for president is to prove gender or race don’t act as a deterrent. CNN has reach out to Haley’s campaign for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The craft, described by US intelligence as a surveillance balloon, presented a comparatively low-tech, modest security threat compared to the multilayered espionage, economic, cyber, military and geopolitical rivalry escalating every day.

But as it wafted through US skies before being shot down Saturday off of the Carolinas, the balloon created a sudden moment when the idea of a threat by China to the US homeland was neither distant, theoretical, unseen, or years in the future. And it underscored how in today’s polarized America, Washington’s first reaction in the face of a threat is to point fingers rather than unify.

It was not the first time that Chinese balloons have crossed into US airspace during this administration or the last one — and military officials told CNN this one was not seen as a particularly grave intelligence or national security threat. But its mocking days-long sashay from Montana to the eastern seaboard sparked a media frenzy and a Washington uproar.

In what was simultaneously a moment of geopolitical high stakes and high farce, the White House struggled to explain why it hadn’t immediately burst the balloon as officials in South Carolina warned people not to take pot shots at the high-flying Chinese intruder with their rifles.

This all left President Joe Biden in a deeply vulnerable position as his Republican critics pounced. The balloon could not simply be ignored — especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was about to head on a trip to Beijing that was quickly canceled as the political storm erupted.

“We should not have let the People’s Republic of China make a mockery of our airspace,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Sunday.

Will Lanzoni/CNN

Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized his former boss President Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.

Pence appeared at the town hall hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, hours after he officially launched his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination from the same state.

Here are four moments Pence separated himself from Trump:

Vladimir Putin and Russia's war in Ukraine: One of Pence’s sharpest criticisms of Trump came when he was asked about the United States’ role in helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. After arguing that the US should accelerate its support for the Ukrainian military, Pence pointed to Trump’s description of Putin in a February 2022 radio interview as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine. “I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win the war in Ukraine,” Pence said.

January 6 insurrection: Pence broke with Trump over the legal fates of those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6 – and have since faced criminal charges and convictions. Trump said he would consider pardoning many of those rioters, who he said were being treated “very unfairly.” Pence, though, said the United States “cannot ever allow what happened on January 6 to happen again in the heart of our democracy.” “I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to answer to the law,” he said.

Social Security: Pence said Social Security and Medicare need to be reformed, saying both programs are tracking toward bankruptcy in the next five or 10 years. “It is also disappointing to me that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is identical to Joe Biden's. I mean, their policy is insolvency,” he said.

Immigration: Pence said he would not bring back his administration's controversial family separation policy to manage migrants at the US-Mexico border — breaking with Trump's comments during the CNN town hall last month. The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said during the town hall.

And here are other key takeaways from the town hall:

Justice Department investigations: Pence urged the Justice Department not to indict his onetime boss, saying such an indictment would fuel division inside the country and “send a terrible message to the wider world.” While Pence said that “no one is above the law,” he said the DOJ could resolve its investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents without resorting to an indictment, just as the department informed Pence’s attorney last week that there would be no charges brought in the case of the classified documents discovered in his home.

Transgender children: Pence repeatedly highlighted his support for “parents’ rights,” especially when it comes to schools. But he said the judgment of those same parents should not apply to situations when a minor is seeking gender transition care. “I strongly support state legislation, including, as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition, chemical or surgical procedures, under the age of 18,” he said – even when parents support their child’s decision to go forward.

Pro-life stance on abortion: Pence made clear he would not deviate from his anti-abortion position, saying, “We will not rest or relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the country"" and that he does not apologize for being pro-life. On the question of a federal ban on the procedure, Pence said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.

Usually incumbent presidents win party primaries in a walk. But due to the Democratic Party's beef with the date of New Hampshire's primary, President Joe Biden isn't even appearing on the ballot in New Hampshire. The Democratic Party is also penalizing New Hampshire by taking away most of its delegates to the national convention.

Even though he's boycotting the ballot, Biden's supporters are still hoping he wins and have organized a campaign to encourage Democratic primary voters to write his name in on the ballot.

You won't usually hear about write-in campaigns because they're usually just about impossible to win. It's the “triple lindy” of American politics.

The most recent, major write-in victory in a nationally important race happened in 2010, when Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, lost her party primary to Joe Miller, who mounted a challenge from the right wing. It was only the second successful Senate write-in campaign.

The late Sen. Strom Thurmond, a seriously controversial figure today, won the first general election write-in campaign back in 1954, riding a wave of frustration after the party anointed a candidate to fill the shoes of the primary winner who had died.

So is a write-in win impossible? No. Is it a frequent occurrence? It is not.

Biden should have an easier time as a write-in candidate than either Murkowski or Thurmond. None of his competition has anywhere close to his name recognition. Plus, the people who show up for a Democratic primary in a year when their party is the incumbent are perhaps more politically attuned than the public at large.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Lucy Luckovich

The all-day hearing on former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’ request to move the Georgia election interference case to federal court in Atlanta has concluded.

US District Judge Steve Jones did not rule from the bench on Monday. He acknowledged that arraignments in the criminal case were scheduled for September 6, and said he would rule as quickly as possible.

Meadows’ attorney said “we are entitled to a prompt determination” of whether his state criminal charges will be moved to federal court.

As the hearing drew to a close, one of the judge’s final questions was whether Meadows had any federal authorities that Trump didn’t have as president. District Attorney Fani Willis’ office said no, but Meadows team said yes, arguing that the chief of staff has a “wide range of authority.”

The breadth of his federal authority is key to determining whether the case will stay in state court.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote to watch in the case, suggested one of the main arguments raised by challengers was “at war” with the history of the insurrection ban at center in the case.

“The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Roberts said. “On the other hand, it augmented federal power.”

Roberts suggested the idea that the amendment would give states power to remove candidates under the provision would be “at war” with the whole thrust and history of the 14th Amendment.

The challengers claimed the 14th Amendment lets states bar insurrectionists from the ballot – which means in simple terms that Congress was providing some very strong powers to the states. But Congress wrote and ratified that amendment during the Reconstruction Era, when they were trying to reign in rogue Southern states after the Civil War and reassert federal powers over civil rights.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Unlike campaign events – which I usually cover – inside the Supreme Court, no electronics are allowed. Just pen and paper.

Even the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.

An area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.

From where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.

While Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.

You cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.

Shifting my chair over an inch didn’t go unnoticed by staff monitoring the press, as I was asked to shift it right back.

Press may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell's time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.

While silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.

Mitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply...”

Kagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.

Another moment of laughter surrounded the order of specific questions. Kagan jumped in as Jackson pivoted to another point about the officer/office debate: “Could we — is that OK if we do this and then do that? Will there be an opportunity to do officer stuff or should we–?”

“Absolutely. Absolutely,” Roberts said, diffusing the confusion, as people laughed.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Leah Millis/Reuters

South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects.

This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging.

To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday.

“You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend.

Some context: With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival.

Four years later, the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images

Former President Donald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell concluded his initial arguments before the Supreme Court justices after nearly an hour.

Here are some of the key things that happened:

Power of states: Several of the justices from both ideological sides pressed the Trump lawyer about stripping states of their ability to exclude candidates from power, including whether an “admitted insurrectionist” could be removed from the ballot.

Mitchell argued that it was the role of Congress to determine whether someone should be disqualified — so even if a person admits to being an insurrectionist, states have no basis to act. ""Even if the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist, Section 3 (of the 14th Amendment) still allows the candidate to run for office, and even win election for office, and then see whether Congress lifts that disability after the election,"" Mitchell said in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts.

The role of Congress: Mitchell argued that Colorado's decision to remove Trump from the ballot was improper because, among other reasons, the state disqualified Trump before Congress explicitly gave it the power to do that.

The debate over the term ""officer"": The justices pressed Mitchell over whether the framers of the 14th Amendment believed the president is an “officer of” the United States, and therefore subject to the “insurrectionist ban” under Section 3. The argument is a central focus of the former president’s legal team, which believes that when the amendment’s framers wrote “officer,” they meant lower federal officials appointed by the president – not the president himself.

That discussion led to this particularly intense exchange:

“For an insurrection, there needs to be an organized, concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence,” Mitchell said.

“A chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection?” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked.

Mitchell responded: “This was a riot. It was not an insurrection.”

What happens next for Trump's legal team: Mitchell will have an opportunity to make brief rebuttal arguments to the justices at the end of the hearing, after lawyers for the Colorado voters and secretary of state finish presenting their case.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

On Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.

“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”

Trump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.

The arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election.

It also included assistance for Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation Wednesday during a procedural vote following opposition from House Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.

If it had passed in Congress, the bill would have dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.

Here's a look at the key changes that were in the bill:

A new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach 4,000 over a one-week span. If that metric is reached, the Homeland Security secretary could decide to largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS is required to use the authority. If encounters reach 8,500 in one day, the department is required to trigger the authority. But the federal government is limited in how long it can use the authority.

Codifies a policy that requires the government to process at least 1,400 asylum applications at ports of entry when the emergency authority is triggered.

Raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum, making it potentially more difficult for asylum seekers to pass.

Expedites the asylum processing timeline from years to six months.

Introduces a new process in which US Citizenship and Immigration Services would decide an asylum claim without it going through the immigration court system. The process doesn’t apply to unaccompanied migrant children.

We spoke to Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor and author of the new book, “Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away With It,” for a refresher on how grand juries and indictments work. Part of our conversation, conducted by phone, is below:

Grand jury vs. trial jury

WOLF: What should we know about the difference between a grand jury and a trial jury?

HONIG: A grand jury decides to indict, meaning to charge a case. A trial jury determines guilt or non-guilt.

A grand jury is bigger, typically 23 members, and the prosecutor only needs the votes of a majority of a grand jury — as opposed to a trial jury, which has to be unanimous.

The standard of proof in a grand jury is lower than a trial jury. In a grand jury, you only have to show probable cause, meaning more likely than not. But of course in a trial setting, you need to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The other thing to know is a grand jury is an almost entirely one-sided process.

Usually the only people allowed in the room at all are the grand jurors, the prosecutors, the witnesses and a court reporter.

In some instances, including New York, there’s a limited right of a potential defendant to present some evidence, but no defense lawyers are allowed in the room.

There’s no cross-examination of the prosecution’s evidence. There’s no presentation of defense evidence.

Close to every time a prosecutor seeks an indictment from a grand jury, he or she will get an indictment from the grand jury.

What is an indictment?

WOLF: How would you define “indictment”?

HONIG: It’s a document setting forth formal charges against the defendant.

3 Trump grand juries

WOLF: We have three grand juries that are top of mind — for election meddling in Georgia, at the federal level for declassified documents and then the Manhattan DA. How much variation is there in grand juries between city, county and federal?

HONIG: There are minor variations, but the basics remain the same.

Here’s an example of one of the minor variations in New York State, but not in the federal system, meaning for DOJ. The defendant does have some limited right to be notified and given a chance to testify or present defense evidence, which we saw play out with Trump and then him asking Robert Costello to testify.

That’s not the case federally. You do not have to give a defendant a chance to testify or present evidence. That’s one slight variation. But the basic fundamentals are the same.","{'href': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'title': 'CNN'}"

The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.

The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

Two candidates criticized Trump’s absence, as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was “missing in action.” Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the former president “Donald Duck” and said he “hides behind his golf clubs” rather than defending his record on stage. The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden.

However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling. And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.

Here are some key takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:

Trump’s safe approach appears to pays off: Trump might be playing it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent approach to the 2024 GOP primary. It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of primary voters for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement. Trump’s rivals took a few shots at the former president. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocked him, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate. But he largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of Trump’s presidency.

A messy two hours: The second GOP primary debate was beset by interruptions, crosstalk and protracted squabbles between the candidates and moderators over speaking time. That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for these candidates as they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump. Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trump – DeSantis and Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during the crucial first hour.

Candidates piled on Vivek Ramaswamy: Some of the candidates onstage didn’t want to have a repeat of the first debate, in which Ramaswamy managed to stand out as a formidable debater and showman. Other candidates still had clashes with him. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Scott went after the tech entrepreneur, saying his business record included ties to the Chinese Communist Party and money going to Hunter Biden. At another point after Ramaswamy had responded to a question about his use of TikTok, Haley jumped in, saying, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber from what you say” and adding, “We can’t trust you.”

Palmetto pummeling: All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley. He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations. What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains.

An uneven performance for DeSantis: Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee. Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. The Florida governor did manage to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.
