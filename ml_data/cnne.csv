Kate Middleton was pictured Monday near Windsor Castle on the outskirts of London – the first time the royal has been seen in months.

The Princess of Wales has remained out of the public eye since December, when she attended church services with her family.

Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that Middleton was hospitalized for a planned abdominal surgery, and would not be able to resume public duties until after Easter.

KATE MIDDLETON'S HEALTH: BUCKINGHAM PALACE GRAPPLES WITH CONSPIRACY THEORIES AMID EXTENDED ABSENCE

Middleton, 42, sat in the passenger seat of a vehicle driven by her mother, Carole. She wore a pair of circular sunglasses over her eyes.

The Palace did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace, which handles the household for the Prince and Princess of Wales, told Fox News Digital: ""Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the Princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates. The guidance in January stands that the Princess would be recuperating at home in Windsor.""

KATE MIDDLETON'S PLANNED SURGERY WAS NOT SHARED WITH ROYAL INSIDERS AHEAD OF HOSPITALIZATION, EXPERTS SAY

The spokesperson reiterated the princess is ""doing well.""

The statement came amid a flurry of conspiracy theories that emerged on sites like X, formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok, with users speculating about the royal's whereabouts and health condition. The hashtag #WhereisKate previously went viral on the social media platforms.

In January, the palace announced, ""Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales was admitted to The London Clinic yesterday for planned abdominal surgery. The surgery was successful and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for ten to fourteen days, before returning home to continue her recovery.""

""The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private,"" Kensington Palace said.

""The Princess of Wales wishes to apologise to all those concerned for the fact that she has to postpone her upcoming engagements. She looks forward to reinstating as many as possible, as soon as possible.""

The London Clinic had another royal patient in January, with King Charles III receiving medical attention for a ""corrective procedure"" for an enlarged prostate. The palace later announced his surgery had been a success.

""His Majesty is doing quite well,"" a royal source told Fox News Digital.

Two weeks later, Charles, who ascended the throne following the death of Queen Elizabeth II , revealed a cancer diagnosis.

""During The King’s recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement. ""Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer.""

KING CHARLES REDUCED ‘TO TEARS’ BY CANCER SUPPORT MESSAGES

A source confirmed to Fox News Digital that Prince Harry and King Charles spoke about his diagnosis before His Majesty went public with his health concerns.

King Charles was ""advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties"" while undergoing a series of ""regular treatments,"" a statement from the palace said. It's unclear what cancer diagnosis His Majesty received.

""Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual,"" a statement said. His Majesty has since resumed many of his public responsibilities, and recently admitted the outpouring of support following his cancer diagnosis has given him strength.

""I've had so many wonderful messages and cards which reduce me to tears most of the time,"" Charles told Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

Country music star Kacey Musgraves almost left 30 Rockefeller Plaza unscathed, following her two-song performance on ""Saturday Night Live.""

However, before the show concluded, Musgraves suffered a slight wardrobe malfunction.

She hilariously pointed out the fashion faux pas on X, not missing the opportunity to roast herself.

""The clip. I forgot to remove the clip,"" she wrote with a displeased emoji in response to a fan that adored the way host Sydney Sweeney looked at Musgraves.

As is customary at the end of the show, the host of ""SNL"" thanks the cast and crew. Sweeney acknowledged everyone, turning to thank Musgraves on her right. In turn, Musgraves pivoted, so the camera had a view of her side profile, and the clip that remained in her hair.

The hair clip Musgraves was rocking is typically used to avoid creasing the hair and is often used during makeup prep.

She was not wearing it during her performance of her newly released single ""Too Good To Be True,"" so she was likely doing some touch-ups backstage when the show concluded.

She also performed ""Deeper Well,"" the title track off her upcoming sixth studio album, which will be released on Mar. 15.

Fans did not seem to notice the clip - and if they did - they were supportive.

""Stars, they're just like us,"" one person wrote. ""With or without the clip, you're incredible,"" another user stated on X. ""It looks like it’s there on purpose don’t worry about it!"" another assured the country star.

A mishap like this is probably par for the course for Musgraves, who has experienced other malfunctions in the past. In 2014, she famously told reporters that she had to ditch her underwear before performing with the late Loretta Lynn on the CMA stage.

""And just so ya’ll know, right before I sang, my panties came off,"" Musgraves told the press, per Us Weekly. ""They were the stick-on kind, I mean, just look at this dress…They were stuck on, and then they weren’t stuck on, so I literally had to rip ’em off and throw them somewhere.""

""In case you see them somewhere around here, they’re mine,"" she joked.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Shannen Doherty is reflecting on the tensions that occurred on the ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" set between herself and her co-stars

On her ""Let’s Be Clear"" podcast, she spoke with Brian Austin Green, who played David Silver on the show, and noted that the male cast members seemed to get along better than the females.

""I recall when tension started happening on the set, and it was always awesome to me that the boys got along so well,"" Doherty said. ""You guys were always very supportive of each other and congratulating each other, and it wasn't necessarily the same with the girls.""

Green clarified, ""Let's just say it wasn't the same with the girls instead of, it wasn't always necessarily the same. 'Cause I feel like you're sugarcoating that situation a little bit.""

'BEVERLY HILLS, 90210' STAR SHANNEN DOHERTY OPENS UP ABOUT BEING FIRED FROM SHOW: 'I DO BLAME MYSELF'

He continued, ""I remember it got really rough and competitive for you all. Like it was, that was not an easy situation to watch. I remember the guys, we used to talk about that.""

""I remember at one point when there was a fight out front, and Ian and I were there,"" Green added. ""And so, we were the two that stepped into, kind of, the middle of it to keep it from escalating.""

Doherty recalled a disagreement with their co-star Jennie Garth over a prank.

""What's really funny about that fight that was between myself and Jennie, and it started – I don't know if you remember why it started – she was doing, she was calling it ‘Pants Down Day,’ where she would pull the pants on some of the crew members in a funny way, but some of them were getting pretty annoyed with it,"" the 52-year-old recalled.

""And then I reversed it and I said, ‘Skirt up day,'"" she continued. ""And she always wore the men's Calvin Klein boxer shorts under her clothes. So I didn't think it was that big of a deal. And so I did ‘Skirt Up Day’ and oh, my God, she lost it on me, and I was just not in the mood to back down.""

Green noted it was ""a huge moment for everyone."" He added he now tries to ""understand what was going on"" because he was so young and ""so f---ing selfish.""

Doherty said later in the podcast, ""I think I give us more allowance now to forgive ourselves and to forgive others for being friggin' kids working on that show and having that amount of publicity and attention and fame.""

She also addressed the amount of press she was doing compared to her co-stars, which ruffled some feathers among the cast.

""It was really hard because I think the expectation that was coming my way was that I should not be doing as much press as I was doing,"" she said.

""And what nobody realized was I didn’t enjoy taking my weekends and going and doing photo shoots and doing publicity,"" the ""Charmed"" star said. ""But I had a network and producers telling me I had to go do it… You say yes, even though you’re exhausted, and you’re sort of fed up answering the same questions from multiple people in interviews. And even though there are moments where its super cool to be on the cover of a magazine… but the rest, all the rest, I was pretty exhausted, and I was going through a lot of my own growing up, and it really seemed like I was getting the brunt of ‘Why is this show about Brenda and Brandon?’""

Green agreed, and Doherty added with a laugh that part of why she got so much attention for the show was ""because it’s about the Walshes,"" referring to her and Jason Priestley’s characters, who move to Beverly Hills in the first episode and kick off the show’s storylines.

Doherty has also recently been embroiled in a feud with her ""Charmed"" co-star Alyssa Milano, claiming Milano had her fired after the show's third season. The actresses have gone back and forth at public events with dueling claims over who caused the drama.

Recently, Doherty appeared with her fellow ""Charmed"" stars Holly Marie Combs and Rose McGowan, stating, ""There is no revisionist history in the truth that I know we told [on the podcast].… What somebody else may call trauma is an actual trauma for me that I have lived with for an extremely long time. And it is only through my battle with cancer that I decided to address this trauma and be open and honest about it, so I could actually heal from a livelihood that was taken away from me; a livelihood that was taken away from my family because someone else wanted to be No. 1 on the call sheet.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

American rock band Blackberry Smoke is mourning the loss of their beloved drummer and co-founder, Brit Turner.

The musician passed away at 57, after an almost two-year battle with brain cancer, more specifically glioblastoma.

""It is with the deepest sorrow that we inform everyone that our brother Brit Turner has moved on from this life. If you had the privilege of knowing Brit on any level, you know he was the most caring, empathetic, driven and endearing person one could ever hope to meet,"" the band wrote in a statement shared with Fox News Digital by their representative.

BLACKBERRY SMOKE STEERS CLEAR OF POLITICS, STICKS TO MUSIC

""Brit was Blackberry Smoke’s True North, the compass that instituted the ideology that will continue to guide this band. Brit has battled glioblastoma since his diagnosis in the fall of 2022 and fought every day. We ask for prayers for his family and band brothers,"" they added. Brit's biological brother, Richard, is the band's bassist and back-up vocalist.

Founded in 2000, the band also included lead vocalist Charlie Starr, Paul Jackson and Brandon Still since it's inception, adding rockers Benji Shanks and Preston Holcomb in 2018.

""More information on arrangements will be forthcoming. Thank you to everyone who has supported and been there for Brit and his family through this fight,"" the statement concluded. The group is currently on their ""Be Right Here"" international tour.

Blackberry Smoke is credited as the first independent artist to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Country Album charts. The group first saw success with their third studio album, ""The Whippoorwill"" which charted on the Billboard Top 40.

Since gaining notoriety, Blackberry Smoke has performed alongside several notable musicians, including Zac Brown Band, Guns N' Roses, Eric Church, ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

The Zac Brown band shared their condolences with the group, writing on their Instagram story, ""Sending love to our brothers."" Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash wrote on his own Instagram, ""We lost a f---ing great guy & musician today, #BritTurner He will be sorely missed. My heart goes out to Brit's family, friends & band mates. RIP.""

No one can roast actress Sydney Sweeney quite like she can.

The host of ""Saturday Night Live"" this week, Sweeney, 26, addressed a litany of rumors she'd heard about herself in the media, and left no stone unturned.

""The craziest rumor I've seen is that while I was filming ‘Anyone But You’ I was having an affair with my co-star Glen Powell. That's obviously not true,"" she told the giggly crowd of her hit romantic-comedy. ""Me and my fiancé produced the movie together, and he was there the entire shoot.""

An ongoing narrative during the filming and the consequential press tour for ""Anyone But You"" was that Sweeney and Powell were secretly seeing each other. Both have denied the claims.

""I just want to let everyone know that he's the man of my dreams and we're still together and stronger than ever. He even came here tonight to support me,"" she exclaimed, asking the ""SNL"" cameras to cut to her beau.

The camera panned to a ""clueless"" Powell, who looked displeased upon the realization he was on television, much to the audience's glee.

""That's not my fiancé, he's in my dressing room,"" Sweeney joked before announcing the show's musical guest, Kacey Musgraves. Sweeney has reportedly been engaged to businessman Jonathan Davino since 2022.

Sweeney also touched upon her recent box office flop, ""Madame Web.""

""You might have seen me in ‘Anyone But You’ or ‘Euphoria,'"" she told the crowd. ""You definitely did not see me in ‘Madame Web,’"" she said of the female-fronted Marvel drama starring Dakota Johnson.

The movie brought in a measly $17.6 million on its opening weekend in February.

Sweeney even took a crack at her looks. Often praised for her enviable figure, she also addressed a popular fad used in Hollywood: weight-loss injections. Refuting a rumor that she had ever used a nutritionist, Sweeney teased, ""I'm in shape because I run, avoid sugar and do Ozempic.""

Ozempic is a federally approved Type-2 diabetes medication, but is commonly used as a weight-loss drug.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Keith Urban is stressing the importance of staying true to yourself while sharing some regrets from his past in the music industry.

Appearing on SiriusXM's ""Highway Mornings"" show to promote his new music, Urban touched upon his earlier hit, ""Somebody Like You,"" and its usage in an iconic 2003 romantic comedy.

""That's a great example of learning early on the price of — I wouldn't say selling out — but pretty darn close to it,"" he said of allowing his song to be featured in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" starring Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.

""Cause we get asked to put that song in the movie, and then there was like, ‘By the way, you sing it kind of country-ish.’ And I'm like, ‘I just sing it the way I sing.’ And they're like, ‘Yeah, we just wonder if you could re-do the vocal.'""

""I was like, ‘Uh, okay. Well, it’s a big film. Okay, let's do that,'"" he remembered thinking.

When he got into the recording studio, Urban says he realized he landed himself in a bit of a predicament. ""There's all these executives from the film, talking in my headphones while I'm at the microphone doing this vocal, almost coaching me of how to sing this song.""

The song plays during an endearing scene in the flick where ladies man Ben (McConaughey) teaches determined writer Andie (Hudson), how to ride a motorcycle.

Please enter a valid email address.

""Jeopardy!"" fans are in an uproar over a clue presented on Monday's episode.

In the category ""Speech! Parts of Speech!,"" one of the contestants selected the $600 clue, which, as host Ken Jennings read, was ""xem, xyrs, xemself."" The same contestant buzzed in to answer ""What are pronouns?,"" and Jennings awarded him the money, saying, ""Those are pronouns, neopronouns.""

The prefix ""neo"" means ""new"" — neopronouns are new pronouns, typically ones that are used to avoid ""he"" or ""she.""

'JEOPARDY!' FANS CALL OUT CONFUSING FINAL JEOPARDY CLUE: ‘NOT THE FIRST WORD I’D USE'

The show moved on quickly, with Jennings and the contestants jumping to the next question, but many viewers were surprised to see a clue about neopronouns on the game show.

""So, in order to win at Jeopardy, you need to be able to keep up with whatever bull the wokes are coming up with?"" one person asked on X.

Another former fan said they are ""done"" with ""Jeopardy!,"" and one said that if they were asked the question, ""I would answer by turning off the television, never watching that effing show again.""

""So much for Jeopardy,"" a complaint read. ""The woke crowd has claimed another. That's OK. I have my King James Bible to read. Like God, that will never change.""

Several viewers brought up Alex Trebek, the longtime host who died in 2020 after battling pancreatic cancer. The suggestion was that Trebek never would have agreed to such a question being presented on the show.

‘JEOPARDY!' FANS BLAST CONTESTANTS MISSING POP CULTURE QUESTIONS: ‘NONE OF THESE NERDS KNEW THE ANSWER’

""They didn’t waste time making Alex start spinning in his grave; did they?"" a fan wrote. Another asserted that ""Jeopardy died with Alex Trebek.""

One more former fan insisted, ""I will NEVER watch Jeopardy after this. After Alex, it all went downhill.""

But other fans applauded the clue. One person wrote, ""Jeopardy just had a question about neo pronouns & it's probably silly of me, but that was so exciting to see. And it wasn't treated like a joke, either.""

Another commented, ""I don’t really get the outrage on this one. It’s a good Jeopardy! question because those are a confusing example of pronouns that would take most people time to realize what part of speech they are.""

Thousands of X users are discussing the moment. Popular account Libs of TikTok shared the clip of the pronoun question, and so far it's been liked 12,000 times and retweeted 3,000 times. The video has over a million views.

Before this controversy, ""Jeopardy!"" fans made another clip from the show go viral for a much more innocuous reason.

During an episode last week, contestants were shown a picture of an American figure skating legend with the clue, ""At the Winter Olympics , this American won gold with a four-and-a-half-minute program that featured multiple triple jumps."" The photo was of Scott Hamilton.

Deb Bilodeau, who had $2,000 at that point, guessed, ""Who is Mary Lou Retton?""

Those watching the classic quiz show at home were delighted with the answer and had some fun at Bilodeau’s expense.

Singer Rihanna found love – and reportedly a big pay day – in India.

The musician, who has built her own billion dollar empire as a musician and business owner, was allegedly paid upwards of $6 million to perform at the pre-wedding festivities for Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's youngest son, Anant, per multiple reports. The richest man in Asia, Ambani is the 9th wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes.

Video shared to social media showed the Barbadian singer performing some of her top hits, including ""Pour It Up,"" and ""B---h Better Have My Money"" to a massive crowd.

FROM FENTY BEAUTY TO SAVAGE X FENTY: HOW RIHANNA HAS TAKEN OVER THE MUSIC AND BUSINESS WORLDS

The guest list for the multi-day bash in Jamnagar, India was nearly 1200 people.

RIhanna's appearance holds significance, as the 36-year-old has shifted away from the music industry for the better part of the last decade.

Her last studio album, ""Anti,"" was released in 2016, and before her Super Bowl LVII halftime show in 2023, Rihanna hadn't performed live on-stage since 2018.

In 2022, she released the song ""Lift Me Up,"" for the soundtrack of the superhero film ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.""

They say no press is bad press. Reality star Kristin Cavallari seems to be buying into that narrative.

Days after taking her relationship with 24-year-old Mark Estes public, the reality star, 37, is doubling down on her decision to do so, taunting haters online.

In a video shared to her TikTok account, Cavallari lip-synced a popular remixed sound found on the app about being arrested. The sound originates from an Inside Edition interview.

""So what are you gonna do about it,"" Cavallari lip-syncs unabashedly in her closet.

""We're reporting it,"" the sound continues.

""Are you gonna arrest me? Are you gonna give me a ticket?"" Cavallari mouths.

""The Hills"" star left nothing up to interpretation, choosing to caption the post, ""When they're all up in arms that [I'm] dating a 24-year-old. Andddd?""

The post has garnered over 4,000 comments, many of which are supportive of Cavallari. Others questioned the authenticity of the relationship and noted that Estes was only 4 when she made her reality television debut on ""Laguna Beach"" in 2004.

Last month, Cavallari stunned the internet when she took her romance with Estes public. ""He makes me happy,"" she captioned an Instagram photo of the two.

Estes uploaded a video to his TikTok the same day, with the caption, ""ready to fall"" where the two shared a kiss.

According to his social media, Estes is a member of the Montana Boyz, a group of three young men from Montana who have garnered their own following. In addition to lip-syncing songs on the social media app, they have their own clothing brand.

A current resident of Nashville, where Cavallari lives with her three children, Estes only completed his time as a collegiate athlete in November 2023.

Adam Harrison, the son of ""Pawn Stars"" personality Rick Harrison, died from an accidental overdose.

Adam's cause of death was due to ""fentanyl and methamphetamine toxicity,"" Clark County Nevada coroners confirmed to Fox News Digital.

His manner of death was ruled an accident. Adam died Jan. 19 at the age of 39.

Rick had previously confirmed to Fox News Digital that fentanyl was to blame for his son's death.

""Yes, I can confirm Adam died from a fentanyl overdose,"" Rick told Fox News Digital in January. ""The fentanyl crisis in this country must be taken more seriously. It seems it is just flowing over the borders and nothing is being done about it. We must do better.""

‘PAWN STARS’ PERSONALITY RICK HARRISON SAYS SON ADAM DIED FROM FENTANYL OVERDOSE, BLAMES BORDER CRISIS

The Drug Enforcement Agency lists fentanyl as a Schedule II controlled substance ""that is similar to morphine but about 100 times more potent,"" and noted two milligrams (less than a grain of salt) of the synthetic opioid can be lethal, depending on a person's body size.

In an incident report obtained by the New York Post , Adam had reportedly been behind bars for months before moving into a guesthouse in the Las Vegas area, where he was found dead Jan. 19.

Adam was living in the guesthouse for two weeks before his death, according to the report. A woman who lived in an RV between the main house and the guesthouse told police he ""demonstrated some alarming behavior, including barricading himself in the house by pushing furniture against the house.""

Adam was last seen Jan. 17, the outlet stated. A woman renting the main house became concerned when he didn't answer the door after she knocked multiple times. She reportedly found a message from Adam on Facebook saying he was sick and would quarantine.

On Jan. 19, the woman contacted the landlord, who went into the guesthouse and found Adam unresponsive in bed.

Police reportedly found ""two vials of a redacted substance next to the mattress,"" in addition to ""foil with an unknown pill, lighters and narcotic paraphernalia straws.""

The Las Vegas Metro Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for more information.

Adam was Rick's second child with his ex-wife Kim. Rick and Kim also have a son, Corey, who is featured on ""Pawn Stars."" Rick remarried and has a son, Jake, with his second wife, Tracy.

While Adam was not featured on ""Pawn Stars,"" he reportedly worked at the shop and in the family business.

""Christians, please when you think of Justin & Hailey, take a moment to offer a little prayer for them to have wisdom, protection and to draw close to the Lord,"" Marx wrote on the clip he shared last week.

In the caption of his post, Marx explained that his wife Eileen and Hailey's mother, Kennya Baldwin, ""often pray"" together for their children.

""I seldom like to post about certain folks in the limelight because of the negative comments that we get,"" he wrote. ""Eileen and Hailey's mother pray often together for J&H and our children as well.

""There are certain challenges that people in high visibility positions face and also the enemy doesn't want them to draw closer to Jesus.

""So often regardless of the material things or the accolades they often face spiritual warfare that intense and seeks to ship-wreck their faith, marriage and life in general. So thank you.""

Baldwin, 57, later shared Marx's post on his Instagram story, which led to widespread speculation about what prompted the plea for prayers for the couple.

Luke Perry was called ""the new James Dean"" – and he was haunted by it.

The actor gained instant heartthrob status as wealthy rebel Dylan McKay on ""Beverly Hills, 90210."" He was styled as a reincarnation of the late actor, who died in a car crash in 1955. The ""Rebel Without a Cause"" star was 24.

Perry, who died in March 2019 at 52 years old, was 25 when the press began comparing him to Dean.

BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN TEXTED LUKE PERRY AFTER HIS DEATH: 'HE'S HIDING SOMEWHERE'

""He didn’t love it,"" Margaret Wappler told Fox News Digital. ""He said, ‘I’m not like him. I’m not him. He checked out early, and I don’t want to check out early. I want to go on to work for the rest of my life and have a long, storied career.'""

Wappler has written a new book, ""A Good Bad Boy: Luke Perry and How a Generation Grew Up."" It explores the life and career of the TV loner, who died in 2019 at age 52. Wappler spoke to dozens of sources who knew Perry both personally and professionally.

She described how the comparison early on in his career ""spooked"" him.

""It was kind of cursing him or something,"" Wappler explained. ""And I think too, he wanted to be his own man. He wanted to be his own person. And the James Dean comparison, there was some resonance to that. And I think it helped launch the show. I think it helped people… culturally understand what the show [was] trying to do. But I think he felt a little strapped in by it.""

Dean was on his way to superstardom when he suffered a fatal crash in his brand-new Porsche Spyder convertible. He was on his way to a race in Salinas, California, 90 miles south of San Francisco. Dean only appeared in three films before his death, but dying young made him a legend.

Even his car, nicknamed ""Little Bastard,"" sparked conspiracy theories. After it was involved in several strange incidents and deadly crashes across the country, the remains of the vehicle vanished, History.com reported. According to the outlet, it has not been seen since.

In a 1992 interview with ""Today,"" Perry addressed the comparison.

""I think that sort of in a way, if they make the association strong enough, I’ll have to pay the price for the fact that he checked out early,"" Perry said at the time. ""And I don’t want to. I hope to still be working when I’m 30 and 40 and 50 and [however] long I want to. I think when I can no longer fulfill that James Dean fantasy for them, they’ll look and get it from someone else, and I’ll be gone.""

""I want to do something with my life,"" Perry shared. ""When my time here is up, I don’t want to look back and see that I didn’t do anything. And by that I mean I didn’t have any effect on anything else. I see a lot of people [who] let their life happen to them… I don’t want my life to happen to me.""

The Ohio native starred in ""Beverly Hills, 90210,"" a series that ran from 1990 to 2000. In a 2006 interview with The Associated Press, Perry recounted how he was partially inspired to pursue acting by another classic Hollywood legend – Paul Newman. He described how his mother kept a photo of Newman in her mirror.

He played out the memory of hearing his mother say, ""He’s the most beautiful man in the world, honey… he’s a movie star.""

""I thought, ‘OK, that’s cool.’ I watched him and, ‘Yeah, man, who didn’t want to be Paul Newman!’""

In ""90210,"" Perry’s character went from loner to part of a close-knit circle that included twins Brenda and Brandon Walsh (Shannen Doherty, Jason Priestley), but also endured a string of romantic, family and other setbacks, including drug addiction. Perry left the series in 1995 to pursue other roles, returning in 1998 for the rest of the show’s run as a guest star.

Wappler said that in his way, Perry embraced being compared to Dean at times.

""He was no fool,"" said Wappler. ""He knew when to lean into it a little bit. There’s an early ‘90210’ episode where they film at the Griffith Observatory [where] the famous knife fight scene [in] ‘Rebel Without a Cause' [was filmed]. And you’re not going to do that unless you know that's tipping your cap to James Dean. So I think he understood when and how to acknowledge it, but not let it define him.""

While Perry ""had fun"" being a teen idol, he did struggle with the role, Wappler noted.

""Who doesn’t love the attention?"" she asked. ""He was an actor. He wanted to be successful. He wanted it. But at the same time, I think he was freaked out by it, especially when there were a number of really out-of-control mall events that happened in ’90, ’91, ’92. The kids were getting stampeded. A girl broke her leg at a mall event. It was scary to him. And I think it was a little off-putting.""

""[When] he gets a little older, the show shifts away from the teenage world and goes into college,"" she explained. ""I think he was sort of in a way relieved to get out of that teen idol mode and become more of this full-fleshed adult, not only in his own life, but in the perception of the show. But… I think [being a teen idol] did box him in. I think it did limit him for a bit as an actor, and I think it took him some time and some moves to ultimately get away from that.""

""I think that’s why taking this role in ‘Oz’ was a big step for him,"" Wappler continued. ""It really said to the world, ‘I’m not that guy. I’m not a teenage idol. I’m not James Dean Light or whatever. I am my own man.’""

Although Perry was best known for his role as McKay, he enjoyed a prolific film and TV career. At the time of his death, he played construction company owner Fred Andrews, father of main character Archie Andrews, for three seasons on ""Riverdale,"" the CW series that gave a dark take on the ""Archie"" comics. A fourth season was slated. Perry had also wrapped his role in Quentin Tarantino’s ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.""

Despite his success in Hollywood, Perry expanded his interests far beyond acting. His family remained a priority. He is survived by two children with ex-wife Minnie Sharp.

Wappler described Perry’s final years as ""a renaissance.""

""He was in the middle of a second act,"" she said. ""’Riverdale’ was a good role for him… [The role] was a dad and a good dad. He really loved that about the character. He saw that [in] himself. He really took being a dad very seriously and loved being a good dad. He was close to his kids.""

""He was gearing up to… go into a much bigger work cycle because his kids were not old enough,"" she shared. ""When he died, his youngest was 18. He told friends, ‘When my kids are ready, when my kids are in college… I’m going to really go back and do a lot of work. I’m going to make a comeback.’ He was in the midst of that. It was happening to him… He was early in his comeback…. Had he lived, I think he would’ve really soared up.""

Perry was surrounded by family and friends when he died following a massive stroke. He was hospitalized after a 911 call summoned medical help to his home in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles.

Wappler said she hopes her book will introduce readers to a new side of Perry.

""He was a talented actor with a lot of range and ambition,"" she said. ""He tried to do so many things. But he was also a good man… I hope that, like Luke, people will value kindness in their lives and practice it, and embody a life you want for yourself.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

New details surrounding Heath Ledger's death have emerged as Hollywood director Stephen Gaghan revealed the phone call he received after the fact.

Ledger's body was discovered by a housekeeper on Jan. 22, 2008. The ""10 Things I Hate About You"" star's death was ruled accidental and attributed to a mixture of prescription drugs – OxyContin, Vicodin, Valium, Xanax, Unisom and Restoril.

At the time of Ledger's death, Gaghan had been working with the 28-year-old on an adaption of Malcolm Gladwell's ""Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking.""

Gaghan recalled the phone call he received from Ledger’s father after he arrived at the scene.

""They were there with the body and our script was in bed with him, and your book was on the bedside table,"" he said on Gladwell's ""Revisionist History"" podcast series ""Development Hell."" ""I think my number was on the script, like written. These guys, as you can imagine, they are in shock and they dialed that number and I don’t know why.""

""I’m in an airport with my wife [Minnie Mortimer] just going from one place to another, and I literally just collapse, never happened to me before or since,"" the director added. ""My feet went out from under me. I just literally sat down because I was like, 'What?' The emotion, what they were going through, I should not have been a party to in any way really, and yet as a human or as somebody who just cares, I just was there and I was listening and my wife was looking at me. I remember her face and I was just like, I was speechless. I just listened and listened and listened. It was just really, really sad. And it’s still sad. For me, I just had to put a pin in it.""

Gladwell's podcast series revisits projects that were never made – including the ""Blink"" adaptation. With Leonardo DiCaprio attached to the project, the film originally landed with a studio in 2005. However, it never got off the ground.

""We pick a studio, we huddle with our agents, we pick a winner, checks are cashed,"" Gladwell said. ""Some brilliant producer is assigned to our case, and off we go. Only it never happens. A year passes, then two years, then three years. And this is why we’re doing ‘Development Hell,’ an entire series devoted to scripts that never happen. This is always the most devastating part of the story, the plot twists that happen off the page.""

Eventually, ""Blink"" landed with Universal Studios and Gaghan spent some more time developing the script. After re-working DiCaprio's character, the director realized he had written the part for Ledger.

""I’d gotten to be very, very close with him instantly,"" Gaghan recalled. ""I just had a real connection with him that was kind of unusual and really special to me. I got really excited and I started seeing him as the main character. Once I started seeing that I couldn’t unsee it, and obviously it was very delicate in a way. Leo’s totally cool. I mean, obviously, he has a thousand choices, but in my mind it was a big deal.""

Gaghan abandoned the revived project after Ledger's death.

Wendy Williams' controversial documentary will premiere on Lifetime this weekend as scheduled despite a lawsuit filed by the former talk show host's temporary guardian against the network's parent company, A&E Television Networks.

On Thursday, the 59-year-old television personality's temporary legal guardian, Sabrina Morrissey, filed a lawsuit under seal in New York County Supreme Court against A&E, according to USA Today. Morrissey is suing Lifetime for injunction relief and a temporary restraining order in an effort to halt the airing of the documentary ""Where is Wendy Williams?,"" according to the outlet.

However, a representative for Lifetime confirmed to Fox News Digital on Friday that the network is moving forward with the release of the two-part documentary on Saturday and Sunday.

""Lifetime appeared in court today, and the documentary ‘Where is Wendy Williams?’ will air this weekend as planned,"" a spokesperson wrote in a statement.

The legal documents state that Morrissey is ""acting in her capacity as Temporary Guardian of W.W.H,"" The initials ""W.W.H"" presumably stand for Williams' legal name after the host began using her former husband Kelvin Hunter's last name following their marriage, according to the outlet.

Entertainment One Reality Productions, the company that produced ""Where is Wendy Williams?"" was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, according to USA Today.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Williams' representative for comment.

""Where is Wendy Williams?"" follows the former host's life after she departed her talk show and stepped back from the spotlight in 2021.

A logline for the documentary on Lifetime's website reads, ""Over the course of nearly two years, cameras chronicled the former television host and radio star Wendy Williams’ on the next phase of her life, following the end of her iconic talk show.""

""The documentary provides a raw, honest and unfiltered reality of Wendy’s life after she was placed under financial guardianship, shedding light on the vulnerabilities that has turned Wendy into the Hot Topic herself.""

""Suffering mental and physical issues, Wendy’s delicate state of mind, erratic behavior and declining health were all captured by the cameras. ‘Where is Wendy Williams?’ is the story of Wendy’s journey to resurrect her career, and what filmmakers discovered along the way. But many questions remain – who truly has Wendy’s best interest at heart? Is she healthy now? And Where is Wendy Williams?""

Lifetime previously collaborated with Williams on two projects about her life that aired on the network in 2021. The host executive produced the biopic ""Wendy Williams: The Movie,"" which was directed by Darren Grant and starred Ciera Payton as Williams.

Williams executive produced and starred in the documentary ""Wendy Williams: What a Mess,"" which was also produced by Entertainment One and Creative Films.

On Thursday, Williams' representatives announced that the ""Ask Wendy"" author had been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia last year.

Swift spent the evening hanging out with her friends – Emma Stone, Keleigh Teller, Selena Gomez and others – while her NFL boyfriend Travis Kelce attended the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Swift and Stone have been friends since their teenage years, first meeting in 2008.

""She was a character unlike anything I'd ever played or read or seen before,"" she continued. ""It was about unlearning things more than tapping into things from my past, which was really beautiful and very freeing.""

Taylor Swift's man, Travis Kelce, is just saying ""yes"" to their romance.

Kelce was celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win (again) with his teammates in Las Vegas on Saturday, but his superstar girlfriend was not far from his mind.

The 34-year-old was seen dancing and singing along to Swift's 2008 hit song ""Love Story"" in a video captured by XS Nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas.

Kelce had a water bottle in his hand which he used as a microphone for the lyrics, ""It's a love story, baby just say yes.""

He continued to dance to the song with his arm raised as the crowd at the club cheered.

The tight end also hung out in the DJ booth with Marshmello to sing his anthem, ""Fight for Your Right"" by the Beastie Boys, and he and his teammates appropriately sang along to Queen's ""We Are The Champions.""

This was the second time in two weeks that Kelce was in Vegas. He and Swift partied together at XS following the Chiefs' big win on Feb. 11.

The 34-year-old singer shared some fun from their night, posting her first video featuring Kelce on her TikTok. ""Accidentally going clubbing with your parents is something everyone should try at least once in their life,"" the ""Cruel Summer"" singer captioned the video.

The video showed her parents, Andrea and Scott Swift, sitting in a booth while the group got bottle service. Swift's dad took a drink and then shook his head, laughing as someone filmed.

Swift also added text to the video that read, ""It's a friends and family party they said. Bring your parents they said.""

Swift has also been giving her man a few shout-outs while on her ""Eras Tour.""

During the concert he attended in Sydney, she acknowledged him while singing her song ""Willow"" – with the lyrics ""I'm begging for you to take my hand, wreck my plans, that's my man.""

In a fan-recorded video , Swift can be seen slightly bending over and extending her hand at ""that's my man,"" seemingly pointing directly to Kelce.

Director James Hawes, who has worked with stars like Gary Oldman in the series ""Slow Horses"" and Anthony Hopkins in the film ""One Life,"" is concerned about the long-term impacts of AI in entertainment.

Hawes testified in the House of Commons as part of its inquiry committee on British film and high-end television, explaining he spoke with the legal team that represented SAG and the WGA last summer about how long it would be before a show could be AI-generated.

""The best guess is that in between three and five years’ time, somebody will be able to say, ‘Create me a scene in an ER room where a doctor comes in. He’s having an affair with a woman, so they’re flirting and somebody’s dying on the table,’ and it will start to create it,"" he said.

""You will build that, and it will be generative AI. It might not be as polished as we have been used to, but that is how close we are getting. I found that hard to believe for all the creatives involved, but I believe the genie is out of the bottle and we have to live with this.""

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

He also expressed concern over the release of OpenAI’s text-to-video model Sora, which included several examples of AI-generated videos.

""The expert I was talking to said to me, ‘I thought this might happen in 18 months to two years, and suddenly it’s here.’ Again, it is text-generative, so somebody just types or speaks into a machine, ‘Give me a scene of a woman in Tokyo walking along a rainy street,’ and it produces it,"" Hawes said.

""It is not library footage assembled; it is digitally produced. It is not live-action perfect, but it is pretty damn close.""

The television director, with credits like ""Penny Dreadful"" and ""Snowpiercer"" to his name, noted human creativity is still vital to the process.

He cited an example of working with Anthony Hopkins on their film ""One Life,"" when the Oscar winner decided to play the piano on set during a break, and it ended up in the finished product.

""AI is not going to predict that. It is not going to invent that. It has not yet got the human soul, the human experience. That is why I think there will be twin tracks for a long time to come, and we will choose,"" Hawes said.

He concluded that AI is ""inevitable,"" but humans will still play a key role in creativity.

""I think we have to embrace it, harness it and learn what it can do for us,"" Hawes said. ""I think there will continue to be humans telling stories, and I think humans must be at the heart of telling these stories. AI will need people to guide it, drive it and help shape those stories. It will be a storytelling tool. We will be able to create the rainy streets of Tokyo in a way that we could not before.""

Hawes also encouraged the committee to support creatives in utilizing the technology.

""We are behind at the moment. We need to be talking to some of those brilliant people in Soho. We need directors to be getting trained and enabled to understand it. We need writers and other creatives to be doing similarly. And that’s something that you guys can help with,"" he said.

However, Hawes also wanted the U.K. industry to secure the kinds of protections the actors and writers guild in the United States achieved last summer during the dual strikes.

""What is currently happening there with the unions, straight off the back of the strikes, is looking at the protections. For instance, the DGA [Directors Guild of America] has an ongoing conversation with the studios, sitting down every few months and seeing where it is now and what needs to be changed in the drafting. A lot of this will come down to the drafting of the agreements — how we protect an actor’s performance,"" Hawes said.

Opening up to The Guardian about his bout with the virus, the “Sully” star said that enduring the symptoms while far away from home -- he was in Australia at the time -- was a bit odd considering Hanks and Wilson, both 63, experienced different symptoms back in March when they each tested positive.

""Our discomfort because of the virus was pretty much done in two weeks and we had very different reactions, and that was odd,"" Hanks said. ""My wife lost her sense of taste and smell, she had severe nausea, she had a much higher fever than I did. I just had crippling body aches, I was very fatigued all the time and I couldn’t concentrate on anything for more than about 12 minutes.""

TOM HANKS-WORN BASEBALL UNIFORM FROM 'A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN' IS UP FOR AUCTION

Hanks added: ""That last bit is kinda like my natural state anyway,” before saying he remained “pretty calm” about the situation.

The Oscar winner said he had concerns about his diagnosis but said their lack of rising body temperatures gave him hope they would come out OK on the other side.

BETTY WHITE, 98, SAYS SHE'S 'BLESSED WITH INCREDIBLY GOOD HEALTH' AMID THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

""When we were in the hospital, I said: ‘I’m 63, I have type 2 diabetes, I had a stent in my heart -- am I a red flag case?’ But as long as our temperatures did not spike, and our lungs did not fill up with something that looked like pneumonia, they were not worried,"" he said. ""I’m not one who wakes up in the morning wondering if I’m going to see the end of the day or not. I’m pretty calm about that.""

The pair appeared even-keeled when they announced their positive diagnoses back in March; in his chat with the outlet, Hanks admonished those who still opt not to wear face masks.

""There’s really only three things everyone needs to do: wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands,"" Hanks said. ""I know societally it’s been politicized, but I don’t get it, man. I don’t understand how anyone can put their foot down and say: 'I don’t have to do my part.'""

Last week while making press rounds for his upcoming film “Greyhound,” which will debut July 10 on Apple+, Hanks once again called on mask detractors to “do your part.”

""Those things are so simple, so easy, if anybody cannot find it in themselves to practice those three very basic things – I just think shame on you,"" he said. ""Don’t be a p----, get on with it, do your part. It’s very basic. If you’re driving a car, you don’t go too fast, you use your turn signal and you avoid hitting pedestrians. My Lord, it’s common sense.""

The “Cast Away” star also said at the time that he and Wilson were the “canaries in the coal mine for the COVID-19 experience,"" as they seemingly became the first famous faces to go public about contracting the virus.

""We had about 10 days of very uncomfortable symptoms. Not life-threatening, we’re happy to say,” Hanks explained. “We were isolated in order to keep an eye on ourselves because if our temperatures had spiked, if our lungs had filled, if any number of things had gone wrong with this, we would have needed expert medical care. We didn’t.""

Hanks added: “I guess we were model recoverers from COVID-19, but we were also isolated so that we would not give it to anybody else that we came in contact with and since then have been doing the same -- isolating, social distancing that is being asked of the world so, we are fine.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Doherty told Kortright that she recently visited celebrity plastic surgeon Dr. Jason Diamond for an ""overall assessment"" and left the appointment with a recommended procedure she was not ready for.

""Sopranos"" star Drea de Matteo is slamming cancel culture and its effects on society.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, the Ultrafree founder called online hatred ""volatile and vile.""

""Stop canceling everybody,"" Drea said. ""You know what I also can't relate to — because I've seen some people send me, like, real, nasty hate stuff on the internet that people have said about me just for fun and — it's not just about me. It's about anybody in the world.

""Why is everybody so angry? Like, why is everyone so mad? Why can't we get back to a place where we really do want to see people do well and feel included and not be destroyed constantly by people sitting behind computers?

""The cancel culture thing couldn't be more volatile and vile and — again, how do you use these words, how do you use this inclusivity? — and it just doesn't make sense at all,"" she continued. ""So, it only works for a moment in time when it's convenient, and it's not going on across the board.""

De Matteo has launched a streetwear brand that helps ""promote free speech."" Matteo told Fox News Digital her brand, Ultrafree, was created after a series of events over the last three years.

""Let's start with a lockdown, and then let's start with mandates — not being able to work,"" she said. ""Heroes becoming zeros. I mean, you name it, every ideology that sort of got pushed forward.

""It seems like that's been hijacked to a degree, like the whole idea of democracy. And I think a lot of the ideologies that sort of got pushed forward were never meant to free anybody.""

De Matteo said the idea for her brand wasn't inspired by politics, but the idea was to unite people despite their political beliefs.

""This is about you and me as people, as human beings,"" she said. ""I feel like politics should take a back seat at this point, and everybody needs to sort of come together and recognize there's a war on the truth and on humanity and on what really unites us.

""There are more things that unite us than divide us.""

One of de Matteo's biggest inspirations to start her streetwear brand was from her son due to his love for streetwear and overall curiosity about what is going on in the world.

""My kids know a lot about what's happening in the world, and they like to examine both sides,"" she said.

De Matteo, who starred as Adriana La Cerva on ""The Sopranos,"" shares daughter Alabama Gypsyrose Jennings and son Waylon Albert ""Blackjack"" Jennings with musician Shooter Jennings.

""I mean, my kids teach me more about what's happening in the world than I would know,"" de Matteo explained. ""I've always lived in kind of a bubble of just literature and fantasy land actors, and they go to school, and they bring all that information.

""So cancel culture, it is real, and I probably learned not to fall into these sort of ideologies based on their criticism of them all. They hate it. They literally hate the woke culture. Even though these kids really are the most inclusive and open-minded.""

De Matteo explained what she hopes her fans will take away from her brand, Ultrafree.

""Let's just get back to being kids again. You know, even as an adult, let's be kids again, man. Let's love each other. Let's not see all these differences and see what we have in common,"" the actress said.

De Matteo has recently become aware she has been ""shadow-banned"" on social media. According to the Oxford Dictionary, it means to ""block (a user) from a social media site or online forum without their knowledge, typically by making their posts and comments no longer visible to other users.""

She believes it's a result of using her social media platforms to promote her brand and using words and hashtags such as ""ultra,"" ""free"" and ""freedom.""

""I can't believe we live in a day like this, but the more you hashtag the words ultra, free or say the word freedom – it's not desirable,"" de Matteo said.

De Matteo launched Ultrafree earlier this month, and her streetwear brand includes clothing items, such as hats, T-shirts and sweatshirts. Her favorite item from the line is a hat that isn't being sold just yet. It says, ""ULTRA F---ING FREE.""

""Even if I'm not wearing a hat that day, I have to bring it with me everywhere I go. And everybody wants them. And we haven't started selling them yet.""

De Matteo noted that everything is made by hand in a printing studio in her home.

""The Outsiders"" has become a beloved film classic, featuring the early work of major actors like Tom Cruise and Rob Lowe.

Now, just over 40 years since the movie was released in 1983, director Francis Ford Coppola has shared new footage of some auditions, providing a unique look at the process and sharing details about working with the young stars.

""42 years ago we cast ‘The Outsiders’ in a unique way,"" Coppola wrote on Instagram, where he posted the video.

‘THE OUTSIDERS’ CELEBRATES 40TH ANNIVERSARY: THE CAST THEN AND NOW

""We had all the actors together on a soundstage and would alternate different actors reading for different roles,"" he continued. ""It was interesting because each of them was watching their competition, so while it could’ve been a volatile situation, it turned into a very positive one.""

He finished, ""There emerged the natural respect and sense of colleagueship among them. The result worked beautifully and reminded me of my days as a camp counselor.""

The video begins with a 17-year-old Matt Dillon in an audition. From there, Ralph Macchio can be seen giving his name. A young Diane Lane spoke about falling in love in another clip.

Cruise and Lowe were filmed reading lines from the film, based on the novel by S.E. Hinton, and Patrick Swayze and Emilio Estevez also make appearances.

Anthony Michael Hall, who went on to be a part of the Brat Pack later in the 1980s, read for the lead role of Ponyboy, which eventually went to C. Thomas Howell.

Howell, along with a few other stars, left comments on Coppola's post. He wrote, ""The people that came to these auditions… so many went on to have great careers. Amazing.""

Macchio wrote, ""These auditions and this film experience still inform me today. Thank you, Francis (and Susie).""

Lowe's comment read, ""Feels like this was just yesterday!"" Last year, he gave a similar statement to Fox News Digital, comparing his experience making the film to the bonds people form as members of a fraternity.

""It was my first time away from home, it was my first movie. I'll never forget it,"" he said. ""It feels like it was four days ago, not 40 years.""

""The Outsiders"" tells the story of two rival gangs in 1965 Oklahoma, the Greasers, made up of poor kids, and the Socs. In addition to Howell's role of Ponyboy, it was led by Macchio as Johnny, Dillon as Dallas, Cruise as Steve Randle, Lowe as Soda and Swayze as Darrel.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The teaser clip for the post-Civil War epic was filmed in Utah and made by Territory Pictures (Costner's production company), in association with Warner Bros.

In addition to starring in the feature film, Costner also directed ""Horizon,"" based on a script he co-wrote with John Baird.

KEVIN COSTNER, CHRISTINE BAUMGARTNER DIVORCE FINALIZED

When asked during a Zoom panel if ""Horizon"" was more difficult to make than ""Dances with Wolves,"" Costner revealed that his 30-year epic took the cake.

""This is by far the biggest struggle,"" Costner said, via Variety. ""I’m shocked at what we were able to get. I shot ‘Dances’ for 106 days, I shot the movie you’re just seeing right now in 52.""

KEVIN COSTNER INVESTS IN UTAH FOR NEXT CAREER MOVE

He added, ""I did learn a lot and I was able to use every trick in the book to try to bring this movie to ground and to bring it to an audience. And there’s four of them!""

""Horizon"" marks the fourth time Costner's sat in the director's chair. His last directorial effort was more than 20 years ago with ""Open Range,"" followed by the 1997 film ""The Postman."" He earned multiple Academy Awards for ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990.

While the premise of ""Horizon"" wasn't explained in the three-minute trailer, Costner highlights the beauty of the American Southwest before zeroing in on the ensemble cast, which includes Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Giovanni Ribisi, Jena Malone and Abbey Lee.

In one scene, Jamie Campbell Bower points toward Costner's weapon and asks, ""You use that much this year?""

Costner responded, ""Haven't had much need of it yet,"" before flashbacks show him wielding his weapon with ease.

""Looks like we got ourselves a bad man right here,"" Bower said as Costner walked away.

Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jeff Fahey, Will Patton, Tatanka Means, Owen Crow Shoe and Ella Hunt and round out the star-studded roster.

Costner's country western saga debuts in theaters on Friday, June 28. The second part of the epic will be released 49 days later, on Friday, Aug. 16.

The ""Field of Dreams"" actor was so impressed with the Utah landscape while filming ""Horizon"" that he decided to put down roots in St. George and build a state-of-the art film studio.

St. George Mayor Michele Randall confirmed with Fox News Digital that Territory Film Studios is hoping to ""break ground in the spring or summer,"" depending on permitting processes.

Once completed, the studios will have 70,000 square feet of sound stages, 51,000 square feet of production warehouses and nearly 32,000 square feet of production offices.

The lot will also include a sit-down restaurant and an on-site catering department.

""He has truly fallen in love with this state, because it's so diverse and so beautiful, and people,"" Greater Zion Tourism sales manager Joyce Kelly said.

Justin Bieber marks his 30th birthday on March 1, 2024. The Canadian pop sensation's journey began as a teenage musical star and evolved into a mature artist.

In 2007, when he was just 12 years old, Bieber began posting cover songs of various artists on the video-sharing platform, YouTube. His vocal and instrumental skills caught the attention of talent manager Scooter Braun. While searching for a different artist, Braun accidentally clicked on one of Bieber's videos and was impressed by his vocal abilities.

John Candy powered through a wild night with Jack Nicholson to film a classic scene in ""Splash,"" according to the film’s producer.

Oscar-winning producer Brian Grazer appeared on ""The Rich Eisen Show"" to talk about his new sports docuseries called ""The Dynasty: New England Patriots,"" where he was asked directly, ""Is it true John Candy was hungover for the racquetball scene?""

""Yes. For real he stayed out with Jack Nicholson until like four or five in the morning, and then he went right to work,"" Grazer said.

""John Candy had a lot of endurance, I mean really, a lot of endurance,"" he added.

‘THE SINNER’ STAR BILL PULLMAN REFLECTS ON HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH JOHN CANDY: ‘HE TOOK ME UNDER HIS WING’

""Splash,"" directed by Grazer’s frequent collaborator Ron Howard, premiered in 1984, starring Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, Eugene Levy and Candy. Hanks’ character, Allen, falls for Madison (Hannah), a woman who is secretly a mermaid, with Candy playing Hanks’ onscreen brother.

Grazer noted that at the time, Candy ""was the most famous of all of them,"" and would only agree to do the role if he could meet Grazer and see ""if there’s chemistry.""

""I went to a Mexican restaurant right across the street from Warner Bros. and he had 17 small rum and cokes,"" he recalled. ""He drank them like one after the next, and he just lit up and was fun, but never got sloppy. Just kept going.""

""The night with Nicholson, I think he overdid it,"" he added. ""So he literally ran into the ball that hit him in the head.""

In the scene Grazer referred to, Candy and Hanks are playing racquetball as they discuss the mysterious woman Hanks’ character recently met (Hannah, who happens to be a mermaid). Candy’s character is drinking beer in the scene and struggling to keep up, ultimately taking a racquetball to the face and hitting the ground.

Eisen asked if the hit to the face was real, and Grazer confirmed it was.

""That was real. We knew we’d have to shoot it in two shots, but we didn’t have to, because the minute he hit that ball, it hit him right in the head, he couldn’t get out of the way of it,"" Grazer said, adding, ""it was lucky it didn’t hit him in the eye!""

Candy went on to film more classic comedies like ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" and ""Uncle Buck,"" before he died in 1994 at the age of 43 from a heart attack in his sleep.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Olivia Wilde, Charlize Theron and Scarlett Johansson have taken note with their own exposed displays, but fashion expert Melissa Rivers exclusively told Fox News Digital the style has already made its mark multiple times.

Johansson stepped onto the Palais de Festivals red carpet wearing a baby pink custom Prada gown with a straight silhouette and a low back.

A peekaboo white bralette peered out above the structured hem of her pastel dress, updating the timeless piece to a modern moment.

The Jake Gyllenhaal-starring ""Road House"" remake is facing two major hurdles ahead of its release.

This week, screenwriter R. Lance Hill, filed a lawsuit against MGM Studios and its parent company, Amazon, alleging copyright infringement and the use of AI to skirt a deadline in violation of the new actors’ and directors’ guild deals.

In documents obtained by Fox News Digital filed in U.S. Central District Court in Los Angeles, Hill and his attorney, Marc Toberoff, allege that Amazon and MGM ignored his right under the Copyright Act to recover copyright of his original ""Road House"" script.

Hill, who also uses the pen name David Lee Henry, wrote the screenplay ""on spec,"" which means of his own initiative, and then transferred his copyright to the studio United Artists in 1986, who produced the finished film in 1989.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Patrick Swayze starred in the original, released in 1989. It was successful upon its original release and gained cult status over the years thanks to cable television.

Under the Copyright Act, Hill was allowed to regain ownership of his screenplay by Nov. 11, 2023, and he says he began the process in late 2021 to get his rights back from United Artists, which was folded into MGM in 2023.

But the suit alleges that Amazon, which owns the rights to ""Road House"" through its acquisition of MGM’s film library, ignored Hill’s copyright claim and ""steamrolled ahead with the production of a remake,"" which was completed after the November deadline.

According to the filing, Amazon ""repeatedly set and emphasized November 10, 2023 as their self-imposed deadline to complete the 2024 Remake — the very day before Hill’s Termination was to take effect on November 11, 2023. This is no coincidence.""

PATRICK SWAYZE'S WIDOW, LISA NIEMI, RECALLS FIRST SIGNS OF HIS PANCREATIC CANCER: 'I’M CONTINUING HIS FIGHT'

""Hill is further informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Defendants went so far as to take extreme measures to try to meet this November 10, 2023 deadline, at considerable additional cost, including by resorting to the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) during the 2023 strike of the Screen Actor’s Guild (""SAG"") to replicate the voices of the 2024 Remake’s actors for purposes of ADR (Automatic Dialogue Replacement), all in knowing violation of the collective bargaining agreements of both SAG and the Director’s Guild of America (DGA) to which Defendants were signatories. These are not the actions of companies that truly believe that Hill’s Termination is ineffective.""

The remake was completed in January, two months after the deadline, according to the suit.

Hill is seeking recovery of his copyright to the screenplay and a preliminary and permanent injunction to stop the release of the remake.

An Amazon MGM Studios spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement, ""The lawsuit filed by R. Lance Hill regarding ‘Road House today’ is completely without merit and numerous allegations are categorically false. The film does not use any AI in place of actors’ voices. We look forward to defending ourselves against these claims.""

JAKE GYLLENHAAL DISCUSSES PATRICK SWAYZE'S 'ROAD HOUSE' REMAKE: 'BIG SHOES TO FILL'

Hill’s attorney, Marc Toberoff, sent a statement on behalf of his client.

""‘Road House’ has become a worldwide cult phenomenon since I wrote it as a spec script in 1986. But recently, when I recovered my copyright, MGM/Amazon tried to hand-waive me away,"" Hill stated.

Toberoff added his own comment: ""The asset base of all major entertainment studios is content, without it they have nothing. It is time they respect the fundamental rights and artistry of creators on whose sweat and toil their empires are based.""

AI expert Marva Bailer said the lawsuit still has a lot of unknowns that will be delineated in court, should it go that far.

""So, this is really a question of timeline versus technology,"" Bailer told Fox News Digital. ""We don't have all the information from both sides of the story.""

She continued, ""It's likely they potentially could have used AI as a rough cut, because if you look at the timeline, potentially the lead actors were actually on strike. So, they might have committed to the film or the project and they themselves were able to do all these rough cuts. And so they might have used AI, but they might not have because that's expensive to use AI. Is that really an area that they would really need to use it, pre-release?""

Bailer also noted that AI is not necessarily the primary issue at hand in the legal case but more the ever-changing approach to how films are currently released.

""I guess [AI is] grabbing the attention, and it's striking a nerve because it's definitely the unknown. But these new models for economy and fan engagement literally are unknown as well,"" she said. ""And so you need to have some type of trust in your fans and the studios. The studios are testing new immersive experiences for activation right at the point of the release and then throughout the life cycle. And that's really what we need to be watching. And people need to be open to this participation.""

CONOR MCGREGOR TO MAKE ACTING DEBUT IN JAKE GYLLENHAAL-LED AMAZON PRIME 'ROAD HOUSE' REMAKE

In his statement, Hill also addressed the recent battle between the ""Road House"" remake’s director, Doug Liman, and Amazon/MGM over the lack of a theatrical release for the film.

""I'm elated that Doug Liman's ‘Road House’ remake is considered to be his and Jake Gyllenhaal's best work to date. Yet MGM/Amazon seems intent on burying ‘Road House’ (2024) in a streaming slot rather than releasing it on the big screen where great movies and movie stars belong. They might as well erect a sign out front advising TALENT BEWARE, NOT WELCOME HERE,"" Hill said, via Toberoff.

In a guest column with Deadline, Liman explained that when ""Road House"" premieres at the South by Southwest (SXSW) film festival on March 8, he ""won’t be attending.""

""The movie is fantastic, maybe my best, and I’m sure it will bring the house down and possibly have the audience dancing in their seats during the end credits. But I will not be there,"" Liman wrote.

He continued, ""My plan had been to silently protest Amazon’s decision to stream a movie so clearly made for the big screen. But Amazon is hurting way more than just me and my film. If I don’t speak up about Amazon, who will?""

Liman said that when he signed on to direct the film, it was with MGM, which was later bought by Amazon.

""Amazon said make a great film and we will see what happens. I made a great film,"" Liman said, adding he was told it was ""a ‘smash hit’ – Amazon’s words, not mine, btw.""

The director contends that despite Amazon saying they were investing in theatrical releases following its purchase of MGM, ""Amazon has no interest in supporting cinemas. Amazon will exclusively stream ‘Road House’ on Amazon’s Prime. Amazon asked me and the film community to trust them and their public statements about supporting cinemas, and then they turned around and are using ‘Road House’ to sell plumbing fixtures.""

'OVER THE RAINBOW' COMPOSER SUES APPLE, GOOGLE AND AMAZON FOR PIRACY

""That hurts the filmmakers and stars of Road House who don’t share in the upside of a hit movie on a streaming platform,"" he continued. ""And they deprive Jake Gyllenhaal — who gives a career-best performance — the opportunity to be recognized come award season. But the impact goes far beyond this one movie. This could be industry shaping for decades to come.""

Variety reported that the situation is more complicated, with a source telling the outlet that Liman was given the choice to make the film for $60 million and have it released theatrically or take $85 million and do streaming only, allegedly choosing the second option.

In an interview with Total Film, Gyllenhaal addressed Liman’s boycott.

""I adore Doug’s tenacity, and I think he is advocating for filmmakers and film in the cinema and theatrical releases. But, I mean, Amazon was always clear that it was streaming,"" he told the outlet.

Gyllenhaal continued, ""I just want as many people to see it as possible. And I think we’re living in a world that’s changing in how we see and watch movies and how they’re made. What’s clear to me, and what I loved so much, was [Liman’s] deep love for this movie and his pride at how much he cares for it, how good he feels it is, and how much people should see it.""

He added, ""I’ve also sat watching a film on my computer, or in different places, and been so profoundly moved. If the job of a story is to move people, I have been moved in both forms. I’m a deep lover of cinema and the theatrical release, but I also do really embrace the streaming world.""

""Road House"" is to be released on Prime Video on March 21.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Gary Sinise's son, McCanna ""Mac"" Sinise, has died from a rare form of cancer. He was 33.

The Gary Sinise Foundation shared the news on Instagram of Sinise's death on Tuesday, with the caption, ""In Honor & Memory of McCanna ‘Mac’ Sinise 1990-2024."" In a statement, the foundation said that on August 8, 2018, Mac was diagnosed with a very rare cancer called chordoma. The foundation said chordoma is cancer that originates in the spine and only affects an average of 300 people in the U.S. per year.

In a lengthy tribute to Mac that Sinise shared on his website, the 68-year-old actor revealed that his son died on Jan. 5, 2024, at 3:25 p.m. and was laid to rest on Jan. 23.

""Like any family experiencing such a loss, we are heartbroken and have been managing as best we can. As parents, it is so difficult losing a child,"" Sinise wrote.

He continued, ""My heart goes out to all who have suffered a similar loss, and to anyone who has lost a loved one. We've all experienced it in some way. Over the years I have met so many families of our fallen heroes. It's heartbreaking, and it's just damn hard.""

GARY SINISE SHARES WHY HE'S ‘BEYOND GRATFUL FOR AMERICA’S VETERANS: HEROES WHO INSPIRE A ‘BRIGHTER FUTURE’

""Our family's cancer fight lasted for 5 ½ years, and it became more and more challenging as time went on,"" Sinise added. ""While our hearts ache at missing him, we are comforted in knowing that Mac is no longer struggling, and inspired and moved by how he managed it.""

""He fought an uphill battle against a cancer that has no cure, but he never quit trying. Mac loved movies, and we always told him he reminded us of the soldier at the end of the extraordinary film ‘1917,’ running through the battlefield, bombs going off all around him, knocking him down one after the other, yet he keeps getting back up, refusing to quit and keeps running forward.""

""I am so blessed, fortunate, and proud to be his dad,"" Sinise shared.

In his post, Sinise explained that the summer of 2018 was a ""particularly challenging time"" for his family. The ""Forrest Gump"" star said his wife, Moira, was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in June of that year. She underwent surgery to remove lymph nodes and began chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

Two months later, Mac was diagnosed with chordoma. Sinise said he was bewildered at the time since he had never heard of the very rare cancer.

""And two cancer patients, mother and son, within two months of each other? A real punch in the gut,"" he wrote. ""I went online to see what I could find. Chordoma is a one in a million cancer. Originating in the spine, Chordoma affects, on average, only 300 people in the U.S. per year. In 70% of the cases the initial tumor can be removed, and it is cured. But in 30% of the cases, perhaps about 90 people per year, the cancer returns.""

Moira went into remission after receiving treatment for months and has since remained cancer-free. In September 2018, Mac underwent surgery to remove the initial tumor, but his cancer returned by May 2019 and was spreading.

""This began a long battle that disabled him more and more as time went on,"" Sinise wrote.

Mac went on to have four additional spinal surgeries and continued to receive chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Sinise wrote that eventually the cancer caused Mac to become paralyzed from the chest down, though he ""still had limited use of his right arm, and fingers on his left hand.""

Sinise recalled that in 2020, Mac stepped down from his position as the assistant manager of education and outreach at the Gary Sinise Foundation to focus on his rehabilitation and recovery as he prepared for his fifth spinal surgery.

A graduate of USC Thorton School of Music, Mac had a passion for drumming, composition and songwriting. However, his disability rendered him unable to continue playing the drums or piano.

Though Sinise wrote that Mac initially assumed ""music was a thing of the past,"" he said his son became inspired in 2023 to finish a track titled ""Arctic Circles"" that he had started working on in college.

""Being right-handed, he would strap a stylus to his right hand, and he could punch letters and notes into his phone or iPad. He also had a small keyboard he laid on his hospital bed table that he used to work on his music,"" Sinise recalled.

Since he could no longer play the piano and the drums, Moira suggested that Mac try playing the harmonica. Mac taught himself to play the instrument and eventually recording himself performing the traditional folk song ""Shenandoah"" backed up by a string arrangement.

After working on the two songs, Sinise wrote that Mac envisioned completing a full album titled ""Resurrection & Revival,"" with a ""theme of bringing something that was old or unfinished back to life.""

In collaboration with his college friend, composer and arranger Oliver Schnee, Mac finished three additional original songs. In November, he held two sessions with Sinise's Lt. Dan Band to record his original tracks and other songs that had special significance to him.

""The week the album went to press, Mac lost his battle with cancer,"" Sinise wrote.

""Our story is not unique,"" Sinise noted. ""No one escapes cancer. It affects us all, as every one of us in this life knows someone, personally or otherwise, who has faced this awful disease. And that summer of 2018, being hit with two different cancers at the same time, was not easy.""

He continued, ""But over the years, through my mission to support our troops and families, I have met the most extraordinary people who have persevered and overcome the most difficult heartbreaking circumstances, and I have learned from them and been inspired by them. Knowing them gave me strength. Perhaps it was God's way of preparing me to meet our own difficult fight, having met and watched so many courageous families confronting what life had thrown at them.""

""In sharing our story, we hope to shine a little bit of light on what has been a difficult time for us as Mac was truly a light for all of us,"" Sinise wrote ""An incredible inspiration to those who knew and loved him, he faced his battle with grace, courage, and love. Even with one setback after another, he never stopped living and learning, creating, and giving, and loving. He loved all our family.""

""There are so many friends he loved and who loved him,"" he added.

The Emmy Award winner went on to express his family's ""gratitude [to] all those who have helped us, loved us, and supported us in this fight.""

He said Mac had leaned on his faith during his long and grueling battle with cancer.

""Mac was a man who loved his Catholic faith, and there is no doubt that his strong faith sustained him through the awful 5 ½ year battle with this crippling Chordoma cancer,"" he said.

Sinise shared his son's favorite quote from St. Augustine: ""You have made us for yourself oh Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.""

""He gave his family and friends so much during his 33 years, and he accomplished great things in those final months,"" Sinise continued. ""With a glorious teaming of two old pals from college, his vision for this beautiful music was realized.""

""Mac's inspiring parting gift to us.""

""Thank you, Mac. You did it. Resurrection & Revival will live on. And so will you. In our hearts forever,"" Sinise concluded.

Mac is survived by his father, mother and two sisters.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

""I know some people have said some nasty things about me having joined OnlyFans. But, you know, the way we see it in this house is mommy's a warrior, not accepting defeat,"" de Matteo told Fox News Digital.

The 51-year-old joined the subscription service, known for its uncensored content, last month. She announced the news on her Instagram with a nude photo and is charging $15 a month for her page.

""I figured, 'OK, so everybody's in their underwear and being sexy on Instagram and I don't do that, but I can do that and get paid for it.' … I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner,"" de Matteo added.

""Things have changed in the last three years. My kids have always been my No. 1 focus. Had I known that I could work out of my closet my whole life, I never would have [believed]. … I know that might sound crazy and might sound somewhat lazy, but I am a very big supporter of stay-at-home moms and women who really love to raise their children. I balanced it all, and I've done it all.

""But I’m 51. I didn't know this was going to have to be a change of life, you know, all of a sudden that during a time I'm supposed to be relaxing a little bit, that I would have to switch careers and figure new things out because my own industry thinks I'm, you know, a savage.""

Matteo was referring to reaction within the industry to her position on COVID-19 vaccine mandates, which she refused to comply with and routinely speaks out against on X, formerly Twitter.

""I guess you could say I was a bad girl because I did not follow the rules a couple of years ago. So, I don't want to be at the mercy of mandates or strike or anything like that ever again,"" de Matteo said.

The actress said her agent dropped her, and she ""almost lost our home over it.""

""People find that hard to believe that I was never really paid very much money for any of the jobs I've done,"" de Matteo said. ""People think I'm f---ing made of gold, and I'm not. I’ve worked job to job. And I've turned down tons of jobs in the past just to be with my children because their dad's on the road, and he's not around as much.""

But once she put up a more explicit photo, she embraced the new opportunity, ignoring the haters along the way.

""I just don't care. I don't. I'd rather save my family than save face,"" she said.

""Listen, for the people who think it's something crazy, it's not what you think it is. And for the people who think it's something crazy, it's exactly what you want it to be.""

The ""Sons of Anarchy"" star says her boyfriend, Robby Staebler of the band All Them Witches, and her children from her relationship with Shooter Jennings are supportive of her work on the site.

""My kids were the ones that were like, ‘Do it.’ She’ll [de Matteo’s daughter] edit the pictures, too, because they want certain things that we haven't been able to do. I used to have a lot of money. And then, all of a sudden, I went from being allowed to work to never being allowed to work again. I was never the kind of actor that took jobs just to stay in the business. I literally took jobs to feed my family.,"" de Matteo said.

""So, when people make nasty comments about why I would have done that, my response is, 'Damn straight, I hope you're never in the f---ing position I'm in. I take care of an entire family and a lot of other people who depend on me.""

She also revealed her kids have read the comments about her decision to join OnlyFans, which worried her at first.

""But my kids are old enough now to read, and everything I do, I do for them. Everything I've given up, I've given up for them. I mean, any sacrifice I made was for them. So, they're going to go ahead and read this stuff and have a different image of me because of what people are saying because God knows how suggestive this society has become.""

De Matteo said she personally avoids reading anything posted about her.

""I don’t read comments. I never have,"" she said. ""I would say that my last few relationships with men I've been with have even deteriorated because they read every comment on my socials, their own socials, whatever, and it destroys people.""

""I know what they’re saying is not true,"" the actress continued. ""Like, it could never get under my f---ing skin because I stood by something I believed in. I know the kind of actor I’ve been my whole life. I know that I'm good at what I do. I do love what I do. But it's not the only interest in my life anymore.""

JESSIE JAMES DECKER HITS BACK AT MOM-SHAMERS AS SHE ROCKS A BLACK BIKINI IN SIZZLING SNAPS

The Queens, New York-born star got her big break on HBO’s ""The Sopranos"" in 1999, starring as Adriana, Christopher Moltisanti’s (Michael Imperioli) girlfriend, the protégé of Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini).

Adriana was at first a typical gangster's girlfriend, engaged in a toxic relationship with Christopher, which included drug use and physical abuse at the hands of Christopher. She eventually became involved in nightclub management, but everything went downhill for her after she was forced into becoming an FBI informant on the Soprano crime family and Christopher.

Her character was killed off in the show's fifth season in one of the most well-received episodes of the series, ""Long Term Parking,"" after it was discovered she worked with the FBI. De Matteo's work on the episode earned her an Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series in 2004. De Matteo's character also appeared in two additional episodes in the following season, in dream-like scenarios.

From there, she appeared in such shows as ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Sons of Anarchy"" and in films including ""New York, I Love You"" and ""Don’t Sleep.""

But de Matteo is shifting her focus as her OnlyFans takes off and she pursues other interests.

One of those interests is in a collaboration with Nocking Point Wines, the Gangster Goddess Sauvignon Blanc, named after de Matteo’s podcast with partner Chris Kushner.

And her OnlyFans work is funding personal projects, like a T-shirt printing enterprise with Staebler.

Comedy legend Richard Lewis died late Tuesday night at age 76, leaving behind a legacy that blended honesty and humor through the decades.

He was best known to most audiences for his role in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" playing a fictionalized version of himself in multiple episodes alongside Larry David.

Lewis had been with the show since the first season in 2000 and confirmed last year he would appear in the show's 12th, and final, season, which premiered in early February.

As of Wednesday, Lewis had only appeared in one episode this season, ""Vertical Drop, Horizontal Tug,"" sharing a scene with David on a golf course, informing him that he was adding David to his will.

""I'm leaving you in my will. I'm tweaking it, and you're in it,"" Lewis tells David, who is uncomfortable and urges him to leave it to charity.

""I don't want to be in,"" David says. ""I have money. I don't need it. Give it to someone who needs it.""

Lewis tells him, ""When I die, I want you to know how much I cared about you. You're my best friend. You're getting it.""

The two argue back and forth about it for a moment, until Lewis says, ""I'm giving it to you anyway pal,"" and David replies, ""F--- you.""

The scene's dark humor with David is just one example of Lewis' style.

Lewis was open about his personal struggles, from addiction to anxiety, over the years.

Here’s a look back at Lewis’ journey from the stand-up stage to television and beyond.

Stand-up career

Richard Lewis was born in New York City in 1947 and raised in New Jersey, the youngest of three children.

""My family — it wasn’t an abusive family — they meant well, but they were in their own world,"" Lewis told the Los Angeles Times in 2014, explaining his decision to pursue comedy.

After high school and college, he tried an open mic night in 1971 in Greenwich Village and was eventually discovered by comedian David Brenner.

Brenner helped Lewis secure his first set on ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" in 1974.

He continued performing and appearing on ""The Tonight Show"" throughout the ‘70s and ’80s, and when David Letterman started his own talk show, the ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" Lewis was a frequent performer.

In a 2010 interview with The Gazette of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Lewis recalled Rodney Dangerfield hiring him for $75 to fill in at his New York club, Dangerfield’s.

""I had a lot of great friends early on who believed in me, and I met pretty iconic people who really helped me, told me to keep working on my material,"" Lewis said. ""And I never looked back.""

Lewis is also credited with the origin of the phrase ""date from hell,"" which became a part of the lexicon and spawned ""[blank] from hell"" spin-offs. According to his website, the Yale Book of Quotations officially attributed the now-common phrase, ""the [blank] from hell,"" to him in 2006.

""That just came out of my brain one day, and I kept repeating it a lot for some reason,"" he told GQ in 2021. ""Same thing with the black clothes. I just felt really comfortable from the early '80s on, and I never wore anything else. I never looked back,"" he added.

The ""Howard Stern"" regular also produced comedy specials for HBO and Showtime, including ""I’m in Pain,"" ""I’m Exhausted, I’m Doomed"" and ""Richard Lewis: The Magical Misery Tour.""

In 1989, Lewis performed at Carnegie Hall to rave reviews, following in the footsteps of one of his idols, Lenny Bruce.

The New York Times even made a comparison between Bruce and Lewis, saying, ""This renowned comedian, often considered to be the heir to Lenny Bruce, is a master of long-form storytelling who turns his endless neurotic energy into brilliant comedy.""

Addiction and mental health struggles

Throughout his career, Lewis was open about his mental health and addiction struggles, earning him the nickname, ""The Prince of Pain.""

Lewis talked about his alcoholism, telling the Los Angeles Times in 2001 that champagne was his drink of choice. He also said that though he ""bottomed out"" on cocaine, he knew alcohol was his primary problem.

In 1994, Lewis went to an emergency room for a cocaine overdose and finally sought treatment.

In his memoir, ""The Other Great Depression,"" Lewis wrote, ""The more successful I got, the more convinced I felt that I could become even more successful if I had a few more drinks before I performed.""

""I needed a higher power in my life to help me in sobriety, which led me to become more and more spiritual. I can't be the captain of my own ship,"" Lewis said in a 2008 interview with the Jewish Journal.

Lewis’ memoir was originally released in 2000, then re-released in 2008 with a new afterward about his progress in recovery. According to the Jewish Journal, in the new afterword, Lewis wrote, ""The cold hard truth is that if I take for granted the progress I have made, I'm a goner.""

The ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" star maintained his sobriety since 1994 and mentioned throughout his routines he regularly saw a therapist. Although he joked about its efficacy, Lewis previously told the Los Angeles Times he’s been in and out of therapy since 1971 after his father died.

""Looking back on it now, as a full-blown, middle-aged, functioning anxiety collector, I can admit without cringing that my parents had their fair share of tremendous qualities, yet, being human much of the day, had more than just a handful of flaws as well,"" he wrote in his memoir.

According to a 2020 Washington Post interview, Lewis has body dysmorphia, though he didn’t elaborate further on if or how he was being treated for it. It was also revealed he stopped going to therapy in 2013.

Acting roles

In 1979, during ""Saturday Night Live’s"" hiatus in early February, the film ""Diary of a Young Comic"" aired.

The 90-minute TV movie starred Lewis, who also co-wrote the film, as a young, Jewish, up-and-coming comedian. ""SNL"" Executive Producer Lorne Michaels was a producer on the film, and it received relatively positive reviews.

From 1989 to 1992, he starred in the ABC sitcom ""Anything but Love"" alongside Jamie Lee Curtis.

Lewis and Curtis played co-workers at a Chicago magazine with a mutual attraction who try to keep things professional. On Lewis’ website, he noted that the series is ""closest to his heart.""

While known primarily for comedy, Lewis also appeared in dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" starring Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, and ""Drunks,"" starring Faye Dunaway and Diane Weist.

And despite his darker content, the comedian has appeared in some family-friendly fare, including ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" and several episodes of the WB series ""7th Heaven.""

‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ and friendship with Larry David

Lewis’ best-known television work is his long-standing role on HBO’s ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" alongside friend Larry David.

The comedians have known each other since age 12, when they met at summer camp at Camp All America.

According to a 2014 interview with Lewis, the two were actually born at the same hospital three days apart.

""I was a cesarean and a preemie,"" Lewis told the outlet. ""I was born June 29, and I stayed in the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital four or five days. He was born three days later. We were in the same ward together.""

Though they attended the same camp, they didn’t form an instant friendship.

On ""The Howard Stern Show"" in 2010, Lewis said, ""Hated him. Never saw him again until I became a comic. Became best friends.""

When asked why he didn’t like David at the time, Lewis said bluntly, ""He was a p----. He was an obnoxious, gangly f---ing a--hole like I was,"" and they used to physically fight each other.

""But when I became a comic, he loved my work and I loved his work,"" he added, explaining they discovered the camp connection late one night when Lewis was admittedly drunk.

That friendship led to David asking Lewis to appear on his HBO series, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" as a fictionalized version of himself in 2000.

Since then, he had been a beloved part of the show and credited it with a late career boost and offering breaks from touring.

""The show's been on since 2000, so when you think of that, say some guy's in medical school, he's 25, he was only 5 when the show started,"" Lewis told GQ in 2021. ""So, there's been a lot of generations.""

In 2021, it initially seemed Lewis would be unable to appear on the series’ 11th season due to health issues. The comedian shared the news on Twitter at the time, saying, ""Tragically, these past 18 months I’ve endured a back and two shoulder surgeries and [will] not able to be in #CurbYourEnthusiasm for season 11.""

Luckily for fans, Lewis was able to return for one episode.

""Great news for me! Although I’m still recovering from three surgeries and missing Season 11 of Curb, LD called me and asked if there was any chance if I felt strong enough to do one episode! I am and here I’m on the set to shoot it. I’m so grateful,"" he wrote on Twitter at the time.

Lewis underwent four surgeries for back and shoulder injuries and pain, as well as a hip replacement.

Personal life and Parkinson’s diagnosis

Contrasted with his confessional style on stage, Lewis remained relatively private about his love life.

He met his wife, Joyce Lapinsky, in 1998, but didn’t marry her until 2005, when he was 57.

""I was really needy,"" he told The Washington Post in 2020, explaining the delay in marriage. ""It was all about the road, and I came first.""

Lewis praised Lapinsky in a 2020 interview with the Chicago Tribune discussing his pain and surgical issues at the time, saying, ""I’m so lucky. I’m so riddled with gratitude that I have a wife who’s doing everything for me, except the rehab.

""When I get down, I think it could be a lot worse, really.""

He also noted at the time he was ""not thinking about stand-up"" and wanted to spend more time at home.

In April 2023, Lewis made the announcement about his Parkinson’s diagnosis and the decision to step away from stand-up entirely.

""I'm finished with stand-up, I'm focusing on writing and acting,"" he said in the video.

""I have Parkinson's disease, but I'm under a doctor's care and everything is cool. And I love my wife, I love my little puppy dog and I love all my friends and my fans. And now you know where it's been at the last three and a half years.""

Lewis said he was in the middle of a comedy tour 3½ years ago, and at a certain point, he thought to himself, ""You know, I’m at the top of my game. After 50 years almost, I'm just going to call it quits.""

He said he ""felt great about it,"" but after he made that decision, ""s--- hit the fan.""

""Two years ago, I started walking a little stiffly. I was shuffling my feet, and I went to a neurologist, and they gave me a brain scan. And I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

""Luckily I got it late in life,"" he said, ""and they say you progress very slowly, if at all, and I'm on the right meds, so I'm cool.""

Prior to his announcement, Lewis also shared a loving tribute to his wife on Twitter.

""I had some great girlfriends so far on 12 seasons of #curb that LD [Larry David] ruined for me, but in real life, my wife, Joyce, has been my dream come true for 25 years,"" he wrote after joking about his fictional girlfriends on the show.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Kool & the Gang's Robert ""Kool"" Bell is celebrating his R&B, funk and soul band's 60th anniversary this year.

During an interview with Fox News Digital, the 73-year-old musician, who is embarking on the 2025 Ultimate Disco Cruise with Kool & the Gang next February, marveled at how the group continues to tour and create new music after six decades.

""It's been a blessing this year as we celebrated 60 years [since] our first record came out,"" Bell said.

""The band started as a jazz band in 1964. And, of course, The Soul Town Band, Kool & the Flames.

KOOL & THE GANG DRUMMER GEORGE BROWN DEAD AT 74

""We are also the most sampled band in hip hop — 50 years of hip hop,"" Bell added. ""So, that kind of makes us the most sampled band in the music industry because most of all the sampling came from hip hop. It's a blessing. So, we're out now celebrating 60 years in the business.""

Kool & the Gang was founded by Bell, his brother Ronald Bell and their New Jersey high school friends Ricky Westfield, George Brown, Spike Mickens, Dennis Thomas and Charles Smith, all of whom comprised the band's original lineup. The group started as a jazz and soul band called the Jazziacs but later went through several name changes, including The Soul Town Band and Kool & the Flames.

""Going backwards — Soul Town Band — there was an organization in Jersey City called the Soul Town Review, and we became a part of the Small Town Review. And we became The Soul Town Band,"" Bell recalled. ""Now, we would have to learn Motown songs because the various artists locally would be singing stuff from Motown and also a little bit of James Brown, and etc, etc.

""So, that's how we moved on after that to Kool & The Flames. And Kool & the Flames, we had another problem. Because you had James Brown and his Famous Flames. So, although we played a lot of James Brown's songs when we were Soul Town, we didn't want to have any problem with The Godfather.

""So, we said, 'Well, hey, what can we call it though? So we came up with another manager as well, Gene Redd, who came up with Kool & the Gang. And we came out with our first record in 1969 as Kool & the Gang.""

After settling on the moniker Kool & The Gang, the band landed a recording deal with Redd's independent label De-Lite Records and released their self-titled debut album in 1970.

Kool & the Gang first found commercial success in 1973 with their fourth album, ""Wild and Peaceful,"" which featured the hit songs ""Jungle Boogie"" and ""Hollywood Swinging.""

However, the band rose to global stardom after James ""J.T."" Taylor joined Kool & the Gang as lead singer in 1979. During Taylor's nine years with Kool & the Gang, the band released their four highest-selling albums, including 1979’s ""Ladies’ Night,"" 1980’s ""Celebrate!,"" 1981’s ""Something Special"" and 1984’s ""Emergency.""

The albums featured a number of hit songs, including ""Ladies' Night,"" ""Celebration,"" ""Get Down on It,"" ""Cherish,"" ""Joanna,"" ""Misled,"" ""Fresh,"" ""Summer Madness"" and ""Too Hot.""

Kool & the Gang has released 25 studio albums to date, with their latest being 2021's ""Perfect Union."" The band has won two Grammy Awards and has sold over 70 million albums worldwide. Kool & the Gang's music has been sampled over 1,950 times, according to WhoSampled.

Artists who have sampled the band's song catalog include Madonna, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Ice Cube, 2Pac, Nas, Q-Tip, A Tribe Called Quest and Miles Davis, among many others.

In 2014, Kool & the Gang hit the road for their 50th anniversary tour, and the band continues to perform nationally and internationally.

Kool & the Gang is currently on tour with concerts scheduled through October in both the U.S. and Europe. In addition, Bell told Fox News Digital the group is looking forward to headlining next year's Ultimate Disco Cruise. The five-day cruise on the Norwegian Pearl will depart Miami, Florida, on Feb. 19 with stops in Cozumel and Costa Maya, Mexico, before returning to Miami Feb. 24.

Bell said Kool & the Gang was previously included in other lineups for the Ultimate Disco Cruise, which takes place annually.

""We've done quite a few. The last one we did was with Royal Caribbean, the Celebrity ship, and now Norwegian has taken over the Disco Cruise, and we have our champagne. We have a champagne called Le Kool champagne, and it's with Norwegian Ships,"" he said. ""We're looking forward to February of next year.""

Bell launched his champagne brand, Le Kool, in 2020 and announced in June it would be available on Norwegian Cruise lines.

During his interview with Fox News Digital, Bell teased what fans can expect from the 2025 Ultimate Disco Cruise.

""Well, if they come to party, that's what we do. If they come to celebrate, that's what we do. If they want to get down on it and especially the ladies, that's what we do,"" he said with a smile. ""And we're going to have Le Kool champagne. That's what they drink.""

Bell also recalled some of his favorite memories from his 60 years with Kool & the Gang. The musician reflected on the thrill of performing with some of the industry's top stars over the decades.

""The latter part of the ‘70s going into the ’80s, we played with Elton John at Wembley Stadium over in London,"" Bell said. ""We did a tour during that time, and we had The Gap Band on the tour. And we had Larry Graham. Well, so there were a lot of different special occasions during that time.

""I'm going to tell you another one that happened after that,"" he continued. ""We did 48 shows with Van Halen. We did ten shows with Kid Rock. We played with Dave Matthews Band. We played with Dire Straits.

""And then we would go around playing with Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder.""

Kool & the Gang was the opening act for Van Halen's 2012 reunion tour with frontman David Lee Roth. Roth invited Kool & the Gang to join the tour after enjoying the band's performance at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival.

In 2013, Kool & the Gang joined the first leg of Kid Rock's Rebel Soul Tour.

""That was great show,"" Bell recalled. ""We did ten shows with Kid Rock, and he wanted to do ten more.""

Bell recalled a conversation he had with Kid Rock in which the rapper revealed he had sampled one of Kool & the Gang's songs earlier in his career.

""He said, ‘When I was coming up at the time, getting into the hip-hop world, I sampled your song ’Love and Understanding.' I said, 'I didn't know that. You did?' He said, ‘Yeah, man.’

""Yeah, and he has a little DJ in his set. And, my son, Prince Hakeem, he's a DJ. And [Kid Rock] would say, ‘Look man, you need to keep rapping on ’Jungle Boogie.' Yeah, ‘Celebration’s' OK, but there is a rap on ‘Jungle Boogie.' And my son has been doing that ever since. My son comes out with me sometimes.""

Though he has collaborated with many musical icons, Bell admitted performing with one legendary artist left him ""starstruck.""

""The shows we did with James Brown. I mean, we had played his music in the clubs back in the '60s. But to be [playing] several shows with James Brown, it was great,"" he said.

""People would say, ‘Well, Kool & the Gang have the No. 1 horn section. And James Brown would say, ’No, they No. 2. I'm No. 1. I bring the funk to the party,'"" Bell said with a laugh. ""But he was good.""

Bell added that thelate funk legend also shared his advice for navigating the business side of the music industry.

""The one thing about James Brown, he would come to us, came to me and say, ‘Kool, listen, are you controlling your publishing? Are you controlling your writing?'"" Bell recalled. ""’You need to be on top of that.' So he was a good educator as well.""

Last November, George Brown, one of the founding members of Kool & the Gang, died at the age of 74 after a battle with cancer. Brown was the band's drummer and also wrote some of Kool & the Gang's biggest hits, including ""Celebration,"" ""Ladies Night,"" ""Too Hot,"" ""Jungle Boogie"" and ""Get Down on It.""

Bell, now the band's last surviving founding member, shared his thoughts on how he wanted Brown to be remembered.

""George Brown was definitely a great writer, and he dealt with some songs that was a part of his life. And one of the big records he had was ‘Too Hot,’""Bell said. ""That was a great song.

""'Ladies Night' was also George Brown. I came up with the title, but George came up with the song along with J.T. and my brother.

""He came up with the bass line,"" Bell continued. ""He said that we had just left a meeting in New York, and he was watching people in New York walk and, you know, as in walk, ‘dong dong dong dong dong’ — walking in New York. That's how he came up with the idea of the bass line. He was a great guy, man, a great writer, producer.""

Looking back on the band's legacy, Bell shared his excitement over how Kool & the Gang's biggest hit songs like ""Celebration"" have stood the test of time and were featured in some of the world's most historic moments.

""It makes me feel great because, you know, you're talking about a song that came out in 1980 and is still popular today,"" he said. ""You're talking about a song that, in the space station, when the astronauts got up in space, they played ‘Celebration.’ So, they like ‘Celebration.’ And so many other accolades for ‘Celebration.’

""When President Biden was nominated for the presidency, they played ‘Celebration.’ When he won, they played ‘Celebration,'"" he said. ""Just a great song. Can we write another ‘Celebration?' No. We tried to. We came up with the song ‘Let’s Have a Good Time.' Didn't quite work.

Johnson responded to the negativity in a new interview with Bustle, saying, ""Unfortunately, I’m not surprised that this has gone down the way it has.""

She said later in the interview, ""But it was definitely an experience for me to make that movie. I had never done anything like it before. I probably will never do anything like it again because I don’t make sense in that world. And I know that now.""

Johnson also noted that the final film wasn’t exactly what she had signed up for.

‘MADAME WEB’ STAR DAKOTA JOHNSON’S ‘UNHINGED’ PRESS TOUR DIDN’T CAUSE MOVIE’S ‘EPIC FLOP’: BRAND EXPERT

""But sometimes in this industry, you sign on to something, and it’s one thing and then as you’re making it, it becomes a completely different thing, and you’re like, ‘Wait, what?’ But it was a real learning experience, and of course it’s not nice to be a part of something that’s ripped to shreds, but I can’t say that I don’t understand.""

In the film, Johnson played the titular character of Cassandra Webb/Madame Web, a clairvoyant paramedic linked to the iconic superhero Spider-Man. ""Madame Web"" earned only $26.2 million over the six-day holiday weekend from its premiere on Valentine's Day to Presidents Day, per Variety.

The debut of ""Madame Web"" debut marked the lowest opening for any film in the Sony Spider-Man universe and one of the worst starts for any movie based on a Marvel Comics character. The movie was met with an onslaught of negative reviews and currently holds an abysmal 13% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes, with an underwhelming 55% audience score.

Johnson also told Bustle that it is ""so hard to get movies made,"" and she is seeing a shift in movies both big and small, where ""decisions are being made by committees, and art does not do well when it’s made by committee.""

""Films are made by a filmmaker and a team of artists around them,"" she continued. ""You cannot make art based on numbers and algorithms. My feeling has been for a long time that audiences are extremely smart, and executives have started to believe that they’re not. Audiences will always be able to sniff out bulls---. Even if films start to be made with AI, humans aren’t going to f---ing want to see those.""

True to her deadpan humor when it comes to handling the press, Johnson joked during the interview that she could predict the headlines that would stem from her conversation with the outlet.

""Like, ‘Dakota Johnson Breaks Her Silence On Madame Web’s F---ing Box Office Failure,’"" she said. ""It’s like, ‘No, I’m not breaking any silence. I’m just talking.’""

During her press tour for ""Madame Web,"" many felt Johnson appeared disinterested and dismissive of the movie, with some social media users calling her interviews ""unhinged.""

""Every unhinged interview that Dakota Johnson gives makes me want to see Madame Web even more,"" one person wrote.

In one example of her apparent lack of enthusiasm for the film, during an MTV interview, host Josh Horowitz noted that there was a scene in the movie in which Johnson's character dies for three minutes.

After Johnson appeared confused, Horowitz asked, ""Do you remember that?""

""She does? I haven't seen the movie,"" Johnson said. ""You could be right.""

DAKOTA JOHNSON SAYS ALFRED HITCHCOCK 'TERRORIZED' GRANDMOTHER TIPPI HEDREN: HE 'RUINED HER CAREER'

Johnson admitted to Bustle, ""all that stuff is ridiculous. It’s hard for me to fake it. It’s hard for me sometimes to go along with the silliness of doing a press tour.""

She added, ""That’s why I have my own company. In a movie like that [referring to ‘Madame Web’], I have no say about anything.""

The ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" star also addressed the headlines about her needing 14 hours of sleep, revealing that it actually caused a fight with someone she knew.

""Truly, but I know I’ve exaggerated in this interview, and you can tell that I’m exaggerating because you see my face. If it’s written down, it’s hard. But it’s fine. I got into a funny little fight with somebody,"" she said. ""I was really annoyed by everyone in the world talking about my sleep schedule, and someone that I know was like, ‘But do you really sleep 14 hours a night? That’s amazing.’ And I was like, ‘Did you read the article or did you just read the f---ing headline? A--hole.’ I bit her head off.""

In the original interview with The Wall Street Journal, Johnson said, ""I’m not functional if I get less than 10. I can easily go 14 hours,"" adding, ""I don’t have a regular [wake-up] time. It depends on what’s happening in my life. If I’m not working, if I have a day off on a Monday, then I will sleep as long as I can. Sleep is my No. 1 priority in life.""

With Bustle, she further clarified, ""I don’t have a nine-to-five job, so I don’t wake up at the same time every day. Some days if I’m shooting, I’m waking up at 3 o'clock in the morning, and I work a 17-hour day, and then when I’m not working, I sleep a lot because I am f---ing exhausted. Or I’m depressed. So just like, everybody, f--- off. [Laughs.]""

That said, Johnson admitted she likes to exaggerate or lie when speaking with the press, saying it's ""the most fun. The most fun.""

She added, ""Sometimes when you’re in a ridiculous situation, you just have to be ridiculous.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

An anonymous Brooklyn federal jury delivered the verdict in the trial of Karl Jordan Jr. and Ronald Washington.

TRIAL BEGINS FOR MURDER OF JAM MASTER JAY, MEMBER OF INFLUENTIAL HIP HOP GROUP RUN-DMC

Jam Master Jay, born Jason Mizell, worked the turntables in Run-DMC as it helped hip-hop break into the pop music mainstream in the 1980s with such hits as ""It’s Tricky"" and a fresh take on Aerosmith’s ""Walk This Way."" Mizell later started a record label, opened a studio in his old Queens neighborhood and helped bring along other talent, including rapper 50 Cent.

Mizell was gunned down in his studio in front of witnesses on Oct. 30, 2002.

Like the slayings of rap icons Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. in the late 1990s, the Mizell case remained open for years. Authorities were deluged with tips, rumors and theories but struggled to get witnesses to open up.

The 29-year-old actor and model and the 41-year-old pop star tied the knot June 9, 2022, after five years of dating. Asghari filed for divorce from Spears in August 2023, citing ""irreconcilable differences."" The former couple's date of separation was listed as July 28, 2023.

During a recent interview with People magazine, Asghari expressed his gratitude for the years they spent together.

""It was a blessing to be able to share life with someone for a long time. And people grow apart and people move on,"" the fitness trainer said.

Asghari dismissed rumors of animosity between him and the ""Toxic"" singer and asserted he would ""never"" speak ""badly"" of his former spouse.

""I've always hated people leaving a certain relationship — and at some point they told each other they love each other, and they sat at the same table and ate food [together] — so I never understood when people part ways [and] they talk badly about each other,"" Asghari told the outlet.

""That's something I'm never going to do because I had nothing but an amazing experience and a great life, and that's always going to be part of my life, a chapter of my life.""

In his divorce filing, Asghari asked for spousal support and attorney's fees. After certain rumors began swirling, his rep told Fox News Digital, ""There are many claims that Sam is challenging the prenup and threatening to exploit his ex-wife with videos. However, all these claims are false, as no negative intention has ever been directed towards her and never will be. Sam has always and will always support her.""

Asghari was the first to publicly talk about the divorce, writing in a post on his Instagram story in August 2023, ""After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together.

""We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other. And I wish her the best always.""

Without going into detail, the ""Special Ops: Lioness"" actor wrote, ""S--- happens. Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.""

A couple days later, Spears broke her silence on the split in a video she shared on Instagram. She posted a clip of herself dancing in skimpy clothing along with a caption in which she shared her thoughts on her separation from Asghari.

""As everyone knows, Hesam and I are no longer together … 6 years is a long time to be with someone so, I’m a little shocked but … I’m not here to explain why because its honestly nobody’s business !!!,"" she wrote.

""But, I couldn’t take the pain anymore honestly !!! In some sort of telepathic way I have been receiving so many messages that melt my heart from friends and I thank you !!! I’ve been playing it strong for way too long and my Instagram may seem perfect but it’s far from reality and I think we all know that !!!

""I would love to show my emotions and tears on how I really feel but some reason I’ve always had to hide my weaknesses !!! If I wasn’t my dad’s strong soldier, I would be sent away to places to get fixed by doctors !!! But that’s when I needed family the most !!!

""You’re supposed to be loved unconditionally … not under conditions !!!! So I will be as strong as I can and do my best !!! And I’m actually doing pretty damn good !!! Anyways have a good day and don’t forget to smile !!!""

Asghari's latest remarks on his marriage to Spears come as he prepares to celebrate his 30th birthday March 3. During his interview with People, he shared his thoughts on aging.

""I used to think people that were 30 years old were so old when I was in high school,"" he said. ""But every person I talk to, the older they get, the more they get to enjoy life because with age comes wisdom and experiences.

""And I think experiences in life are beautiful, so that's something that I'm just super excited to just be fulfilled with.""

Asghari told the outlet he is focused on maintaining a ""healthy lifestyle."" In December, he revealed he had lost ""35–40 pounds"" following his split from Spears, according to a report from Page Six.

""I always have the most positive mindset about life. My experiences in life have shaped me into the man I am today. I will continue growing. I come from a place where we celebrate our past,"" Asghari told People.

""I look back fondly. My past was a blessing and beautiful.""

For Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, there wasn’t enough money in Hollywood to satisfy their lust for life — and each other.

The couple, two of the biggest stars in their day, traveled the world, and no expense was too much for their lavish lifestyle.

""We will never have stars like them again,"" Roger Lewis told Fox News Digital. ""Their romance was so vulgar in so many ways, which makes it fascinating. It was a surreal fantasy.""

ELIZABETH TAYLOR’S ‘ROMANTIC FRIENDSHIP’ WITH COLIN FARRELL ‘REMINDED HER OF HER GREAT LOVE,’ AUTHOR CLAIMS

The author has written a new book, ""Erotic Vagrancy,"" which explores the heated love affair that resulted in two marriages — and two divorces.

""They never settled down into domestic day-to-day harmony,"" Lewis explained. ""It was one big fight after another all the time. I think it’s because they drank a lot in those days. We’re talking about the ‘60s and ‘70s. There were loads of vodka on the movie sets.

""And that surprised me — how undisciplined they could be. This was all facilitated by this huge entourage of lawyers, accountants, secretaries, makeup artists, wardrobe people, people to look after their children and people to look after their pets.

""It was just an insane royal court that traveled around the world with mink coats and private airplanes,"" Lewis shared. ""This was all captured by paparazzi. It was a level of fame that I don’t think exists today. I view Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor as French aristocrats who caused the French Revolution. They were that extreme.""

Taylor and Burton famously began a tumultuous affair in Rome on the set of 1963’s ""Cleopatra."" Taylor was married to husband No. 4, singer Eddie Fisher, who divorced her pal, Debbie Reynolds, following the death of spouse No. 3, Mike Todd. Burton was married to Welsh actress Sybil Williams, but his reputation as a womanizer was well-known.

The romance between Taylor and Burton created a worldwide scandal. A member of Congress even introduced a motion to ban them from the U.S., and the Vatican condemned the pair for ""erotic vagrancy.""

""They would sneak off for dirty weekends,"" Lewis explained. ""They were in their reality of lust.

""And whenever Burton thought, ‘I’ve got to get back to Sybil, this is getting ridiculous,’ Taylor would have an overdose,"" Lewis alleged. ""Meanwhile, Eddie Fisher was trying to control her, and she hated that. She didn’t want anyone telling her what she could or couldn’t do. … It was just chaos.""

Taylor and Burton left their spouses and said ""I do"" to each other in 1964.

No expense was too great for the pair to prove their devotion. Taylor gave Burton a Van Gogh, while he showered her with jewels. He gifted her the Krupp diamond, as well as a 25-carat, heart-shaped pendant of diamonds, rubies and emeralds originally made for the bride of the man who built the Taj Mahal, the Los Angeles Times reported.

According to the outlet, Burton also outbid shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis for a $1.1 million, 69-carat Cartier diamond ring.

""They had a whole network of bodyguards around them and limousines to transfer them everywhere,"" said Lewis. ""Hotels would have the lobby cleared for them just so they could go to their private suite. And they wouldn’t just have a suite in a hotel.

""They would take over the entire floor of a hotel and have armed guards around them. As a consequence of their fame, real life vanished. Everything suddenly became a fantasy existence of money, private yachts, diamonds and spending sprees.""

Lewis said the couple would travel with up to 156 suitcases because ""Taylor never wore the same outfit twice."" They also had a team at the ready to unpack their luggage. During a visit to the Hotel Lancaster in Paris, they booked 21 rooms for themselves.

Their pet dogs would also travel with them to restaurants and be fed from the menu. One of their luxury yachts, the Kalizma, featured ""an armory containing submachine guns."" Its furniture and rugs were replaced every six months. Their dogs even allegedly had their own boat.

On set, no one was to greet the Burtons unless they made the first move, Lewis claimed. The instructions were printed and given to everyone. Taylor’s dressing room had to be filled with ""bushels of white roses and lily of the valley."" They wouldn’t work before 10 a.m. or after 6 p.m.

""Richard’s old pals couldn’t reach him anymore because the phones were now monitored by assistants,"" Lewis claimed. ""Their mail was vetted by secretaries, and it was all just thrown away because there was so much of it. They didn’t even bother to open it. So many of his old mates were unable to reach him. And I think this made him very lonely. But these two people were cut off from the real world.""

But one thing the couple surrounded themselves with were dogs, said Lewis, comparing it to Queen Elizabeth II’s love of corgis.

""Elizabeth Taylor loved animals because it gave her unconditional love,"" said Lewis. ""They had all sorts of pets that would go with them to hotels and yachts. They even got this enormous yacht just for the dogs, which was like a floating kennel. None of them were house-trained. Elizabeth would simply say, ‘Just replace the carpets.’ If there was an awful mess, she would have the entire room redecorated with new carpet and things.""

The couple loved and fought hard. Lewis said Taylor gave Burton ""the terrors,"" which he documented in his diaries.

""Their fights were physical,"" Lewis said. ""They would bash each other. … I think they got bored and would poke at each other. There was also this competitiveness. But all the fighting would end up in the bedroom, which would get them energized all over again. This went on for years, all in front of their servants and paid retainers. It was a very extreme relationship.""

""And Elizabeth stood her ground,"" Lewis continued. ""She never backed down. And I admire her for that. It’s very easy to be critical of these spoiled beasts, these movie stars. But there is something amazingly admirable about their energy and the way they deploy it.""

The relationship was doomed. Taylor’s addiction to pills and Burton’s alcoholism contributed to their divorce in 1974 after 10 years of marriage. Taylor soon called Burton and asked him, ""Do you think we just made a terrible mistake?"" They remarried the following year and called it quits for good less than 12 months later.

Lewis said the pair remained the loves of each other’s lives. Taylor once said, ""I was still madly in love with him until the day he died.""

Burton died suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1984. He was 58.

""Elizabeth Taylor didn’t go to the funeral because she thought it would attract too much publicity and would be inappropriate,"" said Lewis. ""But a few days later, at dawn, she went to the graveyard on her own to pray at his grave. She said, ‘That was the only time that Richard and I were ever alone.’ … It was only when he was in the grave, and she was with him at the graveyard, that they had privacy at long last.""

Taylor kept Burton’s last letter, which was written to her three days before his death, in her bedside drawer. It stayed there until she died in 2011 at age 79.

""I truly believe there was absolute devotion there,"" said Lewis. ""It was much more than a big love affair. Beyond question, they were the loves of each other’s lives. Even when you look at photos of them today … they devoured each other with their gazes. It was a pulverizing love that … became dangerous. But there’s no doubt that the love was there. It never left.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Luke Bryan was on a health journey during last night’s episode of ""American Idol"" with the help of his co-judge Katy Perry.

During the auditions episode on Sunday night, Bryan walked into the room and saw an IV bag filled with bright yellow liquid next to his chair behind the judges’ table.

""Oh gosh, here we go,"" he said as he saw the IV bag, asking, ""Is that urine in there?""

""It’s vitamins!"" Perry told him. ""I knew this season I was going to get vitamins into you, even if I had to stab you in the veins with them.""

'AMERICAN IDOL' JUDGES KATY PERRY, LIONEL RICHIE AND LUKE BRYAN SHARE EACH OTHER'S ANNOYING HABITS

The battle to get Bryan to take some health supplements during the long days and weeks of ""American Idol"" has apparently been an ongoing one.

A flashback montage showed Bryan being less than interested in taking vitamin pills, while Perry tried her best.

""These are called vitamins and after seven frickin' seasons, you ain’t taken one of ‘em!"" she said in one clip.

In another, Bryan said, ""I need Katy’s vitamins,"" and she shouted back, ""I told you! You’d be so much better with a little Cs and Ds and Es!""

Back in the audition room, Perry filmed Bryan getting hooked up to the IV.

""Katy is making me take my first ever IV with vitamins,"" he said into her phone.

She then asked, ""Why do we have to go this route, Luke?"" and answered for him, ""Because you won’t orally take vitamins, so we have to stick you with them,"" and he agreed.

Perry even teasingly offered to hold his hand as the needle went in and Bryan pretended to dramatically scream, but was totally fine.

While the vitamins went in, he realized he could taste and smell the vitamins as they began working their way through his system, and even felt a chill on his arm where the needle was.

As contestant Aniston Pate entered the room, Bryan explained, ""This is my first ever IV, and I’m going through all of the knowledge of that.""

Bryan was pleased with Pate’s audition of an original country song she wrote with a friend, but didn’t clap because he was worried about disturbing the IV.

Pate ultimately made it through, and Bryan noted they had met in the hallway outside the audition room, joking, ""I knew you before I became an IV addict.""

After the audition, the IV finished and the judges joked that Bryan must have needed those vitamins because he drained the IV bag. The medic came and took the needle out, and he genuinely winced as they took the tape off holing the needle in place.

Bryan did struggle with illness last year, having to cancel several concerts over the summer during his tour.

In August, he joked about the experience to an audience in Ohio, joking that he'd ""lost a tremendous amount of money"" by missing those tour dates.

Lynda Carter continues to prove she's a real-life ""Wonder Woman.""

Carter, 72, admitted her approach to obtaining the fountain of youth is as simple as staying away from plastic surgery.

""People still recognize me all the time as Wonder Woman,"" she told People magazine. ""I don't know that I've changed too dramatically.""

Carter doubled-down on her anti-plastic surgery stance and noted she hasn't had any facelifts.

""I don't cut my face, so I probably look just myself, but older,"" she said. ""And the reason I've never had any facial surgery is just because I'm afraid. It's scary, because we've all seen some bad ones.""

Her secret to appearing camera ready is simple enough, at least for Carter.

""That outcome is spending time in a chair with some really good people doing your hair and makeup,"" she said. ""Then having somebody dress you, that has got something to do with it.

""Actors and celebrities always look so great when they're on the red carpet, but when you see them in real life, they just look like a regular person with no makeup and their crummy clothes on. Everybody looks the same when they're not all dressed up.""

Carter added, ""If everyone did a three-hour makeover before they left the house, then they'd all look amazing. What I'm trying to say is, there's a lot of effort behind those pictures. Don't think they walk out the door looking like that!""

The former Miss World USA 1972 told Closer Weekly she's had ""a little Botox,"" and credits Peloton rides for helping her stay in shape. But when it comes to plastic surgery talk?

""I’m just too afraid of looking different,"" she said. ""I don’t think I’m ever going to go under the knife — I am what I am!""

Carter originally starred in ""Wonder Woman"" from 1975-79. She previously told Closer Weekly her time on the show helped her feel confident, even when cameras stopped rolling.

""‘Wonder Woman’ taught women to be who you are,"" said Carter. ""I have received the greatest letters from people telling me what an inspiration she was to them because she represents an inner strength every woman has.""

Carter's fully embracing life as a singer now, and recently released the single ""Letters From Earth,"" a tribute to her late husband Robert Altman who died from leukemia in 2021.

""The soul of the song is about how you miss a person so much, because they're such a presence in your life that it's almost impossible to imagine that you won't physically see them again in this life,"" she told People.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The first sighting of Princess Kate Middleton in months left more questions than answers for royal experts.

On Monday, the Princess of Wales was spotted in the passenger seat of a vehicle driven by her mother, Carole, outside of Windsor Castle. Middleton's sighting marked the first time Kate has been seen in public in 70 days. Her last public appearance was at a church service with her family on Christmas.

Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that Middleton was hospitalized for a planned abdominal surgery and would not be able to resume public duties until after Easter.

Christopher Andersen, author of ""The King,"" exclusively told Fox News Digital that Monday's glimpse of Kate was ""definitely not a staged appearance designed to appease the public.""

KATE MIDDLETON SPOTTED FOR FIRST TIME SINCE JANUARY HOSPITALIZATION

""She was trying to sneak out of Windsor with her mother and was clearly not pleased that they had been spotted by a photographer,"" Andersen said. ""This cloak-and-dagger stuff is only going to fuel more speculation about what's really going on with Kate and with her father-in-law, King Charles.""

He added, ""In its typically smug fashion, the palace issued a statement last week insisting that everything was going according to plan. They never explained, however, why Kate spent weeks in the hospital after ‘planned abdominal surgery’ and has needed to remain closeted away for months. It's all been terribly fishy from the get-go.""

KATE MIDDLETON'S HEALTH: BUCKINGHAM PALACE GRAPPLES WITH CONSPIRACY THEORIES AMID EXTENDED ABSENCE

On Thursday, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace, which handles the household for the Prince and Princess of Wales, told Fox News Digital, ""Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the Princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates. The guidance in January stands that the Princess would be recuperating at home in Windsor.""

The spokesperson reiterated the princess is ""doing well.""

Andersen wondered why Kate wouldn't ""step outside and smile for photographers – if only to reassure the public"" that she was, in fact, doing well.

""This cloak-and-dagger stuff is only going to fuel more speculation about what's really going on with Kate and with her father-in-law, King Charles."" — Christopher Andersen

""Keep in mind that members of the royal family in particular are famous for getting out there [and] keeping up appearances no matter what,"" Andersen said. ""Queen Elizabeth never spent months recovering from an illness, and over the course of her 70-year reign, she dealt with a number of serious medical issues. So, the mystery surrounding Kate's surgery and what it was for deepens.

""Even if she is determined to keep such things private, it wouldn't have hurt for the Princess of Wales to pop her head above the parapet every now and then. It may be too late now. Even if she hits the ground running after Easter, which was the original plan, people are still going to wonder about whether her absence from the public eye was due to a serious medical problem, emotional exhaustion or a combination of both.""

Andersen added, ""It may also be that her medical problem, whatever it is, gave her a new appreciation of what she regards as truly important in life – spending time at home with her children. Kate really is such a pro at handling the press and the public, for her to remain out of sight like this really has to make one wonder: What in God's name is going on?""

In January, the palace announced, ""Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales was admitted to The London Clinic yesterday for planned abdominal surgery. The surgery was successful and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for ten to fourteen days, before returning home to continue her recovery.""

""Kate really is such a pro at handling the press and the public, for her to remain out of sight like this really has to make one wonder: What in God's name is going on?"" — Christopher Andersen

""The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private,"" Kensington Palace said.

Kinsey Schofield, host of the ""To Di For Daily"" podcast, stood firm with the palace and its request for Kate's privacy as she recovers from surgery.

""I think internet trolls and even some royal commentators have been pretty vulgar in their demands for additional details on the status of the Princess of Wales. I’ll say what the Prince and Princess of Wales cannot: It’s none of our damn business,"" Schofield told Fox News Digital.

""Catherine has asked very little from us over the years. Then she asks for privacy to heal until Easter and everyone loses their minds and refuses to give her that peace.""

KING CHARLES REDUCED ‘TO TEARS’ BY CANCER SUPPORT MESSAGES

Despite the princess being a public-facing senior royal family member, Schofield said the recent image of Middleton with her mother is ""a continued violation of her privacy.""

""I’ll say what the Prince and Princess of Wales cannot: It’s none of our damn business."" — Kinsey Schofield

""I would not wish Kate’s world on my worst enemy,"" Schofield said. ""Picked apart by the media and social media with no escape. Not even bed rest is sacred.""

She added, ""Catherine will make a wonderful queen because she has found the power to endure this kind of scrutiny. I could not take it.""

The London Clinic had another royal patient in January, with King Charles III receiving medical attention for a ""corrective procedure"" for an enlarged prostate . The palace later announced his surgery had been a success.

""His Majesty is doing quite well,"" a royal source told Fox News Digital. Two weeks later, Charles, who ascended the throne following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II , revealed a cancer diagnosis.

""During the King’s recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement. ""Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

In the past, Brolin has eviscerated the project, attributing its failure in part to the director, Jimmy Hayward, who Brolin thought was too inexperienced. Last year, the actor told Variety that the movie ""was not successful creatively or monetarily.""

""I mean, everybody knows how I feel about ‘Jonah Hex.’ But the biggest thing with ‘Jonah Hex’ is rushing into hiring somebody. I remember Jeff Robinov, who I’m still close with, who was running Warner Bros. at the time, and he was like, look, you’ve got to get a director in the next two weeks, otherwise we’ve got to can this thing. And then you meet somebody who has a lot of knowledge, Jimmy Hayward, and I remember it didn’t feel right,"" he said.

""I loved that he was excited, but he just didn’t have the experience, and he didn’t treat it like I would imagine somebody would want to treat it — to run back to their house at the end of their every day and watch tonal inspirations and [Martin] Scorsese movies or this or that. He would be out partying instead,"" he said of Hayward.

According to Brolin, Hayward recently apologized for the role he played in the movie's disintegration when the men reconnected. Brolin says Hayward has been battling a particular form of bone cancer, which has resulted in him having facial reconstructive surgeries.

""It reminded me [that] you can't just keep s----ing on somebody,"" Brolin admitted. ""I don't know what the f---'s going on in his life. I mean, total facial reconstruction, the whole thing,"" he told GQ.

Conversely, Brolin is also willing to speak about his more successful projects, including his upcoming movie, ""Dune: Part Two.""

The movie, which bows Friday, wasn't a difficult project for Brolin, 56, to work on. ""Well, obviously, it's a great director, but there are no egos. When you work with great people, there's very little ego,"" he said of the positive experience.

There’s one question on the minds of many royal watchers: Where is Kate Middleton?

Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that the Princess of Wales would remain at a London hospital for up to two weeks after undergoing planned abdominal surgery. The 42-year-old has been recuperating at the family’s Adelaide Cottage in Windsor.

As the princess continues to recover, a flurry of conspiracy theories has emerged on sites like X, formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok, with users speculating about the royal’s whereabouts and health condition.

A spokesperson for Kensington Palace, which handles the household for the Prince and Princess of Wales, told Fox News Digital on Thursday: ""Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the Princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates. The guidance in January stands that the Princess would be recuperating at home in Windsor.""

The spokesperson reiterated the princess is ""doing well.""

KATE MIDDLETON 'WORRIED' AFTER KING CHARLES' CANCER FORCES PRINCE WILLIAM BACK TO WORK: AUTHOR

Kinsey Schofield, host of the ""To Di For Daily"" podcast, told Fox News Digital that when it comes to the mother of three’s health, it’s no one’s business.

""She’s Catherine, the Princess of Wales,"" Schofield argued. ""We were clearly instructed that she will not be made available to the public until Easter, just one month away. Anyone creating trouble on X … is just trying to stir the pot. They increase the risk of jeopardizing the princess’ safety when they start these stupid campaigns. Someone might be inspired to do something asinine for social media notoriety. Get a life. We’ll see her after Easter.""

""If I were in Catherine’s position and had any excuse to disappear for a few weeks, I would absolutely take advantage of it,"" Schofield shared. ""I would relish every second. I would not wish the kind of scrutiny the Princess of Wales faces daily on my worst enemy … all this woman did was marry for love.""

""When it comes to health, death and grief … these individuals do not owe us anything, just let them be,"" Schofield added.

Schofield also pointed out that Middleton’s sister, Pippa, had been spotted in the Caribbean soaking up the sun with her husband and their three children. Schofield noted this implies that the royal’s recovery has been going as expected.

""Common sense says that Pippa Matthews would not be frolicking along a beach in her bathing suit if her sister was in dire straits,"" said Schofield.

It is unclear why the princess needed abdominal surgery. While it is somewhat unusual for members of the royal family to release details about their health, the initial announcement was likely made to avoid speculation about whether events featuring the princess had to be postponed or canceled over the coming weeks.

The palace noted the royal ""is making good progress.""

But that hasn’t stopped the rumors.

Following Middleton’s surgery, journalist Concha Calleja alleged on the popular Spanish news program ""Fiesta"" that the princess was in a coma due to health complications, the U.K. Sunday Times reported.

""The doctors had to make drastic decisions at that moment because of the complications that arose,"" Calleja said, as reported by the outlet. ""The decision was to put her in an induced coma. They had to intubate her. There were serious complications that they didn’t expect because the operation went well, but the postoperative period didn’t go so well.""

The outlet noted that Calleja alleged that Middleton was at one point in ""great danger"" and ""practically an entire hospital"" was set up at her home. Other Spanish outlets reported Calleja's claims.

Soon after, a palace source vehemently denied the report, calling it ""total nonsense.""

""No attempt was made by that journalist to fact-check anything that she said with anyone in the household,"" the source told the outlet. ""It’s fundamentally, totally made-up, and I’ll use polite English here: It’s absolutely not the case.""

A spokesperson for Kensington Palace and Calleja did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

Christopher Andersen, author of ""The King,"" told Fox News Digital that the palace would have benefited from being more transparent about Middleton’s surgery.

""Any thinking person has to wonder what the hell is up in the House of Windsor,"" said Andersen. ""William’s decision not to attend the memorial service for King Constantine of Greece – his godfather and someone who was always very close to England’s royal family – just adds more fuel to the fire. It’s very alarming frankly.""

""It’s difficult to imagine that something more serious isn’t going on,"" Andersen shared. ""It feels that way to me, at any rate, and I’ve been covering the royal family for 50 years.""

""The palace is notoriously tone-deaf,"" he continued. ""Their strategy of telling only part of the story has backfired – and badly. … What is the vague phrase ‘recovering from abdominal surgery’ supposed to mean? It certainly raises more questions than it answers.""

The U.K. and foreign media have been focused on the health of Britain’s senior royals in recent years, first as the late Queen Elizabeth II faded from public view during the last months of her 70-year reign, then when King Charles III ascended the throne at an age when most of his contemporaries were long retired.

Middleton is married to Prince William, who is heir to the British throne.

Since the surgery was planned, it’s implied that it wasn’t an emergency. However, there have been no photos of Middleton leaving the hospital.

Royal photographer and broadcaster Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that the royal family deserves privacy as the princess recovers behind palace doors.

""Why should the palace provide more details regarding Catherine, Princess of Wales?"" said Chard. ""We have been updated about Catherine's major abdominal surgery and that she is recuperating and will be seen after the Easter holidays. We have been updated with the fact that Catherine is doing well, so why should the public be pushing for more information?""

""We have never been privy to every intricate detail regarding our royal family and now that they are offering more information about their lives, the public wants to know more and more,"" Chard shared. ""I think we should give them a break. It makes me wonder if we should revert to the less is more stance and enjoy the mysticism of the royal family.""

Schofield previously claimed to Fox News Digital that Middleton’s recuperation has been going smoothly.

""I have heard that the Princess of Wales has been responding to emails, but everything has been structured so that she is not overwhelmed or disturbed by incoming dialogue,"" said Schofield.

""Kate is not a rule breaker,"" Schofield shared. ""She is going to follow the doctor’s orders but engage when she can, so she doesn’t feel behind. I don’t expect to see her in an official capacity until Easter, but I believe she is engaged behind the scenes.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Kate Middleton was admitted to the hospital for a ""planned abdominal surgery"" last week, but it wasn’t known to insiders ahead of Kensington Palace's Jan. 17 announcement, royal experts suggested to Fox News Digital.

""Just days before the announcement I spoke to sources close to the family and they gave no indication that anything was afoot,"" royal expert Shannon Felton Spence told Fox News Digital following a People magazine report that said her surgery came as a surprise to those close to the royal family.

""I believe the report,"" Spence said, adding that the princess is ""essential to the health and wellness of the monarchy. ""On the human side of it, she is the mother to a future king. She is the partner to a future king. Catherine is the stability, normalcy, and warmth of the family for the next two generations. She is also an invaluable tool for the institution, as she is consistently ranked as one of the most popular members.""

Christopher Andersen, author of ""The King: The Life of Charles III,"" suggested that the main reason the Princess of Wales might have kept her impending surgery quiet was for the sake of her three young children.

HOW KING CHARLES, KATE MIDDLETON'S HEALTH WOES EXPOSE HOLLYWOOD INFLUENCE ON THE MONARCHY: EXPERT

""Kate is a very private person to start with, but she certainly is most concerned with how this will all affect her young children,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""She obviously doesn't want to concern or frighten them. When you're the age of George, Charlotte, or Louis, of course, it's a scary thing to see a parent go into the hospital. That is one of the principal reasons, if not the principal reason, Kate has sought to downplay the surgery.""

But, he said, in reality, keeping her health issue a mystery has fueled rumors.

""Unfortunately, the suddenness of the announcement and the mystery shrouding the Princess's condition have only served to fan the flames of speculation and gossip,"" Andersen said. ""It probably would have been better for the Palace to simply describe the nature of Kate's surgery and get it over with. Until they do, the royal rumor mill will just keep churning away. Compare and contrast this with the King's prostate procedure. Had Charles entered the hospital for a ‘planned surgery’ without further explanation, you can be sure there would have been an uproar.""

KATE MIDDLETON IS SELFLESS DESPITE HOSPITALIZATION, CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER PATIENTS AND KING CHARLES: EXPERT

King Charles III is also expected to be admitted to the hospital for a ""corrective"" procedure related to an enlarged prostate.

Royal author and commentator Duncan Larcombe added that Middleton’s husband, Prince William, has been given the OK by Charles to only carry out light duties, so he can take care of his wife and Princes George, 10, Louis, 5, and Princess Charlotte, 8.

Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that Middleton was admitted to the London Clinic for the planned surgery and would likely remain there for two weeks.

The princess was last seen in public while walking with her family to Church on Christmas Day in Sandringham and there were no signs then that she was in ill health.

The palace has also been tight-lipped about what kind of surgery she’s having beyond that it’s abdominal.

""I haven’t been able to get anything out of anyone about her surgery or condition,"" Spence added.

Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that the news of Charles' procedure has restarted rumors that the king could abdicate in the same way Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II did earlier this month.

He said with William taking care of Kate and Charles, and Sarah Ferguson having their own health issues — Prince Andrew’s ex underwent breast cancer treatment and was just diagnosed with skin cancer — the royal family is ""now depleted of major members … This would have meant a massive increase in duties for Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.""

He said that many royal observers have been concerned about the effect a ""medical catastrophe"" could have on a ""slimmed down monarchy.""

""Thus, with no Andrew or [Prince] Harry and Meghan [Markle], Princess Anne's similar concern that slimming down would not work has come home to roost,"" he added. ""In reality, it points now to the Firm in disarray and perhaps a major rethink in the Windsor household. At a time of U.K. austerity, spending more money on a potential increase in monarchy size may be frowned upon, but in the long term necessary.""

Anderson believes that the princess’ surgery, due to which the palace says she won’t return to royal duties until after Easter, is clearly more of a ""genuine health crisis"" than a ""minor procedure.""

""Just because surgery was ‘planned’ doesn't mean it's routine,"" he added, suggesting: ""The two-week hospital stay and the long recovery period leave no doubt that this was a major medical issue of some sort.""

Middleton, 42, hasn’t had many serious health issues known to the public in the past, except during her three pregnancies when she suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness, and had to be hospitalized.

Kinsey Schofield, host of the ‘To Di For Daily’ podcast, called Middleton an ""integral part of the future of the monarchy.""

Kelly Clarkson realized her connection to the royals is stronger than she thought.

During a recent episode of her talk show, ""The Kelly Clarkson Show,"" the singer had actors Abigail Spencer and Donald Faison on as guests. Spencer and Meghan Markle once starred alongside each other on ""Suits,"" and she revealed to Clarkson that Markle is a fan.

""Meg says hello and that she loves you and that she voted for you on ‘American Idol,’"" Spencer told the host, with Clarkson joking, ""it worked,"" referencing her win on the competition reality show in 2002.

""This was unsolicited. She did not know I was coming on here. We were just chatting, and I was like, 'Oh, I'm going to see Kelly next week,' and she's like, 'I have a message,'"" Spencer said.

KELLY CLARKSON'S WEIGHT LOSS WAS MOTIVATED BY BEING PRE-DIABETIC: 'I WAS A TINY BIT OVERWEIGHT'

The actress further made Clarkson smile when she revealed Michael Bublé referred to her as ""the greatest singer on Earth.""

Spencer and Markle first met when they both starred in season one of ""Suits."" Although Spencer was not a regular, she did appear in many episodes throughout the show, and Markle stayed on until the end of season seven. The two managed to remain very close friends over the years.

""It was 2007, I was doing a pilot for NBC, and I went to read with the people who were supposed to play my best friend. They were testing other actresses,"" Spencer told Clarkson. ""I walk in, I see this beautiful gorgeous creature at the end of the table, and I'm like, ‘Who is that?’ We had an immediate something, you know? And her name is Meghan Markle.""

It seems not all the cast members from ""Suits"" have remained close with Markle since she left the show to marry Prince Harry in 2018.

When speaking with Variety on the red carpet at the Golden Globes, former cast member Gina Torres spoke about how excited she and the rest of the cast, sans Markle, were to be reuniting to present an award that evening. She noted, ""our text thread is insane right now."" When asked if Markle is a part of that text chain, Torres seemingly shaded her former co-star, saying ""We don’t have her number.""

‘We just don’t. So, she’ll see, she’ll watch,"" she added. ""She’ll be happy that we’re here.""

Torres was invited to Markle's wedding to Prince Harry, along with the rest of the cast, including Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gabriel Macht, Rick Hoffman and Spencer. While they were invited to the ceremony, none of them were invited to the reception that evening at Frogmore House.

Earlier this month, Hoffman recently spoke about his experience at the ceremony, during an appearance on the ""Chicks in the Office"" podcast, commenting on the viral photos of him with an ""awful"" look on his face. He went on to explain his expression was due to a ""foul"" smell plaguing him during the ceremony.

""I don't want them to think it's me because I'm so particular when it comes to hygiene. So I'm like, 'Do you guys smell that?' And they're like, 'No.' So now I'm, like, literally by myself, alone on an island, and I'm just going, 'Mother...' And that's [the face] they got [on camera],"" he said.

On the latest cover of Glamour Germany, Klum posed in a satin white Elenareva dress and big white fluffy angel wings, which went from her head to her toes. The look was reminiscent of the classic Victoria's Secret Angel ensemble she wore for several years.

""Wow my wings still fit,"" she captioned an Instagram reel featuring clips of her behind the scenes posing for the camera in different white dresses and wings, as well as a white bikini.

In a second reel posted to Instagram, Klum could be seen posing in her swimsuit and wings, captioning the video, ""this is 50."" She also thanked photographers Luca and Alessandro Morelli for ""making [her] feel great.""

""Yes, I’m 50, but I’m far from dead. I just love colorful, loud things. Maybe that will change at some point, but it can also remain my decision,"" she told the magazine. ""The good thing is that my vision is getting worse and worse, and I can no longer see everything so clearly. I just accept it – there’s nothing you can do about it anyway.""

Klum began working with the lingerie brand in 1998, becoming the first German model to earn angel wings, referring to her time working for the company as ""the best time ever,"" when speaking to the ""Just for Variety"" podcast in August 2022.

During a February 2024 appearance on the ""Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard"" podcast, Klum revealed that in a roundabout way, working for Victoria's Secret paved the way for her becoming the host of both ""Project Runway"" and ""Germany's Next Top Model.""

""I was super hammy, and it started when ‘Access Hollywood’ or ET or any of those TV shows would come, and they wanted to interview us backstage,"" she explained. ""The other girls were like ‘no I don’t want to talk to you,' so they didn't want to talk to the anchors, and I was like 'give me the mic, I'll do it.' So I just ran with them and I would look in the camera like I'm talking to the people at home, and I'm like, ‘OK, now I’m going to interview Stephanie Seymour.'""

She went on to explain the models would actually talk to her, leading Victoria's Secret to ask her to host their show. She ended up hosting the brand's fashion show in 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The model explained she ""was always super nervous"" during a show, but ""also loved the challenge,"" and the opportunity to ""overcome something that was not super easy.""

While she hung up her angel wings in 2010, Klum hosted ""Project Runway"" from 2005 to 2017, and ""Germany's Next Top Model,"" starting in 2006. She also joined the judging panel of ""America's Got Talent,"" in 2013, staying on the panel until 2019, only to return one season later in 2020.

""I called them, because what happened was, Howard Stern was talking about Sharon Osbourne was leaving, and that they were looking for someone to fill her spot,"" she told Shepard. ""Then I was like, I want to go and introduce myself to these people…and then they said, ‘oh yeah, we took someone else,’ because at that point they only had three.""

""So then [I] was like, ‘okay, they picked Mel B, get it, she’s probably more fun,' and this and that, whatever,"" she continued. ""And then they called me and they're like, ‘actually we’re going to have four judges and we do want you also.' That's 10 years ago, and I did 10 seasons.""

""Vanderpump Rules"" star Lala Kent didn't factor in her sperm donor's level of attractiveness when choosing the father of her second child.

On Monday, Kent, 33, dove into the details about her sperm donor process on her ""Give Them Lala"" podcast.

Lala shared that when it came to qualities she was searching for in a potential sperm donor, ""looks were probably the lowest on the totem pole for me.""

She added, ""And I hate to say it, but I also didn’t need them to be extremely smart because I’m not.""

Kent revealed that she has not seen adult photos of the donor she chose to go with because he, as well as other donors, can choose for potential recipients not to see them.

""I did say, ‘What does he look like?’ Because I feel like this baby — and we live in Los Angeles, so that’s great — but the outside world is funny,"" she explained. ""Not everybody is as progressive as we are, and I just felt like, ‘OK, I’m bringing this baby into the world because I so badly want it to be here.

Lala and her ex, Randall Emmett, welcomed Ocean Kent Emmett, in 2021.

""The world is already tough when you come from a totally normal family,"" Lala said. ""I don’t want to make it any tougher for them.""

Kent shared that the donor she did decide to go with has a connection to her two-year-old daughter because both his favorite song and poem ""had to do with the ocean.""

During her podcast episode, Lala explained that her sperm donor facility worked closely with her ""fertility specialist"" that she worked with for her intrauterine insemination (IUI).

""Only 10% of women who go into the California Cryobank to seek out a donor because they want to do parenthood on their own, there’s only 10% of people who, like me, who are like, ‘I just want a child and I need a donor,'"" Kent explained.

In January, Kent opened up to Cosmopolitan about her decision to undergo IUI.

""It’s a road I never thought I would be going down,"" Kent told the outlet at the time. ""I really saw myself in the cookie-cutter relationship and creating a family, but now that the universe has other plans for me, I’m so grateful this was an option.""

On her podcast, Lala revealed that she got pregnant after her first round of IUI. She took several pregnancy tests in December 2023 because it ""didn’t seem real.""

""I just could not fathom that I was having a second baby on try one. I thought I had a little bit more time to sink into like [becoming a mom again]. I really did,"" she said. ""And even my fertility doctor was like, ‘I feel like this was just more of, like, a meet and greet.’ It’s like, ‘Hey, nice to meet you. Here you go. Bye!’ It was so fast.""

Swift surprised fans with an earlier release date for her ""Eras Tour"" concert film on streaming. ""Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour"" was made available for streaming beginning Feb. 14 at 9 p.m. ET.

It’s easily the biggest opening of all time for a concert film, and, not accounting for inflation, surpassed the $73 million that ""Justin Bieber: Never Say Never"" earned in 2011. In today’s dollars, that would be around $102 million.

Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson won't tolerate disrespect on her movie sets, even if you're number one on the call sheet.

The ""Dune: Part Two"" star reflected on a past on-set experience when an A-list star made disparaging remarks toward her.

""I did a film with an absolute idiot of a co-star,"" she admitted to Josh Smith on his ""Reign"" podcast. ""This human being was being so insecure and angry because [they] couldn’t get the scenes out. And I think I was so vulnerable and uncomfortable that I got screamed at and I would cry walking off set.""

TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET LEADS STAR-STUDDED CAST IN NEW 'DUNE' TRAILER

Careful not to give anything away about the co-star, Ferguson detailed the discomfort she felt: ""This person would literally look at me in front of the whole crew and say, ‘You call yourself an actor? This is what I have to work with?… What is this?’ And I stood there just breaking.

""And I remember the next day I walked on and I said, ‘You get off my set.’ That's the first time I [had] ever spoken — I remember being so scared. And I looked at this person and I said, ‘You can F off. I’m gonna work toward a tennis ball. I never want to see you again.’""

Ferguson clarified that neither A-lister Tom Cruise nor Hugh Jackman, with whom she's worked on several projects, were the people she was referencing.

The ""Mission Impossible"" actress has worked alongside some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant in ""Florence Foster Jenkins,"" Emily Blunt in ""The Girl on the Train"" and Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet and Florence Pugh in ""Dune.""

Continuing with her story, Ferguson said she didn't feel support from executives. ""And then I remember the producers came up and said, ‘You can’t do this to No. 1. We have to let this person be on set,’"" she explained. ""And I said, ‘But the person can turn around and I can act to the back [of their] head.’ And I did.

""It took so long for me to get to that. It's within my last 10 years or 12 years. And I've acted since I was 16. But from that moment, I have never let myself get to a point when I've got home and gone, ‘What did, why did that happen?’""

Ferguson's comments have consequently gone viral, prompting one of her former co-stars to seemingly clear his name while giving his support.

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson wrote on X, ""Hate seeing this but love seeing her stand up to bull---. Rebecca was my guardian angel sent from heaven on our set. I love that woman. I’d like to find out who did this.""

The two worked together on the 2014 film ""Hercules.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Concerns over Wendy Williams' health peaked this week ahead of a docuseries exploring the life of the former talk show host who reportedly hasn't been seen by her own family in years.

On Thursday, a representative issued a statement on Wendy's behalf to ""correct inaccurate and hurtful rumors about her health,"" and said the former talk show host was diagnosed with ""primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)"" in 2023.

Williams has largely remained out of the spotlight since her self-titled show was canceled in June 2022, but a new Lifetime documentary attempted to capture Wendy's comeback as she launched a podcast career, only to witness her struggles with alcohol addiction and health issues.

The crew stopped filming in April 2023 when Wendy entered a facility to allegedly treat ""cognitive issues"" reportedly due to alcohol abuse, and her family claimed in an interview with People magazine that they solely communicate with Wendy through a court-appointed legal guardian.

WENDY WILLIAMS PRAISES SUPPORT FROM FANS AND SAYS SHE'S READY TO ‘FALL IN LOVE’ AFTER HEALTH SCARE

""The people who love her cannot see her,"" Wendy's sister Wanda told People. ""I think the big [question] is: How the hell did we get here?""

""We've all seen the images over the last few months — and, really, few years — of what has seemed like a spiral for my aunt,"" her niece, Alex Finnie, said. ""It was shocking and heartbreaking to see her in this state.""

While chatting with the women on ""The View"" on Thursday, Finnie admitted Williams can't be directly contacted by family and Wendy is required to call them from a blocked number.

""She went into where she is now between April and May of last year,"" Finnie said. ""We went months before we were finally able to get a call.""

She added, ""I say this honestly, we went through birthdays, we went through the holidays, we went through illness. There was a period when my grandfather was in the hospital — there was no way to contact her and let her know what was going on with her 93-year-old father.""

WHAT IS FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA, THE DIAGNOSIS BRUCE WILLIS HAS RECEIVED?

During one scene of the ""Where is Wendy Williams?"" documentary, Williams asked her driver to take her to the former studio where she hosted her daily talk show. She had forgotten they had driven past the studio only moments before.

""I don’t know what the hell is going on,"" her driver said in the clip, per People. ""I think she’s losing memory. She doesn’t know who I am sometimes.""

A statement released on Thursday revealed Wendy is suffering from frontotemporal dementia.

""Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy's ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy's condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions,"" the statement said.

""In 2023, after undergoing a battery of medical tests, Wendy was officially diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Aphasia, a condition affecting language and communication abilities, and frontotemporal dementia, a progressive disorder impacting behavior and cognitive functions, have already presented significant hurdles in Wendy's life.""

WENDY WILLIAMS DENIES WELLS FARGO'S ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HER MENTAL HEALTH, CLAIMS ‘FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION’

Specialists at Weill Cornell Medicine are credited as part of her ""current care team"" who help Wendy ""receive the medical care she requires.""

""The decision to share this news was difficult and made after careful consideration, not only to advocate for understanding and compassion for Wendy, but to raise awareness about aphasia and frontotemporal dementia and support the thousands of others facing similar circumstances,"" the statement said. ""Unfortunately, many individuals diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia face stigma and misunderstanding, particularly when they begin to exhibit behavioral changes but have not yet received a diagnosis.

""Wendy is still able to do many things for herself. Most importantly she maintains her trademark sense of humor and is receiving the care she requires to make sure she is protected and that her needs are addressed. She is appreciative of the many kind thoughts and good wishes being sent her way.""

Most notably, actor Bruce Willis was diagnosed in 2022 with the brain disorder which affects communication. FTD is ""the result of damage to neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain,"" according to the National Institute on Aging. ""Many possible symptoms can result, including unusual behaviors, emotional problems, trouble communicating, difficulty with work, or difficulty with walking.""

Wendy's public health battles began years ago. Williams began her journey in the entertainment industry in the '90s on radio airwaves before making her television debut with her self-titled talk show in 2008.

Before long, Williams' alcohol addiction behind the scenes became an issue on live television. ""She would be drunk on air,"" a source told People. ""Slowly, we started being like, ‘What’s going on with her?’""

She claimed a fainting episode while dressed as the Statue of Liberty in 2017 was due to her Graves disease. By 2019, Williams revealed past issues with a cocaine addiction lead her to living in a sober facility.

""You know me for being a very open and honest person. You know Kevin and I have the Hunter Foundation for the good of the people and we recently launched out 888-HUNTER number for people who are in the struggle of addiction. Well, for some time now, and even today and beyond, I have been living in a sober house,"" she said during a 2019 episode of her show.

""When you see me come to work glammed up, right after the show, I do Pilates ... You know I’ve had a struggle with cocaine in the past,"" she said. ""I never went to a place to get treatment. I don't know how. God was just sitting on my shoulder and I just stopped … there are people in your family, it might be you … I want you to know more of the story.""

At the same time, Williams filed for divorce from her husband of 21 years, Kevin Hunter, after discovering he had fathered a child with another woman. Wendy and Kevin have one son together, Kevin Jr.

""[Wendy's mom] Shirley, may she rest in peace, would always remind me that your aunt would trade everything that she has — every dime, every car, every wig — to be able to have a strong loving household and a loving husband,"" Alex told People. ""That was ripped from her right after her son had to go off to college [in 2018]. Emotionally, it was just a lot. It was too much for her world.""

The pandemic also hit Williams hard, and she was forced to take a hiatus from the show to receive treatment for Graves' disease symptoms in May 2020, and returned to television in September.

""Recently, Wendy has been dealing with symptoms from her Graves’ disease, which is causing fatigue. In consultation with her doctor and as a precautionary measure, she will be taking some time off as she continues to receive treatment,"" a spokesperson from ""The Wendy Williams Show"" said in a statement at the time.

Wendy never returned to her show. In 2022, a legal guardian was appointed over her finances and health, and court documents were sealed. Wendy later filed a temporary restraining order against Wells Fargo asking the court to ""reopen any frozen accounts or assets"" and grant Williams ""access to any and all accompanying statements.""

According to Williams' filings to the court, the bank's move reportedly came after Williams' former financial adviser alleged that Williams ""was of unsound mind.""

""All I know is that Wendy and her team walked into the courtroom one way, and they walked out, and the family is completely excluded,"" Wanda told People. Meanwhile, in response to ABC News, Wells Fargo shared a statement, writing, ""This matter was conducted under seal. Any claims against Wells Fargo have been dismissed.""

In February 2023, sources told Page Six it appeared as though Wendy was filming a ""mystery project"" when she appeared at the trendy Fresco by Scotto restaurant with ""approximately 30 people in the crew. Lights, cameras, audio, producers, etc. [It] looked like a reality show.""

""How did she go from this aunt or sister that we love and is healthy one minute to this person who’s in and out of the hospital?"" Wanda said. ""How is that system better than the system the family could put in place? This system is broken.""

Williams' son reportedly came under scrutiny for his spending but, in the documentary, denies that he ever exploited her. ""I've never taken [money] without her consent,"" he said, per People.

""I said [to the producers], ‘No, she’s not coming back up because she needs to get better,’"" Kevin Jr. said in the documentary. ""I made sure that business was always on the back burner and that health was the number one priority.""

Wanda added, ""There is not a person in this family who doesn’t want the same thing for Wendy, and that is her health."" Her niece, Alex, said, ""She can’t wait to start the next chapter of her life.""

During a Good Morning America interview, Alex was asked if there were any worries from the family that Wendy may be exploited by this documentary, Alex didn't hesitate to respond.

""My aunt is executive producer of this documentary,"" Alex told Good Morning America. ""When I finally talked with her, and I said to her, 'Aunt Wendy, why do you want to do this? You know, you're clearly, the health piece, all of that has to be addressed. Is now the right time? And she said, 'Now is the perfect time because I want to take ownership of my story.""

Alex added, ""I said I wasn't gonna cry – because I feel like I've cried enough over the last year and a half. But what people are gonna see is a broken woman who has had the world on her shoulders for so long – and just cracked.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Taylor Swift's father, Scott, has been accused of punching an Australian photographer early Tuesday morning.

The New South Wales police department confirmed that an investigation has been launched into Scott after he allegedly assaulted Ben McDonald, 51, at a ferry wharf in Sydney.

Swift's spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""Two individuals were aggressively pushing their way towards Taylor, grabbing at her security personnel, and threatening to throw a female staff member into the water.""

The alleged assault occurred at 2:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, and McDonald did not require medical attention.

McDonald told the Daily Mail that Scott, 71, ""charged"" at him after the father-daughter duo got off their yacht at the end of the night.

""She [Taylor] got off the boat, she walked towards security guards who were shoving umbrellas in our faces, and then he charged,"" McDonald told the outlet.

McDonald alleged that Scott struck him on the left side of his face, leaving him with ""very sore chops.""

The Australian photographer told the outlet that he didn't do anything to provoke a reaction from Scott.

""He probably decided he needed to defend his daughter, for some reason,"" McDonald told the Daily Mail. ""In 23 years I have never seen anything like it.""

Scott has been a staple at his daughter's shows during her Eras Tour. In November, Taylor famously changed the lyrics to her hit ""Karma"" for her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who attended the show with Swift's dad.

During her performance in Argentina, Swift sweetly changed the lyrics to her song ""Karma"" to reference her new beau. ""Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,"" she sang.

The topic was addressed on Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast, ""New Heights.""

""You mean ‘Karma’?"" Travis replied. ""Yeah no, I had no clue that — well, I might have had a little bit of a clue, but definitely when I heard it come out of her mouth, still shocked me… I was like, ‘Oh… she really just said that?’""

""You were so shocked you left Scott [Swift] hanging. Scott's over here looking for a high-five,"" Jason joked, referencing a video that went viral of the two men reacting to the lyric change. In the video, Scott can be seen trying to give Travis a celebratory high-five.

""Yeah, Mr. Swift, I apologize, big guy. Aw man, I missed that. I never miss a high-five, too. Big high-five guy! It's the most electric thing you can do at an event… So sorry,"" he reiterated.

Jason noted that Scott, historically a Philadelphia Eagles fan, was wearing a Kansas City Chiefs lanyard at a Swift concert. Jason is currently a center for the Eagles.

""You're gonna let this man's devilishly good looks and relationship with your daughter sway you from a lifetime of fandom, Scott?"" Jason teased.

""I might have persuaded him at dinner the night before when I met him,"" Travis clarified.

In early 2020, the couple kicked off their new year by stepping down from their royal duties as senior members of the family. Since then, the pair, and the duchess herself, have caused quite a stir in the media, often making headlines.

But before Markle was introduced to Harry in 2016, she was an actress who had only recently garnered Hollywood’s attention.

These are the television shows and movies Markle acted in before quitting showbiz and making a royal name for herself.

She left the show only while dating Harry. The pair were often thrust into the spotlight. It has been speculated that her role in ""Suits"" while dating Harry was limited due to her connection with the royal family.

While the popular series ""Suits"" drew new audiences when Markle and Harry became engaged, the show took off early on and the success is not credited to her supporting role as a paralegal.

Markle played Rachel Zane, a bombshell paralegal turned educated lawyer. In the series, she is introduced to the co-lead, Michael Ross, played by Patrick J. Adams, early on in the series. The two become a pair and her role ends when the two wed on the show.

In the series in 2008, Markle is seen in a car with another actor performing a racy sex act. The moment isn’t memorable to most cameo actors and actresses. However, Markle’s direct relationship with the royal family made it one to gab about.

Tish Cyrus revealed that she might have been a ""better parent"" if she had smoked weed while her kids were growing up.

Tish, 56, shares three kids with ex-husband Billy Ray Cyrus – Miley Cyrus, Braison and Noah Cyrus. The music manager also shares two kids – Brandi and Trace – with her first husband, Baxter Neal Helson.

""I actually feel like I would’ve been . . . I didn’t smoke pot when I had kids,"" Tish said during her podcast, ""Sorry We're Stoned,"" which she hosts with her daughter Brandi. ""I didn’t start smoking until I was like 46.""

""And so I think I would’ve been a better parent if I would’ve smoked then,"" she explained. ""I think I would’ve been . . . like, I don’t know, school projects, I would’ve felt more fun.""

Tish and Brandi were joined by rapper Wiz Khalifa for the Thursday episode, where they recalled his 2013 collaboration with Miley, ""23.""

""She loved weed. And at that time, I didn’t smoke weed,"" Tish recalled. ""And I was not happy with her.""

Miley has since quit smoking weed. She revealed her decision during an interview with Billboard in 2017.

""I haven’t smoked weed in three weeks, which is the longest I’ve ever [gone without it],"" the ""Hannah Montana"" star said at the time. ""I’m not doing drugs, I’m not drinking, I’m completely clean right now! That was just something that I wanted to do.""

The change was ""easy"" to make for Miley. ""When I want something, it’s f--king easy for me,"" she told the outlet. ""But if anyone told me not to smoke, I would have not done it. It’s because it was on my time. I know exactly where I am right now.""

Tish and her family have been fielding speculation of a family fallout since her divorce from Billy Ray in 2022.

The former couple's divorce filing was not their first. Billy Ray filed for divorce in 2010, but the two worked things out and reconciled a year later. In June 2013, Tish filed for divorce again, but the couple reunited a month later.

When Billy Ray married new wife Firerose in October last year, Miley was absent.

Meanwhile, Noah and with her brother Braison were noticeably absent from their mother's wedding to Dominic Purcell. The siblings reportedly spent their mother's wedding day together, posting a since-expired Instagram story of an outing to Walmart, where Noah wore a Billy Ray shirt.

Miley served as her mother's maid of honor for the big moment and walked Tish down the aisle during the Malibu nuptials.

Actor Dominic Purcell had a connection to the Cyrus family before he married Tish Cyrus, a source claims to Fox News Digital.

Tish began dating Purcell in 2022. They were married last August, but according to a source who spoke with Fox News Digital, Purcell had a casual relationship with Tish's youngest daughter, Noah, before getting together with his current wife.

As the source explained, Noah and Purcell saw each other on and off, but they had cut ties completely when Tish started seeing him. She was aware of his previous relationship with Noah when she decided to pursue her own romance with him.

Tish seemed to address the rumors about Noah and Purcell that began circulating earlier this week on her podcast, ""Sorry We're Stoned."" She co-hosts the show with daughter Brandi Cyrus, and at one point during the show, they asked guest Wiz Khalifa to name the craziest rumor he'd ever heard about himself.

He didn't have an answer, but Brandi took the opportunity to tease Tish, asking, ""Mother, would you like to answer that?""

""I don't think …"" Tish began before trailing off. Brandi asked again if there were any crazy rumors about her, and she said, ""I don't think so.""

The question came as part of a game the pair plays on their podcast – if someone passes on answering a question, that person has to ""toke.""

""Oh, I'm toking,"" Tish said adamantly. ""I'm absolutely toking on that one.""

Rumors about the alleged issues between Tish and Noah go back to Tish's wedding to Purcell. Noah and her brother, Braison, didn't attend, and instead she posted a photo of the two of them at Walmart together. She was wearing a Billy Ray Cyrus shirt. Billy Ray and Tish were divorced in 2022 after nearly 30 years of marriage.

Fox News Digital's source suggested that Noah's absence had something to do with her previous relationship with Purcell.

Jamie Foxx is teasing his return to stand-up comedy nearly a year after his health scare.

On Wednesday, the 56-year-old shared a throwback video of himself performing one of his stand-up specials impersonating the late musician, Prince, on Instagram. In Foxx's caption, he announced that he has plans to return to the stage.

""PRINCE singing the Brady Bunch theme song was a moment… I’m planning on bringing more moments,"" he began. ""Going to get on somebody’s stage somewhere near you. I got some jokes, and a story to tell…""

Foxx got started in Hollywood based on his stand-up career. In the early 1990s, he was a cast regular on ""In Living Color."" Between 1993 and 2003, Foxx released three comedy specials.

JAMIE FOXX SAYS HE'S 'THANKFUL' AFTER MEDICAL COMPLICATION, ANTISEMITIC CONTROVERSY

On top of his film success, Foxx was a star in the music industry and released five studio albums between 1994 and 2005.

The special that Foxx shared on Instagram Wednesday was filmed in 2002 in Oakland, California. During the act, the comedian performed as he believed different musicians would perform ""The Brady Bunch"" theme song.

Foxx has been outspoken about his adoration for Prince, who died in 2016. The following year, the actor was a guest on ""The Howard Stern Show,"" where he admitted he was ""in awe of"" Prince when he first met him on New Year's Eve in 1998.

""All my cool went out the window - I started naming the albums, I'm f---king up the titles,"" Foxx told Stern in 2017. ""He was so cool, and he knew I was shook.""

The ""Django Unchained"" star has not performed stand-up comedy in several years due to his successful acting career.

He also battled health concerns last year. In April, Foxx was hospitalized with an undisclosed health issue. His daughter, Corinne Foxx, shared on social media that, ""Luckily, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery.

""We know how beloved he is and appreciate your prayers. The family asks for privacy during this time.""

Details were scarce, and speculation about Foxx’s condition ran wild, but Corinne shut down some rumors in May with an update, saying on her Instagram story at the time, ""My Dad has been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating"" and denying reports the family was preparing for ""the worst.""

""In fact,"" she continued, ""he was playing pickleball yesterday! Thanks for everyone's prayers and support!""

In July, Foxx broke his silence with a post on Instagram.

""I cannot even begin to tell you how far it took me and how it brought me back. I went through something that I thought I would never, ever go through,"" he told fans.

He also said he had not kept fans updated until then because he ""didn't want you to see me like that.""

""I want you to see me laughing, having a good time, partying, cracking a joke, doing a movie, a television show,"" the Oscar winner said.

""I just didn’t want you to see me with tubes running out of me and trying to figure out if I was going to make it through.""

Foxx denied rumors he had been blinded or paralyzed but admitted he ""did go to hell and back.""

""My road to recovery had some potholes as well, but I'm coming back, and I’m able to work,"" he said.

Foxx was in the middle of filming a movie for Netflix with Cameron Diaz when his health took a toll. People magazine reported that the actors were spotted back on-set in January. The streaming service has teased that ""Back in Action"" will debut on the platform in 2024.

2023 has been the year of the weight loss drug, specifically Ozempic.

Ozempic was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, but the medication has increasingly been prescribed off-brand for weight loss, along with several other similar medications.

Weight loss drugs have caused a stir of controversy in Hollywood, with some celebrities being accused of using them and denying it, while others, like Oprah Winfrey and Sharon Osbourne, have admitted to using them and they are sharing the impact they’ve had.

Read on for the stars who have confessed to using Ozempic or other weight loss drugs.

Oprah Winfrey

Oprah Winfrey recently admitted to using medication to combat a lifelong battle with her fluctuating weight.

Winfrey explained to People, ""I realized I’d been blaming myself all these years for being overweight, and I have a predisposition that no amount of willpower is going to control. Obesity is a disease. It’s not about willpower – it's about the brain.""

""The fact that there's a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for,"" Winfrey said. ""I’m absolutely done with the shaming from other people and particularly myself.""

The former talk show host, who never specified which medication she was using, said she also made lifestyle changes like hiking regularly, as well as stopping eating at 4 o’clock, drinking a gallon of water a day, and using ""the Weight Watchers principles of counting points.""

Winfrey’s choice and openness about using weight loss medication have been met with mixed reactions, in part from her position as an ambassador for Weight Watchers (WW) since 2017.

One person wrote on social media, ""What happened to Weight Watchers? Too much work?""

""I guess weight watchers don't work,.. right Oprah!!"" wrote another.

""I know Oprah's metabolism is a mess. She's been a spokesperson for every weight-loss product, except surgery, since the 80s."" wrote a third.

Others were more supportive. ""Here’s the thing: she didn’t have to lose her weight according to anyone else’s expectations or standards. She did what worked FOR HER. Y’all gonna have to figure out what works for you. That’s not on Oprah,"" wrote a fan.

Sharon Osbourne

Sharon Osbourne has been open about her use of Ozempic and the positive and negative effects she’s experienced.

In November, the 70-year-old told the Daily Mail she was ""too gaunt and I can’t put any weight on,"" noting she weighed less than 100 pounds following her use of Ozempic.

""Be careful what you wish for,"" she added.

The television personality said she started Ozempic last December and has been off it ""for a while now,"" but seems to continue losing weight.

""You can lose so much weight and it’s easy to become addicted to that, which is very dangerous. I couldn’t stop losing weight and now I’ve lost 42 pounds and I can’t afford to lose any more,"" she said.

""It’s different for everybody, but for me, the first few weeks was f---ing s--- because you just throw up all the time. You feel so nauseous,"" Osbourne said.

""After a couple of weeks, it goes,"" she added, ""and then you’re just fine, you feel nothing. Just not hungry.""

Osbourne also revealed she used to slide back into bad habits, noting she’s ""always had a weight problem,"" but hasn’t after being on Ozempic. ""Usually I do, I’ll give it a couple of weeks and then I’m like, f--- it, I’ll have pasta,"" she said.

Amy Schumer

Amy Schumer admitted she’d tried Ozempic, and took other celebrities to task for supposedly not being truthful about their use of the medication.

On an episode of ""Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"" in April, the comedian blasted stars for saying they lost weight by simply eating ""smaller portions"" and ""lying"" about using the injectable drug.

""You are on Ozempic or one of those things or you got work done. Just stop"" she said.

Schumer said she tried it, but experienced bad side effects.

""It's like, you know, you try it. And I was one of those people that felt so sick and couldn’t play with my son. I was so skinny, and he’s throwing a ball at me and [I couldn’t],"" adding, ""And you're like, ‘OK, this isn’t livable for me.'""

He added, ""And I ain't letting it go!""

Morgan explained he takes weekly injections ""every Thursday,"" and said ""It cuts my appetite in half. Now I only eat half a bag of Doritos.""

Chelsea Handler admitted to being on Ozempic, but not realizing it at first.

""My anti-aging doctor just hands it out to anybody, right,"" the comedian told Alex Cooper on her ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast. ""And obviously now I can’t say her name, but I didn’t even know I was on it.""

She added her doctor told her, ""'If you ever want to drop five pounds, this is good.'""

Handler also experienced nausea, recalling that she injected the drug following a trip to Spain during a meeting with a friend. Her friend said, ""I’m not really eating anything, I’m so nauseous, I’m on Ozempic,"" Handler explained. ""I was like, ‘Oh, I’m kind of nauseous, too,’ and I’m like, ‘But I’m not on Ozempic,’ and she’s like, ‘Are you sure?’"" The friend noted she was on the drug after Handler said she was using semaglutide, the generic name for the drug.

Handler opted to discontinue using the drug, saying it was ""silly because it's for heavy people.""

""That’s too irresponsible,"" she added. ""I’m an irresponsible drug user, but I’m not going to take a diabetic drug … I tried it, and I’m not going to do that.""

""About two months ago my doctor put me on – not Ozempic, Mounjaro – and Repatha,"" she explained. ""One I do every other week and one I do once a week.""

The former talk show host and comedian said she made other lifestyle changes, like stopping a regular soda habit.

""I really stopped drinking five or six Cokes a day. All I drink is water now,"" O'Donnell said.

She also said, ""I'm not eating sugar as much as I can. My appetite has decreased significantly. It's probably the meds. And I'm trying to move more. So, all those things combined, that's what it is.""

In another video, O’Donnell noted that she thinks less about food, saying, ""Yeah, it's funny because I used to think about it a lot and now I don't think about it at all. It's like it alters something in your thought process. I don't know, it's weird, right?""

There are three foods Susan Lucci eats every day.

The ""All My Children"" alum told Fox News Digital there are certain ingredients she lives on and always has in stock in her fridge.

""Salmon, blueberries and kale,"" the actress said of her clean diet. ""My doctor told me, ‘You keep doing what you’re doing because something good will come from that.'""

SUSAN LUCCI, 76, HAS NO PLANS TO SLOW DOWN, CALLS RETIREMENT A 'DIRTY WORD'

The 77-year-old, a longtime ambassador of the American Heart Association, follows the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in fresh fruits, vegetables and fish.

""It started with superfoods,"" she explained. ""A book about it came out, and my friend gave it to me. She was already eating that way and she looked great. And as I educated myself, I realized that’s how I ate. … I do have the occasional pasta and carbs. I love carbs. … But the key is moderation.

""I try to avoid foods that are full of cholesterol,"" Lucci added. ""I love cheese, but I don’t eat much of it, hardly ever. I love ice cream, but I moderate it. It’s all about moderation. For the most part, I avoid foods that can lead to cholesterol buildup. My husband was an executive chef trained in Europe. I remember I would eat everything that he was cooking. It was like monopoly food. And I did build up cholesterol. … It’s not about being trendy. It’s about being your best self.""

Lucci also follows a no-nonsense workout regimen, one she discovered 27 years ago.

""I do Pilates every day,"" the star said. ""The time depends on my schedule for the day and how early my day starts. But I get up early every day just to accommodate it. I do Pilates at least five days a week. Sometimes, it’s six days a week because it’s good to come at your muscles differently. I sometimes add weights for part of it or work out on a Pilates chair, which gives you a cardio workout as well. But I sometimes add light weights. I don’t want to bulk up. Everybody’s different, but that’s what works for me. I do 30 reps each.

""Pilates may look so easy, but it requires a lot of strength,"" she said. ""My good friend, who was my trainer for many years … her husband is a fitness buff. He would look at us, shake his head and go, ‘What are you doing?’ Because it does look easy. It does look like you’re not going to get any benefits from it at all. But, personally, there’s something to this for sure.""

Lucci has a good reason to be a big-time health advocate. She experienced cardiac trauma in 2018 when she began experiencing intense chest pains. She thought nothing of it.

""I remember my husband and I were waiting to be seated at a restaurant in October,"" she recalled. ""The waiter was coming to see us when I felt a little bit of pressure on my chest, which I had never felt before. It was very mild, so I thought, ‘It must be because the holidays are upon us. How many presents do I need to buy?’ I just thought it was holiday stress. So I ignored it, as many of us do as women. I just thought, ‘It’ll go away.’""

The same incident occurred a couple of weeks later at a different restaurant.

""I felt this pressure on my chest, only this time it was radiating around my rib cage to my back,"" said Lucci. ""I had never experienced that either. I’ve never had any kind of medical issue. So, again, I thought, ‘My bra is on too tight.’ I knew it wasn’t. I went home, I checked and it wasn’t that. And the pressure just stopped.""

A week later, Lucci went to shop for a pal at a boutique. As the salesperson gathered her things, Lucci felt a sharp pressure on her chest. She couldn’t ignore it any longer.

""I remember many years ago reading a story of a woman who spoke about her symptoms of a heart attack and how they can be different from men,"" said Lucci. ""I remember she said something about the feeling of an elephant pressing on her chest. That’s what I was feeling.

""I sat down on a little bench in the boutique,"" said Lucci. ""The manager came over and asked me if I was OK. She knew I wasn’t OK. She then said, ‘Susan, my car is right outside. … I could get you to the hospital faster than an ambulance can arrive.’ … I didn’t even have a cardiologist. I never knew I needed one.""

A scan revealed that Lucci had a 90% blockage in her main artery to her heart. According to her medical team, had she not acted on her symptoms, she would have succumbed to ""the widowmaker,"" a fatal heart attack. Lucci could have gone to bed that evening and not woken up. Doctors inserted two stents.

Lucci learned her condition was hereditary from her father’s side.

""I was totally in shock,"" she said. ""I didn’t have pain. It was just pressure. Everyone was surprised. You think with my lifestyle, how could this happen? Well, it could. And, in my case, it was family history. At the time, my mother was 100 years old. We all thought that I had my mother’s genes. Like her, I never had a health issue or anything. But it turned out that I had my dad’s genes. I didn’t know. … It's so important to have an understanding of your family's medical history.

""The doctor said to me, ‘You keep on doing what you’re doing because it really is hereditary. You got this from your family history.'""

A couple of years later, Lucci began experiencing a sharp pain in her jaw. This time, she didn’t think twice and called her cardiologist. She had another stent inserted that same night.

""I felt so ashamed,"" Lucci admitted. ""Here I was telling women to be aware of their symptoms, and I was starting to slip back into my old behavior, not wanting to believe it was anything significant. But it turned out that jaw pain can be another symptom for women. And I’m so thankful that I was mindful.""

Today, Lucci is thankful. In December, she was presented a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 50th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. The award was presented by Shemar Moore, who also gave Lucci her first Daytime Emmy in 1999 after 19 nominations dating back to 1978.

""I have two Emmys now,"" Lucci boasted. ""When I won the first Emmy, I kept it on top of a chest of drawers in the bedroom, so I could see it every day. It was so hard for me to believe that I had finally won. But only I could see it. I have never been one to display any awards on the main floor of the house. I wanted my children to see me as their mother. I didn’t want them to ever think of the actress in their home. I was their mother, and that’s the only role I wanted for them.""

Lucci said she will continue to raise awareness of heart health for women in hopes she can help save a life.

""My message for women is to listen to your body,"" she said. ""Always put yourself on your to-do list. We don’t even put ourselves on the list. I’m lucky I’m here to tell my story.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The original ""Wonder Woman"" is still navigating her grief, and finding new ways to honor her late love.

While she's best known for her time on the small screen, Carter is also a singer, and has written a new song as a tribute to Altman.

""The soul of the song is about how you miss a person so much, because they're such a presence in your life that it's almost impossible to imagine that you won't physically see them again in this life,"" she told People magazine.

""You wonder, 'How can I communicate with you? Where are you? You didn't just die — there's too much of you left on this earth, too many people that love you.'""

‘WONDER WOMAN' STAR LYNDA CARTER SPEAKS OUT ON HUSBAND ROBERT A. ALTMAN'S DEATH: 'HE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE'

On Valentine's Day, Carter announced her new single, ""Letters from Earth,"" on her social media.

""I've been singing for over 50 years,"" she told the outlet. ""I started singing in clubs when I was 14, and was writing music before I became an actor.""

To this day, she has a hard time resolving that Altman isn't just off somewhere else.

""He was the great love of my life,"" she prefaced to People. ""I think of him every day. There's so much of my day to day where I find myself thinking, 'Oh Robert will know.' Or if I'm on a flight, I still expect him to text to ask, ‘Did you land safely? Was everything alright?’""

""These letters are almost a prayer to your loved one. Hopefully people will relate to it. It's a celebration of love, as much as it is heartbreaking.""

Carter married Altman, a video game executive and lawyer, in 1984. The couple shared son James and daughter Jessica together.

Even Adam Sandler sometimes gets nervous when meeting A-list celebrities.

Most notably, Taylor Swift. The ""Spaceman"" actor revealed he gets a ""little f---ing jumpy"" around the pop star in a new interview.

""Taylor Swift because of what she means to my kids, I get a little f---ing jumpy, because I don't want to blow it for my kids,"" Sandler said during an appearance on SiriusXM's ""Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend."" ""I talk a little too loud. I don't act as cool as I can.""

""I can see that,"" O'Brien responded, noting how famous Swift has become. ""I mean, she's this whole other level now.""

Sandler compared Swift to The Beatles, specifically how people knew all of their songs.

""People talk about The Beatles of it all and her. I mean, f---, so many smash hits. There's not a word my kids don't know.""

O'Brien admitted his daughter knows all of Swift's songs as well.

""I know them too, by the way,"" Sandler quipped, before adding, ""but they know them inside and out. But remember The Beatles… every single song on the record you knew — that's Taylor Swift too. There's not a song you skip. You go, ‘Oh that one's pretty cool.'""

Swift has cemented her place among The Beatles after breaking multiple records set by the band. In July 2023, the ""Midnights"" singer matched one of the band's most impressive records — having three songs from three different albums within the Billboard Hot 100.

At that time, ""I Can See You (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)"" on ""Speak Now (Taylor's Version)"" landed at No. 5, ""Cruel Summer"" from ""Lover"" at No. 9, and ""Karma"" with Ice Spice from ""Midnights"" at No. 10.

The Beatles also accomplished this feat in February 1964, according to Forbes.

""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" from ""Meet The Beatles"" as No. 1, ""She Loves You"" from ""The Beatles' Second Album"" at No. 2, and ""Please Please Me"" from ""Introducing... The Beatles"" at No. 6.

Richard Lewis, the legendary stand-up comedian who also starred alongside Larry David on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" has died. He was 76.

According to his publicist, Jeff Abraham of Jonas Public Relations, Lewis died peacefully at his home in Los Angeles on Tuesday night after suffering a heart attack.

Abraham stated, ""His wife, Joyce Lapinsky, thanks everyone for all the love, friendship and support and asks for privacy at this time.""

He noted that Lewis announced he was living with Parkinson's disease in April 2023, and can currently be seen co-starring in the final season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" on HBO with creator and star Larry David.

David, in a statement via an HBO spokesperson, expressed his sadness at the loss of his dear friend and co-star.

""Richard and I were born three days apart in the same hospital and for most of my life he’s been like a brother to me. He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest. But today he made me sob and for that I’ll never forgive him,"" David said.

Their ""Curb"" co-star Cheryl Hines also expressed her heartbreak over Lewis' death.

""When I was young I had the biggest crush on Richard Lewis. He was the funniest person on stage and the most handsome comedian. Then when I was cast on ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm,’ I got to work with him and it was a dream come true,"" Hines said in a statement.

She continued, ""Through the years I learned who Richard really was and the gifts he gave. Yes, he was the comedian I fell in love with, but he was also one of the most loving people I know. He would take time to tell the people he loved what they meant to him — especially in recent years. In between takes on ‘Curb,' he would tell me how special I was to him and how much he loved me.""

Hines concluded, ""To be loved by Richard Lewis. A true gift. I love you Richard.""

HBO also issued a statement, saying, ""We are heartbroken to learn that Richard Lewis has passed away. His comedic brilliance, wit and talent were unmatched. Richard will always be a cherished member of the HBO and ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ families, our heartfelt condolences go out to his family, friends and all the fans who could count on Richard to brighten their days with laughter.""

Lewis was born in New York City in 1947 and raised in New Jersey, the youngest of three children.

His stand-up career took off in the 1970s and '80s, and he earned the nickname ""The Prince of Pain"" for his melancholy topics and pouring his anguish and torment on stage.

Comedy Central named Lewis one of the top 50 stand-up comedians of all time, and he earned a place on GQ magazine’s list of the ""20th Century’s Most Influential Humorists."" He also lent his humor for charity causes, including Comic Relief and Comedy Gives Back.

In 1989, he delivered a memorable performance at Carnegie Hall, appearing on stage with taped-together yellow legal pad papers for a two and a half hour set that led to two standing ovations.

The ""Howard Stern"" regular also produced comedy specials for HBO and Showtime, including ""I’m in Pain,"" ""I’m Exhausted, I’m Doomed,"" and ""Richard Lewis: The Magical Misery Tour.""

In addition to stand-up, Lewis acted regularly. He co-starred on the ABC series ""Anything But Love"" with Jamie Lee Curtis, and appeared in films like Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" as a deeply neurotic Prince John. Lewis also dabbled in dramatic roles, with a cameo in the Nicolas Cage drama ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" which led to his own indie film, ""Drunks,"" a picture that dealt with alcoholism.

Lewis was also open in his comedy about his addiction, alcohol and mental health struggles, something he detailed in his 2008 memoir ""The Other Great Depression"" and a follow-up, ""Reflections From Hell: Richard Lewis' Guide on How Not to Live,"" released in 2015.

The comedian sought treatment in 1994 for drugs and alcohol after a cocaine overdose and had been sober since.

In 2000, Lewis joined the recurring cast of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" created and written by and starring his friend David. Lewis played a fictionalized version of himself across the show's 12 seasons.

Last year, Lewis confirmed he would appear in the show's 12th season, after having had to miss out most of the previous season to recover from surgery, and had recently completed filming.

He also addressed his Parkinson's diagnosis and decision to retire from stand-up on X, saying in a video, ""I'm finished with stand-up, I'm focusing on writing and acting.""

Lewis added, ""I have Parkinson's disease, but I'm under a doctor's care and everything is cool, and I love my wife, I love my little puppy dog, and I love all my friends and my fans, and now you know where it's been at the last three and a half years.""

Emily Blunt and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson are showing support for their former co-star, Rebecca Ferguson, after she reveled she was disrespected on a movie set.

Ferguson shared on Josh Smith's ""Reign"" podcast Monday that she had a run-in with ""an absolute idiot of a co-star"" who screamed at her on set.

Following Ferguson's confession, Johnson took to X, formerly Twitter, to show support for his ""guardian angel sent from heaven.""

""Hate seeing this but love seeing her stand up to bulls--t,"" Johnson wrote. ""Rebecca was my guardian angel sent from heaven on our set. I love that woman. I’d like to find out who did this.""

The two worked together on the 2014 film ""Hercules.""

Since Ferguson's confession, many fans have come up with their own ideas of who was disrespectful to the Swedish actress.

Ferguson has worked alongside some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant in ""Florence Foster Jenkins,"" Emily Blunt in "" The Girl on the Train "" and Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet and Florence Pugh in ""Dune.""

Blunt's spokesperson issued a statement to the Daily Mail, saying there is no bad blood between the actresses.

""Rebecca and Emily are friends, and there’s nothing but love between them,"" a spokesperson for Blunt told the outlet.

Ferguson's confession on the ""Reign"" podcast painted a picture of the incident.

""I did a film with an absolute idiot of a co-star,"" she revealed. ""This human being was being so insecure and angry because [they] couldn’t get the scenes out. And I think I was so vulnerable and uncomfortable that I got screamed at, and I would cry walking off set.""

Careful not to give anything away about the co-star, Ferguson detailed the discomfort she felt.

""This person would literally look at me in front of the whole crew and say, ‘You call yourself an actor? This is what I have to work with? … What is this?’ And I stood there just breaking.

""And I remember the next day I walked on, and I said, ‘You get off my set.’ That's the first time I [had] ever spoken — I remember being so scared. And I looked at this person and I said, ‘You can F off. I’m gonna work toward a tennis ball. I never want to see you again.’""

Ferguson clarified that it was neither A-lister Tom Cruise nor Hugh Jackman, with whom she's worked on several projects.

Continuing with her story, Ferguson said she didn't feel support from executives.

""And then I remember the producers came up and said, ‘You can’t do this to No. 1. We have to let this person be on set,’"" she explained. ""And I said, ‘But the person can turn around, and I can act to the back [of their] head.’ And I did.

""It took so long for me to get to that. It's within my last 10 years or 12 years. And I've acted since I was 16. But, from that moment, I have never let myself get to a point when I've got home and gone, ‘What did, why did that happen?’""

""Wheel of Fortune"" fans were audibly surprised by a moment on Thursday's episode of the popular game show.

Contestant Tara Brown beat the odds twice when she managed to land on the small $1 million wedge at two different points, and both times, she failed to secure the big prize.

Fans of the show, hosted by Pat Sajak and Vanna White, know that the $1 million wedge works differently than the others – when a contestant lands on it and then correctly guesses a letter, they pick it up, and if they solve the final puzzle, then the $1 million prize will be available to win after the bonus round.

‘WHEEL OF FORTUNE’ FANS FRUSTRATED BY MISLEADING PUZZLE: ‘THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO HELL’

The first time Brown obtained the wedge, it was when the contestants had nearly solved a puzzle in the ""Let There Be Light!"" category. There were only two letters left before the puzzle was complete, and it read ""BULB, BEA__N, SUN, STARS.""

Sajak reminded her that she needed to ""call a letter that's in the puzzle, and she hesitantly guessed ""H?""

The audience audibly reacted in dismay, and one person could be heard crying out, ""Oh no!""

She lost out on her chance to get the coveted prize, and another contestant then correctly solved the puzzle by saying ""Bulb, Beacon, Sun, Stars.""

Later on, she managed to get a chance at the wedge once again, but she was unable to .

Viewers in the audience weren't the only ones to have a big reaction to the first flub – fans at home took to X, formerly Twitter, to react to the moment.

‘WHEEL OF FORTUNE’ FANS IRATE AFTER SHOW'S ENDING, BELIEVE CONTESTANT ‘GOT ROBBED’

""Who screens these people?"" one person asked.

""She just blew the chance at $1M with that H guess!!!"" another exclaimed.

One viewer simply asked ""H?""

This reaction is a change of pace for ""Wheel of Fortune"" fans, as many complaints lately have been about the show itself.

In an episode that aired last week, fans began rallying around a contestant, insisting that she had actually named the right answer to the puzzle but that Sajak had failed to recognize it.

The contestant, a woman named Tamara, chose ""What Are You Doing?"" for the category for the final puzzle. After White turned over both the letters the show traditionally provides and the ones Tamara chose, she was left with ""___N_NG A B___ _L_B.""

""Now pay attention to what's up there,"" Sajak advised. ""There's a huge letter board. If you talk it out, you can do this.""

She started out with the word ""fanning,"" but when she couldn't get anywhere with that, she went silent. As her ten seconds were almost up, she came up with ""book club,"" and just before the buzzer rang, she made a guess.

The correct answer was ""JOINING A BOOK CLUB."" Some viewers believe that's what she guessed, but others heard ""running a book club."" In the clip, it sounds like she began to say something else before offering her guess.

""You were right there,"" Sajak told her. ""Got there a little late, unfortunately. By the time you got to ‘book club,’ time was running out on you.""

""Wheel of fortune - the contestant got the puzzle right - you messed it up again!"" one person wrote on X.

Rod Stewart is reinventing himself at age 79 with forays into new musical genres.

The rock legend recently teamed up with Jools Holland and the bandleader's Rhythm & Blues Orchestra to create a new swing album titled ""Swing Fever"" that is racing its way up the Official U.K. Album Charts and on track to claim the number one spot.

""Swing Fever"" will mark Stewart's first number one album in five years, following 2019's ""You’re In My Heart"" and Holland's first-ever release to top the charts. During an interview with The Associated Press, Stewart recalled sharing the vision he had for the album with Holland at the beginning of their collaboration.

""I’m not going to do any slow songs,"" Stewart said. ""I want all upbeat happy [claps his hands], which we need in these grim times that we live in.""

""Swing Fever"" is a 13-track album featuring covers of classic songs from the Big Band era of swing-jazz, including ""Pennies From Heaven,"" ""Almost Like Being in Love,"" ""Lullaby of Broadway,"" ""Aint’ Misbehavin’"" and ""Sentimental Journey.""

Paying homage to the Great American Songbook, a canon of influential American jazz standards, pop songs and showtunes from the early to mid 20th century, was not unfamiliar territory for Stewart.

In 2003, Stewart released ""It Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook,"" the first in a five-part series featuring the singer’s covers of American pop and jazz standards.

However, Stewart wanted to tap into the dancehall energy of the swing era with his latest release.

""They make you tap your feet. They make you smile. Both of us [Holland] were brought up on this music. I did ‘The Great American Songbook,’ so for me this was a natural progression,"" Stewart told the AP.

Prior to collaborating with Holland, Stewart had started recording a swing album in Los Angeles, but he wasn’t pleased with the initial results, noting that the music was ""stale.""

""I’d already started making a swing album, but it didn’t turn out how I wanted it. It was more Frank Sinatra than it was Louis Prima, let’s say…,"" he told the magazine Radio Times, via GBN.

He continued, ""Nothing wrong with Frank at all, he’s the greatest. But the arrangements were very, very polite.""

""I could see while I was there [in the studio] the guys reading the music. And that’s not how I wanted it,"" Stewart added.

""It’s OK to read the music. But it was stale, and it was White, to be quite honest with you. So I said to myself: now, who can I turn to?""

""And the Right Honourable Jools Holland OBE came up. And Jools will take it from there…""

Holland, 66, an original member of the British rock band Squeeze, is also a pianist, composer and vocalist who has collaborated with a number of artists, including Beatles legends Ringo Starr and George Harrison, Bono, Sting and Eric Clapton, among others.

During his interview with the AP, Stewart enthused about working with Holland for the first time.

""I love the whole process of doing live shows,"" Stewart said. ""I love recording. I loved when we put this album together. It was such a joy.""

He continued, ""We didn’t have any arguments or fights or anything like that. It was pure pleasure and I think that comes across when you listen to it. The whole thing was recorded live in Jools’ studio, which is not a big studio. We had 18 people crammed in there, so all the solos were played live.""

The Grammy Award winner told the outlet that not having to write any of the songs for ""Swing Fever"" was another perk.

""I’ve always found songwriting a bit of an agony, really,"" he admitted.

""It’s like going back to school. In fact, when I was in the Faces, they used to lock me in a hotel room with a bottle of wine and say, ‘You’re not coming out till it’s finished.’ Because I was notorious. I wanted to go out and enjoy myself alone.

""I didn’t want to sit in a room and write lyrics and it’s always been a bit of like pulling teeth for me. The joy of this album, obviously, is I didn’t write any of the songs, I had a burning ambition to sing them and I picked the right guy.""

Ahead of ""Swing Fever’s"" release last Friday, Stewart and Holland embarked on a whirlwind tour in support of the album.

In one headline-making moment that emerged from the tour, Stewart stripped off his shirt to reveal the tattoo that he got in honor of his favorite soccer club Celtic F.C.

During an appearance on the Australian talk show ""The Project,"" Stewart mentioned the ""Glascow Celtic"" tattoo that he had inked on his shoulder while in Melbourne.

""I can show it to you if you want but I’ll have to get undressed,"" he told host Sarah Harris.

""Go on, go on! I’ll say yes to that,"" Harris replied.

Stewart then removed his long-sleeved shirt and displayed the tattoo on his shoulder. ""Do you see it?"" he asked with a smile.

""Looks good! You look good,"" Harris said while laughing. ""I got Rod Stewart to take his shirt off.""

""Don’t tell any of your viewers,"" Stewart quipped.

When ""Swing Fever"" claims the number one spot on the U.K. chart, it will mark another milestone for Stewart. The singer will become the 10th on the U.K.’s list of artists with the most career number one albums and the fifth solo artist with that achievement.

In addition to venturing into swing, Stewart confirmed that he also has a country album in the works.

""I plan on doing it. We actually started it. We started making a country album. And I went off and made another solo album, but yeah, it’s in the pipeline,"" he told the AP.

""The record company would like me to do it,"" he added. ""They don’t push me to do it. You know, there will come a time.""

The U.K. native also shared his thoughts on why the country music genre appealed to him.

""Once again. it’s what I grew up with,"" he said. ""You know, not so much country music, but folk music. You know, the likes of Woody Guthrie and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott and Bob Dylan.""

He continued, ""Of course, I loved all that stuff. That’s all. That’s why I learned how to play guitar, because I wanted to sing the songs.""

Stewart’s musical pivot comes after he reportedly sold his interests in his publishing rights and recorded music, as well as some name and likeness rights, to music mogul Irving Azoff's Iconic Artists Group for nearly $100 million earlier this month, according to the Wall Street Journal.

""This year marks my 60th year in the music industry. The time is right, and I feel fortunate to have found partners in Irving and his team at Iconic that I can entrust with my life’s work and future musical legacy,"" Stewart said of the sale in press release.

""We are thrilled to welcome one of the most celebrated singer-songwriters of our time, Rod Stewart, to the Iconic family,"" Chairman and CEO of Iconic Azoff said.

He continued, ""Our new partnership with HPS provides us with the resources and flexibility to make blockbuster signings like this one and to continue the success of our legendary artists and their legacies.""

As the two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee nears his 80th birthday, Stewart has dismissed the possibility that he has plans to retire anytime soon.

""Not really,"" he told the AP of potential retirement plans. ""I suppose, I mean it wouldn’t be for me to judge, but I imagine if people stop buying tickets for concerts and don’t buy records anymore, maybe that’s a sign. I don’t know.""

""The word retirement is not in my vocabulary at the moment because I’m enjoying myself,"" Stewart added.

During an interview with CBS, Stewart was even more emphatic when asked about whether he was slowing down.

""No, I'm not winding down!"" he replied.

When asked if he was instead ""speeding up,"" Stewart said, ""No, I'm not speeding up. I mean, I've got 60-odd concerts this year. It's not time for the pipe and slipper club yet, you know?""

After the interviewer noted, ""Everybody seems to hit a point where they say, 'All right, enough's enough, it's been fun.'""

""No. Not at all,"" Stewart responded. ""It's a drug. It's addictive in a way to get up and sing in front of, you know, 5, 10, 20 thousand people every night, send them all home happy, smiling. It's wonderful. What a job! I don't want to give it up!""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Ozempic is an FDA approved Type 2 diabetes medication that is frequently used for weight loss. Celebrities, including Sharon Osbourne, Oprah Winfrey and Amy Schumer, have admitted to using variations of the drug.

Winslet added more wisdom to the conversation regarding weight and diet, admitting to previously battling a brief eating disorder. She has been candid in the past about being scrutinized for appearance, particularly after starring in ""Titanic"" alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.

""I never told anyone about it,"" she said of developing an eating disorder. ""Because guess what — people in the world around you go: ‘Hey, you look great! You lost weight!’""

""So even the compliment about looking good is connected to weight. And that is one thing I will not let people talk about. If they do, I pull them up straight away.""

In 2021, ""The Regime"" actress told The Guardian, ""In my 20s, people would talk about my weight a lot. And I would be called to comment on my physical self,"" she recalled. ""Well, then I got this label of being ballsy and outspoken. No, I was just defending myself.""

""It was almost laughable how shocking, how critical, how straight-up cruel tabloid journalists were to me,"" Winslet admitted. ""I was still figuring out who the hell I bloody well was! They would comment on my size, they’d estimate what I weighed, they’d print the supposed diet I was on. It was critical and horrible and so upsetting to read.""

In an interview with PORTER last month, Winslet reflected upon the industry, saying it is different from when she was young. She said its expectations have changed, which is great for her daughter, Mia Threapleton , an up-and-coming actress.

""It’s different now. Mia is very much her own person. [Young women now] know how to use their voice,"" she explained. ""I felt like I had to look a certain way, or be a certain thing, and because media intrusion was so significant at that time, my life was quite unpleasant.""

""Journalists would always say, ‘After ""Titanic,"" you could have done anything and yet you chose to do these small things’… and I was like, 'Yeah, you bet your f---in' life I did! Because, guess what, being famous was horrible.'""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Both the singer and Linn have been in serious relationships in the past, with McEntire having been married twice and Linn having been engaged four times.

After dinner, McEntire and Linn went to a wine bar, where she excitedly revealed her love of tater tots. Upon hearing that, McEntire recalled Linn telling her, ""I’m famous for giving people their nicknames, and that's your nickname.""

""Later on during the pandemic, I was in Oklahoma with my sister Susie, and she said, ‘You know he gave you Tater Tot, let’s give him Sugar Tot,'"" she said. ""So we're the tots. Sugar and Tater. How about that? Is that not cute?""

The two also bonded over their mutual love of the Western lifestyle, explaining they both wanted careers in the rodeo, but since they didn't have a lot of talent for it, she went into music, and he became an actor.

McEntire and Linn first met in 1991 when they both starred in the movie ""The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw"" with Kenny Rogers. They were both in relationships at the time but were both available when they reconnected on the set of ""Young Sheldon.""

""It's good to have a person to talk to, laugh with, get into subjects about what's going on,"" she said on an episode of her podcast, ""Living & Learning,"" in October 2020. ""Discussions about our past, our family, funny stories, him being an actor, me being an actress. And he's very into my music. I'm very into his career.""

Due to the pandemic, the beginning of their relationship was long-distance, with Linn living in Los Angeles and McEntire living in Oklahoma and Nashville. The ""Fancy"" singer told People in October 2023, after meeting in January 2020, that they didn't see each other again in person until June of that year.

""So it was telephones, Zooms, texting, so we got to really know each other before it was any physical contact,"" she explained.

The two would go on to star together in ""Big Sky,"" playing husband and wife in the show's third season. ""Every scene was fun for me, because I was working with her,"" Linn told Country Now in January 2023, adding the two of them would ""wink at each other in the middle of a scene.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Donna D'Errico won't back down from internet trolls.

The ""Baywatch"" beauty was recently targeted by a group of ""hater women"" online who reported harmless bikini photos to Instagram.

D'Errico, a top OnlyFans model, refused to allow the abuse, and despite a few photos being pulled from her account after they were reported, she reposted the snaps for her nearly 3 million Instagram followers and faced being shadowbanned by the platform.

""I can't allow that to happen,"" Donna exclusively told Fox News Digital. ""I want them to see that I won't be bullied.""

‘BAYWATCH’ STAR DONNA D'ERRICO REVEALS TOP ONLYFANS REQUEST: ULTIMATE ‘GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE’

D'Errico admitted her plight against online critics is ""an ongoing battle."" She regularly posts fun and flirty bikini pics and videos on her profile but was flagged numerous times for violating community guidelines.

Before she knew it, content had been removed from her page, including a behind-the-scenes video from a photo shoot where Donna posed in a hallway wearing a tight black dress with cutouts across her waist and bright red heels.

She reposted the video with a lengthy caption.

""It's not nice to go on peoples accounts reporting perfectly fine photos and videos to cause their account to get flagged and posts to get removed,"" she wrote. ""Feeling bad about yourself doesn't make it okay to try to bring down someone else to make you feel better about yourself. I'm putting this right back up. Nothing wrong with this video. Some people hate seeing others shine. Sending out positive vibes to you all, even the ones who did that.""

‘BAYWATCH’ STAR DONNA D'ERRICO ON ONLYFANS AND FAITH: ‘I’M NOT DOING PORN'

Donna then shared on her Instagram stories, ""I'm shadow banned again because a group of hater women report everything I post. Fully clothed photos and videos I'm forced to remove when IG is filled with full on nudity.

""The bullying and hate and jealousy on here is out of control. That's why I like the site I'm on in my bio. No hate, no bullying, no jealousy. This is so dumb!""

Meta is investigating the removed content, Fox News Digital confirmed.

When asked why she believed her images were flagged, D'Errico chalked up the bad behavior to people who feel like they ""need to tear others down"" to ""feel better about themselves.""

""I know that a lot of people are like that, especially on social media, because they can sort of hide behind their account and be anonymous,"" she said. ""Then they sit back and watch the fallout of what they've done, and it pleases them because they see someone else being taken down that maybe they have some jealousy of. I don't really know exactly.""

D'Errico noticed that women are more often critical of her content, something she's struggled with for years as she's propelled her image online.

""I'm constantly blocking and deleting really, really cruel and mean comments that only women seem to make,"" Donna said. ""Honestly, I have to laugh about it because the alternative is being offended or hurt or feeling bad about myself … and I don't allow that.""

D’Errico, who starred as lifeguard Donna Marco on ""Baywatch,"" admitted she would be ""wounded for a week when someone said something evil"" to her.

""My self-confidence would plummet. In the entertainment industry, you've got to have confidence or at least be able to be confident,"" D'Errico said. ""That's very hard to do when you're internalizing things that are being said to you that are ugly.""

By reposting the photos users deemed unacceptable, D'Errico believes she's fighting back against her haters and taking control of her own image.

""I won't allow them to do that to me. I won't stand for it, and I'm not going to be suppressed,"" she emphasized, ""Standing in your power isn't standing in your ego.""

D'Errico has been more confident than ever thanks to the success of her OnlyFans page, where she shares content with adult subscribers.

She credited OnlyFans as ""one of the best things I've done"" in a previous interview with Fox News Digital. D’Errico said engaging with her fans on the site makes her feel ""feminine and beautiful and sexy. The money is another aspect that, it's just way more than I anticipated that it would be.

""Where else could I get this kind of, you know, this kind of non-judgmental, non-bullying, having fun, feeling sexy, feeling pretty, being told that I'm pretty, being told you look so great all the time. … It's like a dream. Why would I not do it? I wish I'd done it years ago, honestly.""

When she initially joined the site more than a year ago, D’Errico received numerous requests for feet photos.

""I don't really get that anymore. Now, they mostly want to see me, like in everyday life, just the real me and everyday life,"" the former Playboy Playmate said. ""Maybe wearing a T-shirt, making coffee or, you know, just that kind of thing. That's the biggest request.

""I'm like, 'Well, I don't have any makeup on and my hair is in a ponytail, and I'm kind of in sweats,'"" she said. ""'I don't care. I want to see that.' So, they like that because I think it gives them kind of that what I call ‘the girlfriend experience.’ It may be.

""I think I call it the girlfriend experience because I think they get the same thing out of it that I do. They get to log in and have fun kind of having an experience that they would have if they had a girlfriend. But then they log off, and then they're gone. There's nobody to check in with.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The show, running through much of the ‘80s into the early ’90s, is introduced to new fans to this day, with it living on various streaming services.

The main setting of ""Cheers,"" and the only setting for the entirety of season one, is a Boston bar owned by Sam Malone, a former Red Sox pitcher, played by Ted Danson.

HOW HOUSEHOLD TV SHOWS LIKE ‘MODERN FAMILY’ AND ‘FULL HOUSE’ COMPARE TO ‘THE BRADY BUNCH’

This bar ends up forming a group of unlikely companions, between those who work there, and locals that frequently visit.

Diane Chambers, played by Shelley Long, was one of the main characters on the show until her departure in the fifth season. Diane becomes employed at the bar after her fiancé leaves her for his ex in the first episode. Diane has a playful, on-again, off-again relationship with Sam on the show.

Coach Ernie Pantusso, played by Nicholas Colasanto, the retired baseball coach turned bartender, is another member of the main cast. Colasanto died in 1985. A new character played by Woody Harrelson took the character's place beginning in the fourth season of the show.

Norm Peterson, Cliff Clavin and Dr. Frasier Crane are among the regulars at Cheers. Also, part of the main cast is Rhea Perlman, who plays Carla Tortelli, a single mother and easily angered waitress at the bar.

Lilith Sternin, played by Bebe Neuwirth, and Rebecca Howe, played by Kirstie Alley, also become members of the bar crew later in the series.

‘FRIENDS’, ‘SEINFELD’ AND OTHER TV SHOWS UNFIT FOR TODAY'S WOKE CULTURE

If you loved the main setting and themes of ""Cheers,"" here are five other shows you can watch next.

""Frasier"" is an obvious transition from ""Cheers,"" as it continues with the same story.

""Frasier"" is a spinoff of ""Cheers,"" centered on the character it is named after.

In this series, Frasier, played Kelsey Grammer, moves from Boston back to his hometown of Seattle following his divorce.

Throughout the show, many of the main ""Cheers"" cast members make appearances.

This show had an impressive run of its own, continuing for 11 seasons. The show began right after ""Cheers"" concluded. In 2023, a ""Frasier"" reboot was kickstarted once again.

IF YOU LOVED ‘THE GOLDEN GIRLS,’ TUNE INTO MODERN VERSIONS OF THE SHOW LIKE ‘GIRLS’ AND ‘YOUNGER’

If you loved ""Cheers,"" ""Seinfeld"" is another sitcom you will likely enjoy.

The '90s sitcom has a very similar humor to that of ""Cheers."" In this show, Jerry Seinfeld, played by himself, and George Costanza, played by Jason Alexander, are the two characters of the friend group whose relationship dates many years, similar to Coach and Sam in ""Cheers."" Seinfeld and Costanza became good friends in high school, and remained close into adulthood.

Cosmo Kramer meets Seinfeld after the comedian moves in across the hall. Elaine Benes, played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, is the ex-girlfriend turned platonic friend of Seinfeld's.

This show follows a group of friends, who usually convene at a local diner or in Seinfeld's New York City apartment, as they navigate things like work and dating through comedic moments from the quirky characters.

""Friends"" has many similarities to ""Cheers,"" making the series a clear choice to binge-watch.

""Friends"" ran around the same time as ""Frasier,"" and starts in a very similar manner as ""Cheers.""

In ""Cheers,"" Diane is the one in need of a job after being dumped by her fiancé. In ""Friends,"" Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, stumbles into a coffee shop called Central Perk, where she runs into old high school friend Monica Geller, played by Courteney Cox. Also at the local spot are the rest of the friends; Monica's brother Ross, played by David Schwimmer, Phoebe Buffay played by Lisa Kudrow, Joey Tribbiani played by Matt LeBlanc, and Chandler Bing, played by the late Matthew Perry.

Rachel is wearing her wedding dress, as she has just left her husband-to-be, Barry Farber, behind.

Rachel ends up taking on a job at the local coffee shop where the friends often spend their time, similar to Diane in ""Cheers.""

The frequent setting of Central Perk, which actually used to be a bar, is very similar to the common meeting place in ""Cheers.""

The love triangles and relationships between friends, as well as the situations they encounter navigating their lives in their 20s and 30s, are very similar to ""Cheers.""

""Cheers"" even appears in ""Friends"" during the episode titled ""The One with Ross's Wedding"" in season four, when Joey flips on the show while in London. The theme song of the show begins to play, and when the character hears the chorus ""where everybody knows your name,"" he is hit with a feeling of homesickness.

""The Office"" is a documentary-style show about the daily events at Dunder Mifflin Paper Co.

This show is similar to ""Cheers"" in terms of workplace settings. In ""The Office,"" co-workers develop friendships with all the situations they encounter together. Many ""Cheers"" scenes take place at the local bar, just as ""The Office"" scenes are heavily filmed at Dunder Mifflin.

Novak as Ryan Howard, Mindy Kaling as Kelly Kapoor, Ed Helms as Andy Bernard, Paul Lieberstein as Toby Flenderson and Craig Robinson as Darryl Philbin.

The friends in ""How I Met Your Mother"" frequent a local bar called MacLaren's Pub, similar to the hangout spot of ""Cheers.""

This sitcom ran from 2005 until 2014. In this show, Josh Radnor plays Ted Mosby and tells his two children of the moments he and his group of friends shared on his quest for love, leading up to meeting their mother.

Bethany Joy Lenz is sharing more details about the years she spent in a cult.

The actress announced on Instagram that her memoir, ""Dinner for Vampires,"" will include memories from her time ""spent in an abusive, high-demand group (aka, cult).""

""Being a writer has been a great, private joy in my life since I was about 12,"" she wrote in her Instagram caption. ""This isn’t the first book I thought I’d write, publicly, but as difficult as this subject matter is to untangle, I’m grateful I get to share my story, my way.""

""It’s a story of forgiveness and a roadmap to how manipulation works, with heartache and humor along the way,"" she continued. ""We all make mistakes and I hope Dinner for Vampires reminds you that, no matter what weird roads you’ve gone down, you’re not alone.""

BETHANY JOY LENZ OF 'ONE TREE HILL' SAYS SHE SPENT 10 YEARS IN A CULT: 'THERE'S A LOT TO TELL'

The description of the book details Lenz's journey as a young actress who grew up as an only child and ""always wanted a place to belong."" As she got older, she would find ""the safe haven she’d been searching for in a Bible study group"" composed of others in the industry.

While Lenz initially found happiness in the group, the description explains it ""soon morphed into something more sinister,"" through ""a slowly woven web of manipulation, abuse, and fear under the guise of a church covenant"" known as The Big House Family.

Eventually, Lenz found herself losing all sense of ""autonomy,"" when she moved into ""the Family’s Pacific Northwest compound,"" which was run by the ""domineering"" cult leader. The leader not only convinced her ""to marry one of his sons,"" but also ""steadily drained millions of her TV income without her knowledge.""

""Family ‘minders’ assigned to her on set, ""Maoist struggle session""–inspired meetings in the basement of a filthy house, and regular counseling with ‘Leadership’ were just part of the tactics used to keep her loyal,"" the description read.

Lenz starred on the hit WB teen drama ""One Tree Hill"" for nine seasons, from 2003 to 2012, having been in the cult the whole time. She played Haley James Scott on the show, the best friend of Chad Michael Murray's character, Lucas Scott, and wife of his half-brother and former nemesis, Nathan Scott.

Lenz previously opened up about the support she felt from her cast members on the show, telling the ""Biscuits & Jam"" podcast in November, when she made the decision to leave the cult, she felt ""there were many open arms"" waiting to comfort her, and that she found that ""very helpful.""

""I feel like a lot of the people there, whether consciously or subconsciously, knew that just their presence and being an encouragement and letting me know that they still loved and cared about me in spite of the fact that I was a little weird, that made a big difference. It made me feel like there was a safety,"" she said.

In an interview published Thursday on People, Lenz explained the hardest part about writing ""Dinner for Vampires"" was having to relive the experiences, saying ""exploring the memories, and really facing them,"" was really ""challenging"" for her, but she persevered.

Since leaving the group, Lenz shared she has gone through ""lots of therapy"" to overcome what she referred to as ""spiritual abuse.""

""Recovery looks different for everyone, depending on your experience of trauma,"" she explained. ""I had to start from a baseline of my personal understanding of God and the experiences I had had.

The Princess of Wales is listed to review the Trooping the Colour ceremony, an event at Horse Guards Parade to honor King Charles' birthday, according to the British Army's official website. This would mark her first official appearance since undergoing surgery in January.

More than 1,400 British Army soldiers are expected to take part in the review, which is nearly identical to the event scheduled the following weekend for His Majesty.

KATE MIDDLETON'S ‘CLOAK-AND-DAGGER’ BEHAVIOR SURROUNDING HOSPITALIZATION IS FUELING RUMORS: ROYAL EXPERT

The British Army featured an image of the Princess of Wales from a St. Patrick's Day event in 2023 on its website as she inspected the Irish guards while wearing a green suit with a matching fascinator.

The palace did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

KATE MIDDLETON SPOTTED FOR FIRST TIME SINCE JANUARY HOSPITALIZATION

Middleton has largely remained out of the public eye since December, and is recovering from abdominal surgery in January.

On Monday, the Princess of Wales was spotted in the passenger seat of a vehicle driven by her mother, Carole, outside of Windsor Castle.

Middleton's sighting marked the first time Kate has been seen in public in 70 days. Her last public appearance was at a church service with her family on Christmas.

Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that Middleton was hospitalized for a planned abdominal surgery and would not be able to resume public duties until after Easter.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace , which handles the household for the Prince and Princess of Wales, told Fox News Digital, ""Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the Princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates. The guidance in January stands that the Princess would be recuperating at home in Windsor.""

The spokesperson reiterated the princess is ""doing well.""

In January, the palace announced, ""Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales was admitted to The London Clinic yesterday for planned abdominal surgery.

""The surgery was successful and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for ten to fourteen days, before returning home to continue her recovery.""

The London Clinic had another royal patient in January, with King Charles III receiving medical attention for a ""corrective procedure"" for an enlarged prostate . The palace later announced his surgery had been a success.

""His Majesty is doing quite well,"" a royal source told Fox News Digital. Two weeks later, Charles, who ascended the throne following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II , revealed a cancer diagnosis.

""Yellowstone"" star Kelsey Asbille admitted she stuffed her bra when auditioning for ""One Tree Hill"" at the age of 13.

Asbille, now 32, recalled being cast as Gigi Silveri in the 2000s American drama series during an appearance on the podcast ""Drama Queens,"" hosted by her ""One Tree Hill"" co-stars, Sophia Bush, Hilarie Burton and Bethany Joy Lenz.

""I was 13, and y’all were like these beautiful [women],"" Asbille remembered. ""I stuffed my bra for the audition. Oh my god, I had to! I remember, I thought I was auditioning for a cheerleader, so I borrowed my friend’s cheerleading outfit, and they were like, ‘No, no, no, this is the school nerd.'""

The actress landed the part of Gigi, who was a high school student crushing on Lee Norris' character, Marvin ""Mouth"" McFadden.

""I didn’t know at all what I was doing. I was just so happy to be there. I couldn’t believe my luck. I do remember getting the note to stop smiling,"" Asbille confessed.

‘ONE TREE HILL’ STAR BETHANY JOY LENZ SUFFERED ALLEGED ‘SPIRITUAL ABUSE’ DURING YEARS IN A CULT

The ""Fargo"" actress was so young, her first kiss ended up being one shot on camera with actor James Lafferty when she was 14. He starred as Nathan Scott in the series — one of the lead roles.

""This is terrible,"" she recalled. ""So my first kiss was on ‘One Tree Hill,’ was with James [Lafferty].""

""I remember I was so incredibly nervous, like, kissing my hand, not eating a shrimp skewer that day … I remember asking Sophia [Bush], ‘Do you kiss during rehearsal?'""

Asbille had been a fan of the show before being cast and was a fan of Lafferty's.

""I was completely a Nathan girl,"" she said. ""I had such a crush on James too. He was so nice. It was cruel, the whole kiss thing.""

""We don’t wanna get what we wish for,"" she added.

While most actors age faster in real life than their fictional on-screen characters, ""One Tree Hill"" actually aged the characters at one point after jumping ahead four years. This made Asbille even younger than her character Gigi, who was now in her mid-20s, while the actress was actually 17.

""I also remember y’all being so wonderful, and protective as well, especially when we were shifting gears [in later seasons, and] she was getting more sexy,"" Asbille recalled to her co-stars. ""[I was] having to take my shirt off, and I remember being really nervous about all of that and not knowing what I was supposed to do.""

In season six of ""One Tree Hill,"" Asbille's character attempts to seduce her ex-boyfriend into getting back together with her.

""I remember Sophia specifically being really protective, of like, ‘Alright, so we’re wearing a tube top,’ which I really appreciate because it’s scary navigating all of this, and you don’t know that you can say no,"" she explained.

Asbille was joined on ""One Tree Hill"" by James Lafferty, Hilarie Burton, Bethany Joy Lenz, Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray.

The CW show ran for nine seasons, from 2003 until 2012.

If they had tied the knot, longtime loves Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn might not be together.

The two celebrated 41 years together this past Valentine's Day, and now Hawn is speaking about why their relationship works without legal unification.

""People fuse, and fusion is very bad,"" she told Dax Shepard on his podcast, ""Armchair Expert,"" while discussing the pitfalls of marriage.

""Because once you start losing yourself, engaged in someone else's everything, become too dependent…then there's a loss of respect, there's expectation, and then a lot of people actually shift mentally when they feel tied up,"" Hawn said.

KURT RUSSELL, GOLDIE HAWN KISS DURING ROMANTIC ASPEN GETAWAY AFTER 40 YEARS TOGETHER

""I always said if I'm in a cage, and I'm a bird, and you leave the door open, I'll probably never fly out,"" Hawn explained. ""If you close the door to the cage, my feathers will be gone, and I won't look like a bird anymore. And I wouldn't survive.""

Hawn has two children, Oliver and Kate, from her previous marriage to Bill Hudson. Russell has a son, Boston, from his marriage to Season Hubley. Shepard suggested the couple, who share one biological son together, Wyatt, might not be together if they got married.

""Probably not,"" Hawn admitted. ""Ultimately, when you look back on it, I've never asked that question of myself, because what I like is waking up in the morning, and I've said this many times, and actually making a choice to be with someone.""

""I picked him,"" she said of Russell. ""I like that guy.""

""We don't agree on certain things. He was tougher than me as a parent. … But we have a very, very strong family because of it. That was one of the things that gave us things to talk about,"" she said of why their relationship stuck.

""But I think that if we were married, there probably could have been times, when you go, ‘Oh c’mon. I'm done.'""

The ""Shampoo"" actress says to this day, she still meets men, none of whom measure up to Russell.

""I'm really happy I stayed,"" she noted.

Elle Macpherson has brought her talents back to the catwalk.

The Australian supermodel, 59, appeared on the runway for the first time in 14 years on Monday. Macpherson was part of the Triumphant x PayPal Runway show during the 2024 Melbourne Fashion Festival on Monday.

During the show, Elle wore several different Bianca Spender looks.

One of the looks was a bright yellow trench coat paired with matching pants as she held a clutch on the runway.

Macpherson also wore a brown wool dress over a brown pair of silk pants. Another wool dress was tied around her shoulders as her look was paired with a long, brown coat and a brown purse.

Elle debuted a third look, which was an all-black outfit with a sheer, deep-plunging neckline.

The supermodel had a smile on her face throughout the show. After the show, Macpherson took to Instagram to show gratitude for being included in the production.

""Grateful to be asked to walk @paypalau for @melbfashionfestival - so good to be back home supporting Australian designers - Thankyou @paypalau,"" Elle captioned her images.

Included in Macpherson's carousel of images were behind-the-scenes shots from the show, an up-close image of a pair of flats with her name written inside and a shot of some of the designs hanging on a clothing rack.

Elle rose to fame in the ‘80s after appearing in Sports Illustrated magazines. In 1989, Time magazine coined her with the nickname, ""The Body."" Prior to Monday’s show, Macpherson last walked the runway in 2010 when she closed the show at Louis Vuitton show at Paris Fashion Week.

Elle's return to the spotlight came shortly after she opened up about her ideal daily routine — which includes no caffeine and sleeping with no clothes.

During a conversation with Amanda Wakeley while on the ""Amanda Wakeley: StyleDNA"" podcast, Macpherson shared her bedtime musts.

""I go to bed with a smile. I go to bed with a happy heart. And an eye mask, and no clothes. [Just] my skin,"" she explained on Feb. 21.

In addition to revealing her nighttime routine, the supermodel discussed how she maintains her youthful appearance. She told the podcast host, your outer beauty is a reflection of your inner health, explaining that ""topical beauty only goes so far.""

She went on to say, to stay healthy it is important to ""feed…[the] mitochondria of yourselves,"" which she referred to as ""your heartbeat."" A few of the ways she achieves this are limiting her caffeine intake and not eating too close to bedtime, saying, ""I weaned myself off of coffee and I eat earlier in the day, so I eat at 5:00.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Kevin Costner spent decades bringing ""Horizon: An American Saga"" to life.

He revealed the first trailer for the four-part, post-Civil War drama last week, which featured a new Costner to fall in love with on the silver screen: his 15-year-old son, Hayes Logan Costner.

In another clip shared on social media Sunday, Kevin praised his youngest son for being ""the best part of the Horizon: Part 1 trailer.""

‘HORIZON’ DIRECTOR KEVIN COSTNER GRATEFUL ‘GOD ALLOWED’ HIM TO MAKE EPIC MOVIE DESPITE MASSIVE PERSONAL RISKS

""When it’s your movie you get to pick who you hang out with,"" Costner wrote. ""Really proud of my son, Hayes, for making his acting debut in #HorizonAmericanSaga.""

Costner added, ""And thanks to all of you for the love you’ve shown our trailer this week. I couldn’t be more excited to share this with you.""

KEVIN COSTNER INVESTS IN UTAH FOR NEXT CAREER MOVE

In addition to starring in the feature film, Costner also directed ""Horizon"" based on a script he co-wrote with John Baird.

Costner rode off into the sunset from ""Yellowstone"" and into the American Southwest in the first teaser trailer released last week for ""Horizon,"" which was filmed in Utah and made by Territory Pictures (his production company), in association with Warner Bros.

When asked during a Zoom panel if ""Horizon"" was more difficult to make than ""Dances with Wolves,"" Costner revealed that his 30-year epic took the cake.

""This is by far the biggest struggle,"" Costner said, via Variety. ""I’m shocked at what we were able to get. I shot ‘Dances’ for 106 days, I shot the movie you’re just seeing right now in 52.""

He added, ""I did learn a lot and I was able to use every trick in the book to try to bring this movie to ground and to bring it to an audience. And there’s four of them!""

""Horizon"" marks the fourth time Costner's sat in the director's chair. His last directorial effort was more than 20 years ago with ""Open Range,"" followed by the 1997 film ""The Postman."" He earned multiple Academy Awards for ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990.

Costner shared gratitude to God for allowing him to even make the first two films. ""I’m terribly satisfied in my own life that God allowed me to get these first two done,"" Costner said. ""I mean, if I’m hit by lightning, who knows what happens? At least I went West.""

While the premise of ""Horizon"" wasn't explained in the three-minute trailer, Costner highlights the beauty of the American Southwest before zeroing in on the ensemble cast, which includes Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Giovanni Ribisi, Jena Malone and Abbey Lee.

Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jeff Fahey, Will Patton, Tatanka Means, Owen Crow Shoe and Ella Hunt round out the star-studded roster.

""Blue Bloods"" paid tribute to Treat Williams Friday in a farewell episode to his character, Lenny Ross.

Ross, the former partner of New York City Police Commissioner Francis ""Frank"" Reagan (played by Tom Selleck), was last featured in season 13 when it was revealed his character had cancer. On Friday's show, Lenny succumbed to the disease.

Williams died in June following a vehicular accident in Dorset, Vermont, according to police. He was 71.

On Friday's episode, Frank grappled with the decision of having to make Lenny's daughter Tess face prosecution after she's arrested following a bar fight, according to Deadline.

""He was my best friend. And I’m gonna honor that by doing what’s best for his daughter,"" Frank said. He later opted to refer Tess to a good defense attorney.

In a final scene over a family meal, Frank paid tribute to his former partner.

DRIVER INVOLVED IN TREAT WILLIAMS' FATAL ACCIDENT PLEADS NOT GUILTY, FACES 15 YEARS IN PRISON

""Lenny Ross was my oldest friend, my closest confidant, my getaway driver,"" Frank said, according to the outlet. ""And I lost him this week. And it hurts like hell. But Lenny would hate it if we got all teary and quiet and sad, so Lenny: We’ll miss ya. And save me a seat at your table, and I’ll see ya on down the road.""

The episode ended with a photo of Treat with his arm around Tom, and the message, ""In memory of our great friend, Treat Williams 1951-2023.""

The Vermont State Police confirmed Williams' death in a statement last year, saying Williams was driving along Morse Hill Road at approximately 4:53 p.m. when his motorcycle was unable to avoid a Honda SUV and the two vehicles collided.

""The Vermont State Police is investigating a crash between an SUV and a motorcycle Monday afternoon, June 12, 2023, in Dorset in which the operator of the motorcycle suffered fatal injuries,"" the statement read. ""The motorcyclist is identified as Richard Treat Williams, 71, of Manchester Center, Vermont.""

The crash happened on Vermont Route 30 just north of Morse Hill Road when a southbound 2008 Honda Element attempted to turn into a parking lot.

Authorities added, ""Initial investigation indicates the Element stopped, signaled a left turn, and then turned into the path of a northbound 1986 Honda VT700c motorcycle operated by Williams,"" the statement read.

Williams was unable to avoid the oncoming vehicle and was thrown from his motorcycle, suffering critical injuries. He was then airlifted to Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, where he was pronounced dead.

Ryan Koss, 35, was charged with grossly negligent operation resulting in death, and could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

Williams' lengthy film and television career began in 1975 with his movie debut in ""Deadly Hero.""

His nearly 50-year acting career included starring roles on the TV series ""Everwood"" and in the movie ""Hair."" He appeared in more than 120 TV and film roles, including the features ""The Eagle Has Landed,"" ""Prince of the City"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America.""

The British royal is in Wales for St. David’s Day, the feast day of the country’s patron saint. The Prince of Wales was in Wrexham at The Turf Pub, which is located next to the Wrexham Association Football Club’s stadium, Racecourse Ground.

The Wrexham soccer team was recently the subject of the docuseries, ""Welcome to Wrexham."" It explores the redevelopment of the historic soccer club after it was purchased by Ryan Reynolds and ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" star, Rob McElhenney in 2021.

PRINCE WILLIAM BACKS OUT OF ATTENDING MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR GREEK KING DUE TO PERSONAL MATTER

While Reynolds is editing ""Deadpool,"" McElhenney is in town to welcome the father of three. Royal sources told People magazine on Friday that there are hopes for William and the actor to catch up later this year.

The heir to the British throne was photographed getting behind the bar, making a toast and taking a shot with McElhenney, 46. He also met with the staff and community members, as well as representatives of various local charities.

Outside the pub, William greeted a young Florence Boyle by giving her a high-five. The child gave the prince a daffodil, which is a tradition to wear on the feast day.

William then headed over to the soccer stadium, where he was gifted a Wrexham jersey with his name and the number 9 on the back. People magazine noted that William is the president of the Football Association, the game’s governing body in England. He is known to attend Aston Villa games to support his favorite team. William also met with stadium staff and players.

William’s appearance came as Buckingham Palace grapples with conspiracy theories around Kate Middleton’s so-called ""disappearance.""

Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that the Princess of Wales would remain at a London hospital for up to two weeks after undergoing planned abdominal surgery. The 42-year-old has been recuperating at the family’s Adelaide Cottage in Windsor.

As the princess continues to recover, a flurry of conspiracy theories has emerged on sites like X and TikTok, with users speculating about the royal’s whereabouts and health condition.

A spokesperson for Kensington Palace, which handles the household for the Prince and Princess of Wales, told Fox News Digital on Thursday, ""Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the Princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates. The guidance in January stands that the Princess would be recuperating at home in Windsor.""

The spokesperson reiterated the princess is ""doing well.""

It is unclear why the princess needed abdominal surgery. While it is somewhat unusual for members of the royal family to release details about their health, the initial announcement was likely made to avoid speculation about whether events featuring the princess had to be postponed or canceled over the coming weeks.

The palace noted the royal ""is making good progress.""

However, that has not stopped the rumors.

Following Middleton’s surgery, journalist Concha Calleja alleged on the popular Spanish news program ""Fiesta"" that the princess was in a coma due to health complications, the U.K. Sunday Times reported.

""The doctors had to make drastic decisions at that moment because of the complications that arose,"" Calleja said, as reported by the outlet. ""The decision was to put her in an induced coma. They had to intubate her. There were serious complications that they didn’t expect because the operation went well, but the postoperative period didn’t go so well.""

The outlet noted that Calleja alleged that Middleton was at one point in ""great danger"" and ""practically an entire hospital"" was set up at her home. Other Spanish outlets reported Calleja's claims.

Soon after, a palace source vehemently denied the report, calling it ""total nonsense.""

""No attempt was made by that journalist to fact-check anything that she said with anyone in the household,"" the source told the outlet. ""It’s fundamentally, totally made-up, and I’ll use polite English here: It’s absolutely not the case.""

A spokesperson for Kensington Palace and Calleja did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

The U.K. and foreign media have been focused on the health of Britain’s senior royals in recent years, first as the late Queen Elizabeth II faded from public view during the last months of her 70-year reign, then when King Charles III ascended the throne at an age when most of his contemporaries were long retired.

Kinsey Schofield, host of the ""To Di For Daily"" podcast, previously claimed to Fox News Digital that Middleton’s recuperation has been going smoothly.

""I have heard that the Princess of Wales has been responding to emails, but everything has been structured so that she is not overwhelmed or disturbed by incoming dialogue,"" said Schofield.

Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, is done with people misunderstanding the actor’s dementia diagnosis.

On Sunday, she took to Instagram and shared a video exploring her frustration with ""clickbaity"" headlines.

""It’s Sunday morning and I’m triggered. I just got clickbaited. I’m just scrolling minding my own business and just saw a headline and got clickbaited that had to do with my own family,"" she began.

""The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband,"" she continued.

BRUCE WILLIS’ WIFE SAYS HER LOVE FOR ACTOR ‘ONLY GROWS’ BUT ADMITS ‘HOLIDAYS ARE HARD’ AMID DEMENTIA BATTLE

""Now, I can just tell you that is far from the truth. I need society and whoever’s writing these stupid headlines to stop scaring people. Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that that’s it, it’s over. Let’s pack it up, nothing else to see here. We’re done.""

As Heming Willis put it, ""No. It is the complete opposite of that, okay? 100%. There is grief and sadness, there’s all of that. But you start a new chapter. And that chapter is filled. Let me just tell you what it is, it’s filled with love, it’s filled with connection. It’s filled with joy, it’s filled with happiness. That’s where we are.""

Heming Willis has been married to the ""Die Hard"" star since 2009, and the couple share two daughters. She is also step-mom to Willis’ daughters, Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah, with ex-wife, Demi Moore.

In March 2022, Willis stepped away from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia that progressed to frontotemporal dementia.

In the caption of her post, Heming Willis continued calling out people for spreading misinformation about dementia and other neurological issues.

""Here’s what I’ve come to understand is that we are being educated by the wrong people. People that have an opinion versus an experience. People that have not taken the time to properly educate themselves on any kind of neurocognitive disease. Why can I be so bold and say that? Because I see headline after headline and blurbs of misinformation,"" she wrote in part.

""I’m not even talking about my family, I’m used to the craziness of these farfetched headlines and stories. I’m just talking about baseline dementia awareness and what’s being fed to the public,"" she continued. ""You wonder why anxiety and depression is up in our society. I honestly think part of it has to do with this kind of clickbait, how things are framed and pushed out to us and how we have a split second to take that information in. Man, it’ll do a number on my psyche.""

The 45-year-old concluded her post, ""To whom it may concern, please be mindful how you frame your story’s to the public about dementia and dig deeper. There are so many wonderful organizations and specialist within this space to reach out to so you can really do your due diligence to iron your story and content out. Thank you.""

Earlier this year, Heming Willis announced she will be releasing a book in 2025 about her experiences as a caregiver to her husband and offer advice and interviews.

""For me, knowledge is power, and building a supportive community around me has been vital,"" Heming Willis previously said in a statement. ""It has brought stability and a certain amount of control back, control that was completely shattered when the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia first came into our family’s world.""

She continued, ""Identifying the right resources to educate and enlighten myself has been powerful and has allowed me the space to continue to move forward in the most positive way so that I can be the best mother, wife, daughter, friend and care partner.

Henley also addressed an arrest that occurred in 1980 after authorities found drugs and a 16-year-old sex worker at his Los Angeles home.

He testified he had called for the sex worker because he ""wanted to escape the depression I was in"" over The Eagles break up.

""I wanted to forget about everything that was happening with the band, and I made a poor decision which I regret to this day. I’ve had to live with it for 44 years. I’m still living with it today, in this courtroom. Poor decision,"" the 76-year-old told the court, according to The Associated Press.

Henley said, as he has in the past, he didn’t know the girl’s age until after the arrest and did do cocaine with her, but did not engage in sex.

""I don’t remember the anatomical details, but I know there was no sex,"" he said.

The girl suffered an overdose, and Henley called firefighters, who checked her condition and found her to be OK. Then they left with the singer promising to take care of her.

According to Henley, as she was preparing to leave with someone she’d had him call, police arrived and found cocaine, quaaludes and marijuana.

In 1981, Henley pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was sentenced to probation and a $2,500 fine, and he requested a drug education program to get some possession charges dismissed.

The incident came up as Henley was on the stand to detail his version of how handwritten pages from The Eagles development of their 1976 album ""Hotel California"" made their way from his Southern California barn to New York auctions decades later.

Henley’s arrest was brought up by prosecutors, apparently before the defense could highlight it.

Representatives for Henley told Fox News Digital he was unavailable for comment at this time.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 7, 1977, THE SONG 'HOTEL CALIFORNIA' BY THE EAGLES HITS NO. 1

The ""Boys of Summer"" singer testified against Glenn Horowitz, Craig Inciardi and Edward Kosinski, who were charged with conspiracy in the fourth degree for allegedly attempting to sell manuscripts that included ""developmental lyrics to the Eagles song 'Hotel California,'"" according to the original indictment filed by the New York District Attorney's office in 2022.

The manuscripts are collectively valued at over $1 million, according to the district attorney.

According to the indictment, the defendants acquired the pages through Ed Sanders, a nonfiction writer who was working on a biography of the band that was never published. Sanders reportedly kept the handwritten work and later sold the pages to Horowitz, a rare-book dealer, for $50,000.

Per the AP, Sanders said Henley's assistant had sent him the documents for the biography project in a 2005 email to Horowitz.

Horowitz then sold pages to Inciardi, a former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator, and memorabilia collector Kosinski. Inciardi and Kosinski attempted to sell pages of the lyrics through Kosinski's company, Gotta Have Rock and Roll, but were caught by Henley in 2012.

Henley then purchased the ""original handwritten lyrics for the Eagles song ‘Hotel California’ written in Don Henley's hand,"" for $8,500 on April 25, 2012, according to the indictment.

Henley testified to a grand jury that he never gave the biographer the lyrics and reported them stolen in 2012 after Inciardi and Kosinski began to offer them at auction houses.

Last week, Irving Azoff, the Eagles' longtime manager, testified that handwritten ""Hotel California"" lyric pages were initially ""stolen"" by Sanders.

""All these lyrics are very personal to him, they’re a part of musical history, and it was simply unacceptable to him that they be stolen by anyone else,"" Azoff testified. He admitted that he had never known Henley to give away any of his work, including most of the lyrics he created with fellow Eagles co-founder Glenn Frey.

Despite her celebrity, Taylor Swift has been able to maintain some anonymity when it comes to her private life.

When the pop star started dating NFL stud Travis Kelce, showing up at his highly televised football games, the world thought they'd cracked into Swift's code.

However, Kansas City Chiefs defensive backs coach Dave Merritt is sharing how Swift was able to support Kelce without the public's knowledge in the beginning of their relationship.

""When she started to come around, it was privately. She was coming into the stadiums without people really knowing until the camera put, you know, a big spotlight on it,"" Merritt revealed on ""The Sports Shop with Reese and K-Mac"" show.

Swift was first spotted at Arrowhead Stadium during week 3 of the NFL season, when the Chiefs defeated the Chicago Bears.

In an interview with TIME last year, Swift disclosed the timeline of their relationship, admitting she and Kelce were already dating when the cameras caught her supporting him.

""By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,"" Swift explained. ""I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.""

Cameras cut to Swift a significant number of times during that game.

Merritt touched upon the negative press Swift garnered throughout the season, sharing why he thought Swift was nothing but a positive influence for the Chiefs.

""Upon meeting her, I felt like she actually added to what it was that we were trying to do. Cause there were so many people that were hating the fact that she was being shown on the TV,"" he suggested. ""You know what, you're a part of our family because you're now with Travis. So therefore, you're our little sister… whatever it may be. You're part of [the] family,"" he said.

""She actually affected the team in a positive way. It wasn’t a negative way,"" he added. ""Everybody was excited that Travis was happy. So when my player, my brother, is happy beside me, that helps me and that encourages me and so Travis came in there a different man,"" he said of the tight end.

""So, she helped us,"" he said, before joking the ""Bad Blood"" singer had successfully won her first Super Bowl during her first season in the NFL.

Swift has noted in the past that her intention in attending games has never been to be on camera.

""I don’t know how they know what suite I’m in,"" she told TIME of photographers at the games. ""There’s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don’t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don’t know if I’m being shown 17 times or once.""

In court Friday, ""Rust"" director Joel Souza described the moment he was shot by actor Alec Baldwin.

Souza, who was shot in the shoulder on October 21, 2021 on the set of the Western film, recalled what he was doing in the moments right before the gun went off. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and Souza were working to stage a close-up scene involving Baldwin and a revolver, when the gun the actor was holding discharged – killing Hutchins.

""I went inside [the church] again to see, to try to see what the angle was, there were a lot of voices,"" he recalled during his testimony at ""Rust"" armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed's trial. ""I heard Alec's voice. I heard Halyna's voice, everyone sort of talking at once. I don't have a clear memory of how long I was standing behind her. I know I got up behind her to . . . try to see on the monitor, and there was an incredibly loud bang that was not like the half and quarter loads you hear on a set. Those are sort of, they're loud poofs and pops. This was deafening.""

""And it felt like somebody had taken a baseball bat to my shoulder. I remember that distinctly and sort of stumbling back and shouting. I don't remember exactly what I said.""

CONVICTED ‘RUST’ ASSISTANT DIRECTOR TESTIFIES ABOUT TENSE FINAL MOMENTS BEFORE FATAL SHOOTING

Souza stumbled back and saw Hutchins being lowered to the ground, but the director still couldn't make sense of what had happened. ""Nothing made sense,"" he told the jury. ""I, I remember initially thinking, ‘Had she been startled by it, and they were sitting her down . . . as a result?’ And then I, I saw the blood on her back.""

The set became ""very chaotic"" immediately after the shooting.

""I remember them laying me down. I remember them laying her down next to me, although we were sort of facing in opposite directions. My head was this way, her head was that way. I remember a lot of panic. I still just couldn't figure out what had happened. I just I thought, ‘Was there something that had been stuck in the barrel that came out?’ but just nothing made sense.""

Souza was surprised to find out how long he had laid next to Hutchins before being taken to the hospital and testified that it had felt like five minutes. He recalled Gutierrez Reed standing above him ""looking distraught"" and apologizing before people were ""screaming"" at her.

At the hospital, Souza didn't even know he had been shot.

""I knew something got me, but they kept saying – they kept talking about this bullet. And it just could not compute for me,"" he said. ""I just kept saying, 'You don't understand. No, no, no. This was a movie set. You know, that's not possible. You don't get it.' And they kept saying, ‘No, no, it is.’ And I just keep insisting, 'you don't understand because this is not possible. It's just not possible that there's a live round. It's not. It just can't.'""

""And then they eventually maybe grew tired of my protesting it, because they showed me the X-ray of my back and there was a very large bullet in it.""

Souza's testimony answered a few important questions, according to former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani.

""Souza’s testimony was somewhat helpful for the prosecution,"" the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers told Fox News Digital. ""He didn’t support the defense argument that the set was sloppy and unprofessional, and he testified that Gutierrez Reed was not required to be outside the church, despite her statement to law enforcement that COVID-19 protocols required her to be outside.""

""[Assistant director Dave Halls'] testimony was much more important and relevant,"" Rahmani noted. ""He told jurors that Gutierrez Reed loaded the gun, and that she conducted a safety check of the gun, but not fully. He also said that Gutierrez Reed gave the gun to Baldwin. I think prosecutors made a mistake by giving Halls a deal before trial. He has denied giving Baldwin the gun or saying it’s a cold gun, so there may be problems with his testimony. And giving him a misdemeanor offer when he admitted to being negligent doesn’t make a lot of sense.""

Later Friday, the set medic took the stand to testify about her experience providing treatment to an injured Hutchins. Cherlyn Schaefer helped locate the cinematographer's entry and exit wounds before instructing someone to keep on the injuries. The set medic also administered oxygen to Hutchins using a mask.

""With the way that [Hutchins] was bleeding, I knew … she was going to need more than … we could provide, or an ambulance could provide, or Santa Fe hospitals could provide,"" Cherlyn Schaefer told the jury. ""She needed to go to the trauma center in Albuquerque.""

Schaefer has a pending civil lawsuit against Gutierrez Reed and other members of Rust productions, including prop master Sarah Zachry. ""I'm not thinking about that case,"" she testified in court Friday. ""I am thinking about the fact that had our armorer or first AD done their jobs, we would not be here. A woman would not be dead. A mother would not be gone.""

Schaefer explained she chose to testify in Gutierrez Reed's trial because she wanted to bring ""change.""

""I did not want something like this to be able to happen again to anybody else, to their families, to the crew that knows them as family. I wanted some sort of change to happen, some policy change, whether it be required to have a stand-by ambulance or it be required to have additional medics if there's going to be big stunts or big gunfire or anything that could potentially cause, you know, somebody to become injured.

""I wanted that change in our industry because … on that show, there were 75 – roughly 75 crew. That is minimal compared to what I normally would have on set. I would have no less than 300 usually before I would be approved to have an additional medic to come and help me. That is just not okay. That is not okay. And being the only medic there with two patients, knowing my resources were not close enough to help in any significant way, is what I wanted to change.""

Gutierrez Reed is on trial for involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering in connection with the fatal shooting of Hutchins. The armorer was 24-years-old at the time of the on-set shooting.

Prosecutors have accused the armorer of being ""unprofessional and sloppy"" and ""negligent"" on the Western film set, directly causing the death of Hutchins. The prosecution also claimed that Gutierrez-Reed was the crew member who had brought the live ammo to the set in the first place, an issue that has long plagued the two-year investigation.

Meanwhile, Gutierrez Reed's defense blamed Baldwin and the production company behind ""Rust"" for the fatal shooting and argued that his client had been used as a ""scapegoat.""

""You will hear that Hollywood actors are not allowed to point guns, real guns at other actors or crew,"" Jason Bowles told the jury. ""It's . . . like every other safety with guns in any other place in society. You learn these rules and go into the classes. You learn these rules if you've ever owned a gun. Rule No. 1: Never point a firearm at somebody unless you intend to shoot them. And that rule was broken.""

Baldwin is also facing involuntary manslaughter charges as his trial is set to begin in July.

Sofia Vergara is taking on the role of late Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco – and the son of the real-life ""Cocaine Godmother"" isn’t happy.

The former ""Modern Family"" actress is starring in Netflix's ""Griselda,"" where she also serves as an executive producer. The series explores the rise and downfall of Blanco, a single mother of four who rose to infamy as a cartel leader before she was gunned down in 2012 at age 69. Blanco, who led a cocaine-fueled empire with an iron fist during the ‘70s and ‘80s, has often been labeled as ""the female Pablo Escobar.""

Blanco’s surviving son slammed the series, labeling it ""disrespectful.""

COCAINE GODMOTHER'S SON EXPLAINS WHY HE’S PURSUING REALITY TV FAME WITH ‘CARTEL CREW’

""Sofia Vergara did not consult with any members of the Blanco family as a sign of respect or elicit family details in portraying my mother,"" Michael Corleone Blanco claimed to Fox News Digital.

""When I learned of the ‘Griselda’ project, my team reached out to Sofia's camp and offered my consultation services,"" the 45-year-old alleged.

Michael also alleged that following an invitation to sit with Vergara’s team, he was told ""there was no room on the project."" He claimed the series was made without involvement from any members of his family.

""Sofia’s camp and the Netflix creators were disrespectful and ultimately produced the ‘Griselda’ project on their own for commercial gain, without key details from the Blanco family,"" he claimed. ""After the sit-down at the table, my lawyers formally sent a cease-and-desist letter to Netflix and Sofia’s camp. As of today, Netflix nor Sofia’s camp has made any attempt to reconcile.""

""Regardless of public information, basic respect is warranted,"" Michael continued. ""I am Griselda’s only living son that has life rights agreements signed by Griselda herself in which she intended I carry out her life story. I am a businessman in the entertainment industry and comprehend the importance of motion pictures as I have a book to be released, based on the real story.""

Michael has written a memoir, ""My Mother, The Godmother."" He also announced a YouTube podcast, ""The Real Griselda with Michael Corleone,"" which aims to tell ""the true story.""

A spokesperson for Vergara, 51, and Netflix didn’t immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

In an interview with the U.K’s Daily Mail, Michael hit out at the show for portraying his mother as ""ugly."" According to the outlet, Vergara had to undergo two hours' worth of prosthetics to transform into the matriarch.

""My mother was a beautiful woman, and it’s crazy that a lot of people say, ‘No, you’ve got to look more like a drug addict’… The fact that they called her ‘ugly,’ that really offends me. People see the mug shots and just go from that, but when you read my book, you’ll see that my mother was called the porcelain doll in her youth.""

""All I have to say is that if my mother was alive, she wouldn’t have got away with it,"" he said, referring to Vergara. ""No matter what, you need to respect my mother enough to seek the consultation of [her] youngest son – her best friend who visited her five times a week during her… incarceration.""

Michael previously claimed he turned his life around after his mother was killed by a motorcycle-riding assassin. He has spoken about his mother over the years and appeared in the VH1 reality TV series ""Cartel Crew"" in 2019.

According to the network, the series aimed to look at the lives of eight cartel descendants ""as they navigate adulthood and the effects the legacy has had on their upbringing.""

Blanco, who grew up in the slums of Medellín and was murdered there, commanded a ruthless crew that shipped an average of 3,400 pounds of cocaine per month to the U.S., the Miami Herald reported. She is said to have inspired and even groomed Pablo Escobar.

Blanco's reign of terror started in the '70s, Newsweek reported, noting that unofficial tallies link her organization with at least 250 murders. She is believed to be the mastermind behind the drive-by motorcycle shooting and earned the nickname ""Black Widow"" for allegedly killing her three husbands. Two of her sons were later assassinated.

Police caught up with her in 1985, resulting in Blanco spending 19 years in U.S. prisons before cutting a deal in 2004 and being deported. She reportedly kept a low profile in her final years before her death.

Shortly before the premiere of ""Cartel Crew,"" Michael told Fox News Digital that he wasn't worried about putting his life in front of cameras.

""As far as being worried, there’s a certain element you always have to factor in,"" he explained at the time. ""We were trained to always be in situations where you have to be alarmed. That’s just life. That’s how we grew up, that’s how I grew up. That being said, we’re living in a new time. We’re living in a new era. This is the era of social media. This is the era of TV shows, and movies, of ‘Narcos’ on Netflix. So I think that anybody’s entitled to tell their story.

""Fear? No, fear doesn’t live here. I fear the wrath of God, that’s what I say.""

In 2012, the Miami New Times reported mother and son sold the rights to their life stories to First Born Films after Blanco was the subject of a 2006 documentary, ""Cocaine Cowboys."" In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter announced Jennifer Lopez was poised to play Blanco in an HBO movie. Then in 2017, Catherine Zeta-Jones starred as Blanco in the Lifetime TV film, ""Cocaine Godmother.""

""I’m all for J. Lo playing my mother,"" said Michael. ""She was one of my original choices. Catherine Zeta-Jones’ project was great as well. I’m all for it. Anything that I can lend consultation on my life. As long as it’s a lucrative project.… As long as the story is told correctly from the horse’s mouth. Meaning from myself and other family members.""

Michael was given the middle name ""Corleone"" after Al Pacino's character in ""The Godfather."" The film, which premiered in 1972, chronicles how an aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his empire to his reluctant son.

""I’m not going to sugarcoat it,"" said Michael. ""My mother wasn’t a saint, I’m aware of that. But the truth is, she was my mother. She took care of me.""

Michael said he was 5 years old when he realized his family was different.

SOFIA VERGARA GETS HONEST ABOUT DIVORCE IN THE PUBLIC EYE: 'THAT'S PART OF BEING A CELEBRITY'

""I understood we had more than anybody,"" he recalled. ""I understood my father wasn’t the boss. My mother was telling everybody what to do and that she was the boss. We would move after she moved. I understood my mother was the queen of the castle. I understood she wasn’t a regular person.""

According to reports, Blanco first became involved in the drug trade as a desperate means to support her children. Vergara told ""CBS Mornings"" that she saw Blanco like Tony Soprano from ""The Sopranos.""

""A character that people didn’t hate,"" said Vergara. ""Even though he was a bad guy.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The 28-year-old television personality, who is the lead of the reality dating show's current season, revealed in a video that his ""yellow eyes"" are caused by Gilbert syndrome.

""I wanted to jump on here really quick and talk about something that I'm seeing a lot of comments about, which is Joey's yellow eyes,"" Graziadei said at the beginning of the clip he shared on Thursday.

‘THE BACHELOR’ JOEY GRAZIADEI'S ‘BIG RED FLAG’ IS SOMEONE ‘TOO SELF-CENTERED’

He continued, ""To give some context on that, I have to go all the way back to when I was in high school. I was sick for about a week and a half, and my mom thought it would be a good idea to go to the doctor.""

""When I went to the doctor. I had bloodwork done, and the bloodwork showed that my bilirubin count was very high. That means that there could be something that was wrong with my liver.""

Bilirubin is the yellow pigment in bile, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

""You might have high bilirubin levels if your liver is having trouble processing bilirubin into bile, or if your bile ducts are blocked,"" the medical center states on its website. ""High bilirubin may indicate liver or biliary disease.""

However, Graziadei said that he had been diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome.

According to the Mayo Clinic, Gilbert syndrome is a ""common, harmless liver condition in which the liver doesn't properly process bilirubin."" The condition is usually genetic and requires no treatment. Gilbert syndrome presents as ""occasional yellowish tinge of the skin and the whites of the eyes as a result of slightly higher levels of bilirubin in the blood.""

""At the end of the day, I am told that I am healthy,"" Graziadei explained. ""It's something that does affect the whites of my eyes and makes it have those jaundice levels, which is why they look a little bit more yellow.""

He continued, ""It's something I want to pay attention to more going into this year. I want to get my health right and make sure that I'm all good. But I at least wanted to give some background and let you know that, to my knowledge, I am healthy.""

""It's just something that I have to pay attention to drinking more fluids. It is worse when I have stress or lack of sleep, which happens on a TV show,"" he said with a smile.

Drew Barrymore revealed she is a fan of sex in the skies.

""Doesn’t it feel wild? It’s not the same,"" she told Christina Aguilera after the two bonded over both being members of the ""Mile High Club.""

While chatting on her talk show, Barrymore added, ""If you’re curious like ‘Why are people doing it?’ I’m telling you, elevation, it feels different. I can’t recommend it more. Sorry FAA!""

""I was like, ‘Whoa!’"" she continued, laughing.

""You have to,"" the singer said. ""We spend a lot of time on planes. We’ve got to figure it out.""

The behavior can be risky though. Those who engage in sex on a passenger plane could potentially face arrest for indecent exposure or interfering with a flight crew.

The two women also bonded over how their daughters have used their racy pasts to push the boundaries with clothing choices.

Barrymore shared, ""My daughter wants to wear a crop top, and I’ll say ‘No,’ and she’ll say, ‘You were on the cover of ‘Playboy.’""

Aguilera said she does not want to ""scare"" her daughter and have her ""be afraid of the world"" but ""I think it’s important for her to have a strong sense of self but also to be very empowered with her body.""

The ""Genie in a Bottle"" singer added that she felt, with ""Dirrty"" and Barrymore’s ""Playboy"" cover, ""We were expressing ourselves and how it felt best, I think, at the time,"" adding that it was not about pleasing anyone else.

Olivia Wilde

Olivia Wilde made jaws drop when she went braless under a sheer bodysuit on the red carpet at the Saint Laurent fashion show in Paris. Wilde paired the bodysuit with a brown pencil skirt, and accessorized with black tights, brown opera gloves, a brown belt and sunglasses.

The actress and director went through a very public breakup with her longtime fiancé Jason Sudeikis in November 2020. They finalized their custody agreement three years later, in September 2023. She then dated singer Harry Styles from January 2021 to November 2022, after they met on the set of ""Don't Worry Darling.""

Wilde and Sudeikis share son Otis and daughter Daisy. In a recent interview with People, Wilde opened up about her two kids, saying that ""we have so much fun,"" and said one of their favorite activities as a family is singing karaoke.

""My go-to changes. It changes a lot. Right now we have a lot of Taylor Swift happening in our house,"" she said about her song choice. ""It's wall-to-wall Taylor and Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. And now Daisy has brought in Dua Lipa, but we're like Taylor first.""

Jennifer Lawrence

Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence wore a three-piece charcoal suit to the fashion house's runway show during Paris Fashion Week. She spiced up the look by going shirtless under the vest, fully embracing the plunging neckline.

Lawrence, who is married to art gallery director Cooke Maroney, walked the carpet solo. She recently spoke about their wedding weekend during an interview at the Golden Globes, where she called the experience ""awful.""

The actress recalled spending the whole time worrying about whether her guests were having fun, and not having any fun herself. She even asked Robert De Niro to leave her rehearsal dinner, because she felt he didn't want to be there. Lawrence told E! News that having him leave ""genuinely made [her] feel better.""

""I'll never forget — I was freaking out about the guests being cold, and all of my friends were lying. They're like, ‘Nobody's cold, nobody's cold, everything's fine, everything's fine,'"" she told People on the carpet. ""My mom was like, ‘It's freezing out there, your grandmother almost died.""

Zoë Kravitz

Zoë Kravitz also got daring with her appearance at the Saint Laurent fashion show, wearing a sheer knee-length brown dress with a black belt around her waist. She paired the look with diamond earrings, and wore her hair in a slicked back bun.

The ""Big Little Lies"" star and her fiancé, actor Channing Tatum, were photographed in October in their Halloween costumes, with Kravitz sporting her engagement ring in public for the first time.

When speaking to GQ in November 2022, Kravitz explained their decision to keep their relationship private, saying it was important for them to do that ""so that you don’t have to even think about what the world thinks about it.""

""He’s just a wonderful human,"" she explained. ""He makes me laugh, and we both really love art and talking about art and the exploration of why we do what we do. We love to watch a film and break it down and talk about it and challenge each other.""

Linda Evangelista

Linda Evangelista wore an all-black ensemble to the Saint Laurent fashion show. She walked the carpet in a black coat with a black turtleneck underneath and black tights.

The supermodel was recently announced as one of the faces of Donna Karen New York's relaunch, along with Cindy Crawford, Karlie Kloss, Amber Valletta, Shalom Harlow and a few others.

When speaking with People in February, Evangelista explained she enjoys working with Donna Karen, because ""Donna believed more in women than anybody"" and ""you can be whoever you want to be in her clothes.""

""I remember the pep talks before the fashion shows,"" she explained. ""The backstage felt more personal. She would try to instill this confidence in us, but once you were wearing her clothes, you didn’t need it. Donna’s been part of the milestone moments that I’ve had.""

Kate Moss

Kate Moss walked the red carpet at the Saint Laurent fashion show during Paris Fashion Week in a double-breasted black fur coat, wearing her hair in a bun.

The supermodel recently celebrated her 50th birthday, telling The Sunday Times in September she is in denial about the milestone. She joked with the outlet, ""No. I’m not thinking about it. I do not feel 50.""

Moss told the outlet she continues to go out as she gets older, but now follows a strict bedtime.

""I’m not really into it. I do get Fomo [fear of missing out] sometimes, like, ‘Oh, I wish I’d gone to that or was hanging out with everybody,’"" she explained. ""When I do go out I leave at midnight — that’s my cut-off. I’ve seen everyone, everyone’s talked sense. After that [time], people start repeating themselves. So then I go home.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Tish Cyrus reportedly went to great lengths to keep her daughter Noah away from her summer nuptials to ""Prison Break"" star Dominic Purcell, whom Noah had casually dated.

A source told Fox News Digital that to ensure Noah did not attend the ceremony, held at her sister Miley Cyrus' Malibu home, Tish hired security. Noah's own home in Malibu is located blocks away from her sister's residence.

The source added that at the time of the wedding, Miley was unaware of the relationship Noah, 24, and Purcell, 54 had shared. Fox News Digital was also previously told that Noah and Purcell were seeing each other on and off and later cut ties. When Tish began dating the British-Australian actor in 2022, she was privy of Noah's history with him, although there was no overlap.

Engaged in April 2023, Tish, 56, married Purcell in August. When pictures surfaced online of the wedding, fans were perplexed by Noah and her older brother Braison's absence.

Tish's two children, Brandi, 36, and Trace, 35, from a previous relationship, attended the wedding and were photographed in family photos with Purcell and two of his four children for Vogue Weddings.

As previously reported, Noah and Braison allegedly spent their mother's wedding day together at Walmart, where Noah donned a Billy Ray Cyrus shirt and posted a cryptic message about loving her father to her Instagram stories.

The insider told Fox News Digital that during this outing, Braison was consoling his sister due to the gravity of the situation. They added that Braison's tendency to be upfront with his mother is why he was left off the guest list.

Anson Williams recalled fearing for his life during a scary incident with a mob of fans at the height of his ""Happy Days"" fame.

The 74-year-old actor starred as gullible aspiring singer Warren ""Potsie"" Weber on the sitcom for 11 seasons from 1974 to 1984. During an interview with Fox News Digital, Williams revealed that he had ""many, many crazy"" encounters with fans after ""Happy Days"" became a massive hit. He then recounted one particular experience that stood out in his memory.

""Yeah, almost dying comes to mind,"" Williams said.

He continued, ""I was doing a concert at the Del Mar Racetrack [in Del Mar, California]. Like a 4th of July concert, I forgot exactly — I think it was 4th of July. And there were like thousands of people there.""

""And I'm in the middle on this stage they rolled out,"" Williams added. ""Well, at the end of the concert, the crowd swarms around this [stage], and I can't get down. I can't get off. So, I'm up there. I must have been up there for 15 minutes.""

""And there's security. Finally, I get down and they kind of make a pathway. Well, the crowd overwhelmed it. I ended up face-down. On the field. Literally, I couldn't breathe,"" he recalled.

""Shirt's being torn, bleeding. My manager finally picked me up and literally dragged me and threw me into this trailer that was kind of on the edge of the part of the field there. Yeah. I mean, I literally — I literally couldn't breathe.""

""And I'm thinking, 'I don't know about this fame stuff,'"" he said with a laugh. ""You know, might not be … the healthiest thing for your life.""

Though the experience was terrifying, Williams told Fox News Digital that his injuries weren't severe enough that he had to go to the hospital.

""But I had scratches and like a face full of dirt,"" he remembered with a laugh. ""I said, 'Maybe, I'll go back to engineering.' You know, this is not so nice.""

Williams said he couldn't remember the exact year in which the incident occurred, but he believed it was probably in 1976 or 1977. He also explained that it proved to be a learning experience for him.

""I learned a lot, you know, where not to place myself during a concert,"" Williams said. ""That I learned. Don't go in the middle of a field surrounded by thousands of people with no way out. It's not a very smart place to put one's body.""

WATCH: ‘Happy Days’ star Anson Williams on how show was almost canceled before becoming a mega-hit

Set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, ""Happy Days"" was originally conceived to tap into the public's nostalgia for the 1950s era amid turbulent times in the 1970s. The show followed the lives of teenager Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard), his family, including father Howard (Tom Bosley), mother Marion (Marion Ross), sister Joanie (Erin Moran) and his friends, Potsie (Williams), Ralph Malph (Donny Most) and Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli (Henry Winkler).

Upon its debut, the show was met with mixed reviews but enjoyed immediate popularity with viewers. By the time ""Happy Days"" began airing its fourth season, the show had become the most-watched series in the U.S.

However, Williams recalled that the future of ""Happy Days"" was in jeopardy after ratings began to slip before a format change spearheaded by creator Garry Marshall and director Jerry Paris paved the way for its surge in popularity.

""When we first started in '74, it was a minor — it was a hit,"" Williams said. ""It was in the top 20, maybe 15 or something.""

""We came in at mid-season,"" he continued. ""And then the next season, it started going down to 48th place. But we're filming it like a movie, you know, just like a normal movie. And we were on the verge of getting canceled.""

""And Garry Marshall and Jerry Paris, our director, thought, ‘What if we changed the whole tone? What if we make it a live audience sitcom?’"" Williams recalled. ""So, half the season, one camera. The next season, one camera. The next season — two and a half in — they switch it to live audience. And the chemistry of the cast, the writing, was magic. That's the year we went to No. 1 in the world. That's when we exploded.""

‘HAPPY DAYS’ STAR ANSON WILLIAMS RECALLS 45-YEAR FRIENDSHIP WITH LATE CINDY WILLIAMS: ‘JUST HAD THIS SPARK

""In the last 10 and a half years, that was huge,"" he added. ""Who knew? Who knows? But more than just being on a hit television show, it was such an education for life. I mean, we just had so many life experiences.""

Williams told Fox News Digital that Marshall tried to prepare the cast for the massive fame that they would experience due to the show's success and advised them to use their platforms for good.

""Gary said, 'You guys are young, and you're going to have a light on you,'"" he remembered. ""'You're going to be famous and you don't deserve it. But you are going to have a light on you. You got to take the light, and you got to shine it on people that deserve it. You got to make things better, you know? So, get out of your way and just help other people.'""

The Golden Globe nominee told Fox News Digital that the cast took Marshall's advice to heart and aimed to help by making movies that highlighted societal issues and featured underrepresented groups of people.

""Ron Howard and I did a film called ‘Skyward,’ starring the first paraplegic ever in the history of television,"" he said. ""We did films like ‘No Greater Gift,’ which doubled organ donorship cards. Henry did so many social issue movies of the week and after-school school specials, and charities.""

""We really, to this day, try to shine the light to make things better,"" he added.

Williams explained that helping people was also the impetus behind his latest project, ""Crazy Mama,"" which he created with his wife, Sharon Scott Williams.

Starring two-time Emmy Award nominee Lee Purcell, ""Crazy Mama"" is a one-woman play with musical accompaniment that is based on Sharon's memoir, ""Crazy Mama, A Memoir of Love and Madness.""

The book was the winner of the 2014 Southwest Writers Competition and won the Santa Barbara Writers Conference Fiction Award, per Sharon's website. Sharon adapted her memoir into the script for the play, which Williams is directing.

The play chronicles the ""soul-crushing grip of her mother’s mental illness, the steely resilience of the human heart, and how, by the grace of some invisible power, Sharon’s dream to get her real Mama back comes true,"" according to a press release.

""It's shining a light on mental illness again in a very entertaining way that I truly know is going to help,"" Williams said of ""Crazy Mama. ""It's truly going to help families. It's truly going to echo and go on and on and on and really have a positive effect on the mental illness in this country.""

""Crazy Mama"" will be staged April 12-14 at the Theater of The Museum at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts in Bethel, New York.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Drake Bell appeared in a new teaser clip for the ""Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV"" docuseries as an alleged victim of Brian Peck.

The former Nickelodeon star was only featured for a few seconds toward the end of the trailer, which highlighted fellow network stars curious to see ""who was being hurt"" by Peck.

""Former Nickelodeon star Drake Bell will be sharing publicly, for the first time, the story of the abuse he suffered at the hands of Brian Peck,"" the clip was captioned.

Peck served as a dialogue coach at Nickelodeon, both for ""All That"" and ""The Amanda Show,"" which Bell starred on from 1999-2002.

Bell later received his own series with the network and starred on ""Drake & Josh"" from 2004-07.

Peck was accused of molesting a child in 2003 and was later charged with eight counts of sexual abuse. Peck was convicted of a lewd act against a child and oral copulation of a person under the age of 16 and spent 16 months in prison.

He was also required to register as a sex offender in October 2004.

Representatives for Bell and Peck did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Allegations against Peck recently came to light during an episode of ""Pod Meets World"" when Will Friedle and Rider Strong addressed complicated feelings toward Peck, who became their friend while he worked as a stand-in on ""Boy Meets World.""

Friedle, Strong and co-star Danielle Fishel decided to bring Peck's name to the table after being contacted for a statement about Peck, likely due to the upcoming ""Quiet on Set"" ID docuseries detailing child abuse that allegedly took place behind the scenes on several Nickelodeon shows.

""There's no way I could have been manipulated like this because I was an adult,"" Friedle said. ""By the time I had heard what had happened, I had known this man for years and years, had no idea that any of this was going on, obviously, and the idea that now at 24 or whatever I was, 24 or 25 when I found out about it — that I didn't know, couldn't spot it — that was a failure of my own.""

Peck, who was in his 40s at the time, only appeared in two episodes of the teenage sitcom — which ran from 1993-2000 on ABC — but quickly befriended both Friedle and Strong.

Long after the show had ended, Friedle remembered Peck had called him crying when the sexual abuse allegations surfaced. Friedle recalled Peck spinning the story to show how it was ""clearly the fault of his victim.""

""My instinct initially was, ‘My friend, this can’t be. It’s gotta be the other person’s fault.’ The story makes complete sense the way that he’s saying it,"" he said.

Strong remembered Peck admitting to the crime , but spinning the assault so that it appeared as though Peck was the victim.

""It was always in the context of, ‘I did this thing. I am guilty. I am going to take whatever punishment the government determines, but I’m a victim of jailbait. There was this hot guy. I just did this thing, and he’s underage.’ And we bought that storyline,"" Strong said.

Peck also asked Strong and Friedle to stand by him in court and write letters to the judge in support of Peck. Friedle remembered one victim's mother telling the court, ""Look at all the famous people you brought with you. And it doesn’t change what you did to my kid.""

Friedle has not seen Peck in 20 years, but still has remorse for what he experienced as a bystander in Peck's life.

""There’s an actual victim here. And he turned us against the victim to where now we’re on his team,"" Friedle said. ""That’s the thing where, to me, I look back at that as my ever-loving shame for this entire [thing]. Getting taken in by somebody who’s a good actor and a manipulator, I could chalk that up to being young and that’s the way it is. It’s awful.

""I’m going to use that for my growth as a human being, but when there’s an actual victim involved, and now I’m on the abuser’s side, that’s the thing I can’t get over and haven’t been able to get over.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Natalie Portman may be giving a hint about her relationship status.

The ""May December"" star posted a photo of herself on Instagram, holding up the book ""Heartburn"" by Nora Ephron, the screenwriter behind classics like ""When Harry Met Sally.""

The book was inspired by Ephron’s marital troubles with her second husband, Carl Bernstein, including his affair with the daughter of a former British prime minister.

In the caption of her post, Portman wrote, ""Excited to finally read Nora Ephron’s ‘Heartburn,’ her classic transformation of pain into humorous art. Looking forward to hearing what you all think!""

The book is part of the Oscar-winner’s ongoing book club, serving as the pick for March.

""Heartburn’s"" subject matter relating to cheating is also causing speculation about Portman’s marriage to choreographer Benjamin Millepied.

Their marital status has been in question since February 2023, when a French outlet published that Millepied had an affair.

In June 2023, a source told People the alleged affair was ""short-lived"" and ""over,"" saying, ""He knows he made an enormous mistake and he is doing all he can to get Natalie to forgive him and keep their family together.""

Last month, in the Vanity Fair Hollywood issue, Portman acknowledged the speculation about her marriage, but didn’t clarify what was happening.

""It’s terrible, and I have no desire to contribute to it,"" she told the outlet.

At the time, representatives for Portman did not respond to Fox News Digital's immediate request for comment.

Portman and Millepied met while working on the film ""Black Swan,"" in 2009, which Portman won the best actress Oscar for. Millepied was hired as a choreographer to help teach Portman ballet, and appeared in the film as the main male dancer of the ballet company.

They later married in 2012 and share two children: Aleph and Amalia.

Portman splits her time between Los Angeles and Paris, which she referred to as ""complementary"" cities in her Vanity Fair interview.

""I lead a very non-Hollywood life in LA. I live on the east side. I have some friends who are in the entertainment industry, but many friends who are not, and we don’t do industry things when we hang out,"" Portman said. ""We’re not going to Hollywood parties, we’re having dinners at home in the backyard.""

""I actually found that living there made my experience of LA much less ‘Hollywood,’"" she added. ""When I would visit, it would only be for work, and I’d be staying somewhere in Beverly Hills, and I’d be having industry meetings and going to industry parties. Living there made my experience much more rounded and appreciative of all the city has to offer, from nature to the arts, food to music, and of course, the people.""

In a lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles, Leviss accused Sandoval of recording their private communications, and believes some of the unlawfully obtained recordings ""depict her in a state of undress and engaged in sex acts,"" according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

Nearly one year ago, Leviss was at the center of what is now dubbed ""Scandoval"" when it was revealed that Leviss, 29, and Sandoval, 40, had been having an affair while he was in a long-term relationship with his now ex-girlfriend Madix, 38.

Their affair came to light when Sandoval dropped his phone while performing with his band at his Tom Tom bar in West Hollywood on March 1. An attendee allegedly handed the phone over to Madix, who ""searched it and found sexually explicit videos of Leviss"" on his device.

Leviss claimed in the suit that the videos were ""recorded by Sandoval without her knowledge or consent in or around February 2023.""

""Leviss has every reason to assume there are additional illicit videos and/or photographs of her that she has not yet seen,"" the documents stated.

""Madix has obtained at least two illicit videos of Leviss and distributed them and/or showed them to others without Leviss' knowledge or consent.""

Following a taping of ""Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,"" Leviss and cast member Scheana Shay were at a bar when Leviss received a text from Madix which stated, ""you are DEAD TO ME,"" according to the docs.

""Included with the message were the two videos of Leviss that Madix had purportedly discovered on Sandoval's phone,"" the lawsuit stated. ""Leviss experienced a swirl of emotions in response, including shock and fear."" Shortly after the message came through, she described how Shay ""violently assaulted Leviss, shoving her aggressively into brick wall, punching her in the face, and throwing her phone into the street.""

Leviss requested a temporary restraining order against Shay, which was later dismissed.

Days after news of the affair went public, Leviss confronted Sandoval for ""secretly recording pornographic videos of her and storing them unprotected on his phone,"" according to the lawsuit.

""Sandoval was clearly rattled. After filming ended, an erratic and unsettled Sandoval refused to leave Leviss’s apartment in spite of her requests. Leviss was forced to have her sister and brother-in-law pick her up and drive her to their home.""

She checked herself into a mental health facility days later.

""Lost in the mix was that Leviss was a victim of the predatory and dishonest behavior of an older man, who recorded sexually explicit videos of her without her knowledge or consent, which were then distributed, disseminated and discussed publicly by a scorned woman seeking vengeance, catalyzing the scandal,"" the lawsuit stated.

Leviss was also ""subjected to a gag order prohibiting her from discussing Sandoval’s gross invasion of her privacy,"" which prevented her from publicly defending herself in a move implemented by Bravo and Evolution Media, according to the complaint.

She is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and also requested the defendants destroy the alleged videos.
