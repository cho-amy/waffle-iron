EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

Instances of antisemitism and Islamophobia have both risen in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, when militants entered the southern part of the country and slaughtered more than 1,200 people during a music festival.

Israel has responded with heavy shelling and a ground invasion of Gaza. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not delineate between fighters and civilians, has said that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed so far.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

""The compound is a clearly marked UN facility & its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" Lazzarini wrote on X.

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

""Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,"" the user added. ""If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

""I really appreciate community notes!"" added another.

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father ""because there isn't any,"" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.""

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said.

Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.

SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY

Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.

NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,"" a spokesperson said. ""He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.""

Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.

GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered ""no"" when asked if ""undocumented immigrants"" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.

In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.

But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are ""inherently more unsafe.""

""It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.

""Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,"" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.

""But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,"" he said.

""And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,"" he said.

There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Please enter a valid email address.

The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.

The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a ""bump stock"" device is a ""machine gun"" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""

After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that ""bump stocks"" are machine guns.

The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.

GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several ""bump stocks"" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.

""It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,"" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.

But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.

The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.

""I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.""

Justice Samuel Alito called that ""disturbing.""

""These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.""

A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.

TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE

As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will ""bump"" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.

Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.

The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.

GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'

Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.

The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.

The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.

Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.

The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire ""automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""

Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.

""The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.""

After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, ""Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?""

But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.

""Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ""but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?""

The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.

""This is totally confusing,"" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.

""Now I'm completely lost,"" added Sotomayor at one point.

Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

""If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,"" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.

Supporters of the ban say it saves lives.

""Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,"" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. ""ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.""

A ruling is due by early summer.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had ""devastating consequences,"" and demands immediate action.

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

""Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,"" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. ""Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.""

They added, ""Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.""

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

""We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election.

""If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,"" Haley said in the interview.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House.

""We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,"" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.

While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November.

Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says ""the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.""

""I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,"" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'

Smith’s ""primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,"" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, ""there might not be a trial.""

Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a ""host"" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as ""motivated"" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall.

Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.

HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Manual states, ""Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.

""Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,"" Turley said.

John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.



""If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,"" Shu said. ""It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.

""The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.""

""This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,"" Shu added.

On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, ""Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.""

But, Turley said, ""the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.""

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

""The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,"" Turley said.

""The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection.

""So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.""

Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said ""the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.""

""But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,"" Trusty said.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.

Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.

Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.

Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.

The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.

The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was ""no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.""

Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.

Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.

Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.

""I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,"" Austin said at the time. ""I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis.

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as ""belligerent.""

She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.

McAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it’s ""clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.""

Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state.

""She probably should drop out,"" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. ""I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.""

But Jodi said ""she should still stay in the race.""

""She's a better candidate than Trump,"" she added.

Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday.

""I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,"" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. ""I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.""

""I really don't know what she's doing,"" he continued. ""She's out of control.""

Similarly, Scott said, ""she needs to get out"" of the race. ""It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,"" he added.

KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT

Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman.

""She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do."" George said. ""If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.""

But Dan said he had ""no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.""

""She’s got no path to victory,"" he continued.

Theresa said: ""She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.""

Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination.

""I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.""

Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because ""we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.""

""I like Trump,"" he said. ""Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.""

But Josh said Haley's effort ""seems pointless.""

""It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,"" he told Fox News, ""which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came to the defense of former President Trump in a Wall Street Journal op-ed slamming the recent New York civil fraud court case that ordered the 45th president to pay a $354.8 million fine plus interest.

""Every American has a right to be critical of Mr. Trump’s politics—one of us ran against him in 2016,"" reads Bush’s op-ed, titled, ""Elon Musk and Donald Trump Cases Imperil the Rule of Law.""

""…But equality before the law is precious, and these rulings represent a crisis not only for the soundness of our courts, but for the business environment that has allowed the U.S. to prosper,"" the opinion piece continued. ""If these rulings stand, the damage could cascade through the economy, creating fear of arbitrary enforcement against entrepreneurs who seek public office or raise their voices as citizens in a way that politicians dislike.""

The column, which was co-authored by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, railed against the recent monthslong civil fraud trial against Trump, which resulted in a nearly $355 million fine and bars Trump from operating his business in New York for three years. The opinion piece also spoke out against how a Delaware judge recently rescinded tech billionaire Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation from Tesla.

TRUMP BLASTS 'CLUBHOUSE POLITICIAN' JUDGE AFTER BEING FINED $350M, DEFENDS THE 'GREAT COMPANY' HE BUILT

Bush ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election, when the two exchanged repeated barbs, including personal jabs such as Trump claiming Bush is an ""embarrassment to his family."" In 2018, Bush said Trump is ""Republican in basically name only"" and took another apparent stab at the then-president, saying after he bowed out of the primary that he returned home where his children ""actually love me.""

Following Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, the former Florida governor said Trump ""provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol today.""

""He has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection,"" Bush said in a post at the time. ""Mr. President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy.""

TRUMP BACKS GEORGE P. BUSH, JEB'S SON, IN TEXAS POLITICAL RACE

The op-ed marks a defense of Bush's former 2016 rival, albeit not for Trump’s political stances. Instead, Lonsdale and Bush are calling for a ""dispassionate"" legal system that will not throttle businesses and lead to a weakened economy.

""​​New York and Delaware have played an outsize role in business in the U.S."" the pair wrote. ""Many major companies are incorporated in Delaware owing to the state’s body of corporate legal precedents; and a significant number of banks operate in New York, the world financial capital. The appellate courts in those states now have a chance to review these dangerous judicial rulings and try to stop further damage to the reputations of their respective judiciaries.""

""If they don’t, blue-state politicians may have the satisfaction of ‘sticking it’ to Messrs. Trump and Musk, but the loss to those states will be significant,"" they continued. ""The damage to the legal fabric of the country will be even worse. A dispassionate justice system is at the heart of American exceptionalism, and the country will be poorer if we lose it.""

Trump has since appealed the ruling and repeatedly argued that the presiding judge, Arthur Engoron, and New York Attorney General Letitia James were politically motivated in the case.

FORMER TRUMP RIVAL JEB BUSH CALLS MANHATTAN GRAND JURY INDICTMENT 'VERY POLITICAL'

""A crooked New York judge working with the very corrupt attorney general of New York State, who ran on the basis of ‘I will get trump’ before knowing me — before even knowing anything about me — just ruled that I have to pay a fine of $355 million based on absolutely nothing,"" Trump told Fox News Digital after the fine was announced. ""No victims. No damages. Great financial statements, with full disclaimer clauses, only success.""

NEW YORK AG TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER TRUMP FRAUD RULING: 'JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED'

The op-ed noted that when James was on the campaign trail for the attorney general position, she ran on a campaign ""promise to target the man she called 'an illegitimate president.’""

""The unusual New York law Ms. James used to investigate and sue Mr. Trump didn’t require her to prove that he had intended to defraud anyone, or even that anyone lost money. The Associated Press found that of the 12 cases brought under that law since its adoption in 1956 in which significant penalties were imposed, the case against Mr. Trump was the only instance without an alleged victim or financial loss,"" the pair wrote.

Trump attorneys had asked Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an ""orderly post-judgement process,"" which was denied Thursday afternoon.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News,"Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.

In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.

Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.

When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.

The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.

That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.

ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT

As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.

Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.

TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.

Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.

""We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,"" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. ""The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.""

The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.

The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.

Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.

""If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,"" Kim said.

Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.

""I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,"" she said. ""I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.""

She added: ""Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.""

REPUBLICAN HOPES

The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.

Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.

GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES

Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.

Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send ""ticked off"" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.

A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.

""We’ll come together,"" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. ""The threat from Republicans is too much.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

""Do you think it started before she hired him?"" Merchant asked via text on Jan. 5, three days prior to filing the motion.

""Absolutely,"" Bradley replied.

But in court Tuesday, Bradley claimed he was ""speculating"" in those text message exchanges.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

The tax credit bill received bipartisan support, passing the chamber by a vote of 162-3. It provides a state income tax credit of up to $300 that could be used to pay for training and gun storage devices.

But Democrats decried the second bill banning the merchant code as a giveaway to the gun lobby that would make the state less safe.

STATE DEMS ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘BACKDOOR GUN TAX’ ON LAWFUL FIREARM OWNERS

Both bills now go to the state Senate for consideration.

Merchant category codes exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers. In 2022, Visa and other credit card companies said they would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, though they later put that decision on hold in the face of opposition from the gun lobby and conservative politicians.

There had been hope that categorizing credit and debit card purchases would allow authorities to potentially see red flags — like significant ammunition purchases — before a mass shooting could happen.

Republican state Rep. Jason Ridley, noting the ISO is based in Switzerland, said the code could be used to create a registry of gun sales.

""I don’t care which side of firearms you stand on,"" he said. ""Nobody should know what you’re buying and keeping a registry, especially a foreign country.""

Democratic state Rep. Shea Roberts said the legislation would take away a tool banks could use to detect fraud and law enforcement agencies could use to spot people stockpiling weapons for a possible mass shooting attack.

""It’s what we’ve seen time and time again,"" she said. ""The gun lobby trumps everything.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY TAX BREAKS HURT AMERICA AND HELP CHINA

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

House managers serve as ""prosecutors"" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.

One impeachment manager told Fox they had been given ""no clear guidance"" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.

Fox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Fox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.

RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS

Several factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.

That said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.

Some House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.

A senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a ""comprehensive briefing"" last week and ""detailed"" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.

Despite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that ""we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.""

Some House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.

Fox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing ""mock trial"" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.

HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS

""We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,"" said one frustrated manager.

There has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.

Managers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned ""subject lanes"" to argue before the Senate.

One manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, is threatening to hold Secretary of State Antony Blinken in contempt of Congress, accusing him of failing to hand over key documents related to the U.S.’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

At the heart of the issue are interview notes that were used to put together the State Department’s After-Action Review (AAR) of the Afghanistan withdrawal.

""The Committee’s patience has been exhausted, and it requires these files to complete its investigation and make legislative recommendations for this Congress to consider,"" McCaul wrote.

""Should the Department fail to produce the… files outlined below by March 6, 2024, the Committee is prepared to hold you in contempt of Congress.""

'UNACCEPTABLE': TALIBAN DEMANDED TREATMENT 'SIMILAR TO RECOGNITION' TO ATTEND UN MEETING

He also accused Blinken of choosing ""politics over policy"" with the State Department’s decision to ""withhold"" the documents.

It’s notably harsh language for McCaul, whose relationship with Blinken is relatively more cordial than that of other House Republican committee chairs investigating the Biden administration.

In his letter, he noted multiple instances in which McCaul accused the department of stonewalling, including after he first requested notes from interviews with State officials taken by then-Ambassador Dan Smith, who led the AAR in September 2023.

He also listed ways in which the committee sought to accommodate the department. For example, McCaul wrote that the committee offered to redact names and address security concerns after State officials told him providing the notes would have a ""significant chilling effect on the Department’s ability to conduct thorough and impactful lessons learned efforts to improve our foreign policy-making.""

THINK THE US EXIT FROM AFGHANISTAN WAS BAD? LOOK WHAT'S BREWING IN THE PACIFIC

""On November 28, 2023, the Committee once more requested the interview notes, stating that the Department had failed to produce any high-priority items in its last eight productions,"" the letter said. ""For the next month, the Department stated the priority items requested, including the AAR team’s interview notes, ‘either belong to a third agency or implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests.’""

When committee staff stressed that the documents were critical to the House’s probe, State officials responded that the decision was above their ""paygrade,"" according to the letter.

BIDEN’S BOTCHED AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL HAUNTS 2024 ELECTION AS BOOK CLAIMS ‘13 AMERICANS NEVER HAD TO DIE’

""The Department’s stated reasons for withholding the interview notes are not rooted in law and, in fact, contravene Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority,"" McCaul wrote. ""It is appalling that over two years after the deadly and chaotic withdrawal, the Department continues to choose politics over policy.""

The Afghanistan AAR placed blame on both the Trump and Biden administrations for the disastrous withdrawal in August 2021.

It said, ""there was insufficient senior-level consideration of worst-case scenarios and how quickly those might follow.""

The report said President Biden’s decision to follow through with former President Donald Trump’s vow to withdraw troops from Afghanistan – and to set a Sept. 11 deadline for it – ultimately ""compounded the difficulties the Department faced in mitigating the loss of the military’s key enablers.""

It was also critical of the Biden administration’s decision to hand over control of Bagram Air Base to the Afghan government, a decision that also earned Biden bipartisan condemnation from national security hawks.

Please enter a valid email address.

A Manhattan jury in the civil corruption case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against the National Rifle Association (NRA) and its former CEO found the organization liable for financial mismanagement.

The jury determined Wayne LaPierre's violations of his duties cost the NRA $5,400,000, but he had already repaid roughly $1 million to the organization.

LaPierre was ordered to repay the group $4,351,231.

The New York jury said the NRA's CEO for three decades misspent millions of dollars of the group’s money on luxury personal purchases.

The decision came at the end of five days of deliberations.

NEW YORK AG OFFICE, EX-NRA OFFICIAL REACH SETTLEMENT DAYS BEFORE TRIAL AGAINST GUN ADVOCACY GROUP'S LEADERSHIP

James brought the lawsuit in 2020 and named the NRA, LaPierre, former CFO Wilson ""Woody"" Philips and general counsel John Frazer as defendants. The attorney general’s office argued the executives used millions in company funds on luxury personal purchases and trips, including hundreds of thousands of dollars on LaPierre’s trips to the Bahamas, according to the AG’s office.

The NRA, however, has long said the case was politically motivated by an attorney general who campaigned for the office by vowing to investigate and take on the group. James was elected to office in November 2018 and publicly slammed the NRA in the lead-up to her becoming New York’s chief law officer. While on the campaign trail, James called the group ""an organ of deadly propaganda"" and vowed to investigate whether the NRA could keep its charity status.

NEW YORK AG CASE AGAINST NRA LEADER FACES TRIAL AFTER COURT AGAIN REJECTS GUN GROUP'S CLAIM OF POLITICAL PROBE

""The NRA is an organ of deadly propaganda masquerading as a charity for public good,"" James wrote in a campaign press release in July 2018. ""Its agenda is set by gun-makers who think arming teachers is a better idea than making it harder for kids to get military grade guns.""

Weeks before her election, she described the NRA as ""a terrorist organization"" in comments to Ebony magazine and ""a criminal enterprise"" in remarks to local New York media.

In August 2020, she filed a dissolution lawsuit aiming to break up the NRA over alleged corruption. A New York Supreme Court justice ultimately blocked James’ effort to dissolve the organization in a 2022 decision, saying the suit did not meet the requirements of ordering a ""corporate death penalty"" on the group. The judge did allow the suit against the NRA’s top officials to proceed. James accused officials at the NRA of ""years of illegal self-dealing"" that provided a ""lavish lifestyle.""

WAYNE LAPIERRE ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION AS NRA CHIEF

At the trial, which began last month, LaPierre and the three other defendants were accused by Assistant Attorney General Monica Connell of getting caught ""with their hands in the cookie jar"" and argued the four were trying to deflect and downplay the use of the funds.

""They're going to try to get you to think about anything except what happened to those cookies,"" she said. ""They're going to blame anyone else but themselves.""

State attorneys argued during the trial that LaPierre spent roughly $11 million in NRA funds on private flights and about $500,000 on a handful of trips to the Bahamas, as well as ""appearing to dole out lucrative no-show contracts to former employees in order to buy their silence and continued loyalty.""

NEW YORK AG CASE AGAINST NRA LEADER FACES TRIAL AFTER COURT AGAIN REJECTS GUN GROUP'S CLAIM OF POLITICAL PROBE

LaPierre, who stepped down as NRA CEO and executive vice president last month after serving since 1991, said earlier in the trial he had made governance changes within the organization since 2021 and had paid about $300,000 back to the group. LaPierre’s attorney argued during the trial that the former NRA chief’s use of private flights was necessary for safety reasons due to his prominent national stature amid the acrimonious gun debate.

""This is a story made up by a person with an agenda that wanted him off the field,"" LaPierre’s attorney, Kent Correll, said Thursday in closing arguments.

""If this case was so important, why wouldn't she be here?"" he added, referring to James’ absence from the courtroom Thursday.

JUDGE ORDERS NEW YORK TO DOLE OUT NEARLY HALF A MILLION IN LEGAL FEES TO NRA AFTER SUPREME COURT VICTORY

The NRA’s legal team argued during the trial that the organization worked to address any potential corruption when such issues were first raised by internal complaints.

""When the fraud was discovered, it dug in. It turned over the rocks it was told not to overturn,"" attorney Sarah Rogers said. ""The NRA left no stone unturned.""

""If this was a case about corruption,""she added, ""it wasn't by the NRA.""

In a statement following the verdict, the NRA said the jury confirmed what ""they contended all along — that it was victimized by certain former vendors and ‘insiders’.""

NRA President Charles Cotton said that members should be ""heartened"" by the organization's ""commitment to best practices.""

""We appreciate the service of the jury and the opportunity to present evidence about the positive direction of the NRA today,"" Cotton said. ""NRA members should be heartened by the NRA’s commitment to best practices, and we will continue to amplify our compliance record in the pivotal next phase of these proceedings. To the extent there were control violations, they were acted upon immediately by the NRA Board beginning in summer 2018.""

NRA counsel William A. Brewer III maintained that the lawsuit was an ""unprecedented weaponization"" against the NRA to ""supress"" the organization.

""The NRA is eager to break the seal on facts surrounding an unprecedented weaponization of power against the NRA and its speech,"" Brewer said. ""There is little question former and current public officials were conspiring with Everytown and others to financially damage and politically suppress the NRA. Their actions harmed democracy and the rule of law – and letting relevant facts and documents remain secret does, too.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

""The compound is a clearly marked UN facility & its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" Lazzarini wrote on X.

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN LAYOFFS, VOWS TO REMAIN IN RACE: 'REALLY TOUGH DAY'

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.

Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was ""election interference"" and ""weaponization against a political opponent."" Trump said he was being punished for ""having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.""

Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father ""because there isn't any,"" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

AIR FORCE VET SEEN IN CAPITOL WITH ZIP TIES INTENDED 'TO TAKE HOSTAGES,' PROSECUTOR SAYS

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.""

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said.

Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.

SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY

Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.

NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,"" a spokesperson said. ""He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.""

Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.

GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered ""no"" when asked if ""undocumented immigrants"" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.

In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.

But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are ""inherently more unsafe.""

""It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.

""Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,"" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.

""But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,"" he said.

""And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,"" he said.

There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Please enter a valid email address.

The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.

The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a ""bump stock"" device is a ""machine gun"" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""

After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that ""bump stocks"" are machine guns.

The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.

GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several ""bump stocks"" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.

""It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,"" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.

But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.

The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.

""I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.""

Justice Samuel Alito called that ""disturbing.""

""These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.""

A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.

TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE

As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will ""bump"" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.

Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.

The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.

GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'

Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.

The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.

The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.

Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.

The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire ""automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""

Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.

""The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.""

After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, ""Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?""

But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.

""Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ""but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?""

The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.

""This is totally confusing,"" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.

""Now I'm completely lost,"" added Sotomayor at one point.

Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

""If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,"" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.

Supporters of the ban say it saves lives.

""Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,"" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. ""ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.""

A ruling is due by early summer.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had ""devastating consequences,"" and demands immediate action.

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

""Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,"" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. ""Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.""

They added, ""Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.""

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the ""invasion"" that led to Riley’s death.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

RAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.

Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.

Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.

Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.

The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.

The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was ""no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.""

Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.

Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.

Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state.

""She probably should drop out,"" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. ""I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.""

But Jodi said ""she should still stay in the race.""

""She's a better candidate than Trump,"" she added.

Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday.

""I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,"" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. ""I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.""

""I really don't know what she's doing,"" he continued. ""She's out of control.""

Similarly, Scott said, ""she needs to get out"" of the race. ""It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,"" he added.

KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT

Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman.

""She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do."" George said. ""If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.""

But Dan said he had ""no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.""

""She’s got no path to victory,"" he continued.

Theresa said: ""She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.""

Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination.

""I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.""

Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because ""we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.""

""I like Trump,"" he said. ""Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.""

But Josh said Haley's effort ""seems pointless.""

""It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,"" he told Fox News, ""which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came to the defense of former President Trump in a Wall Street Journal op-ed slamming the recent New York civil fraud court case that ordered the 45th president to pay a $354.8 million fine plus interest.

""Every American has a right to be critical of Mr. Trump’s politics—one of us ran against him in 2016,"" reads Bush’s op-ed, titled, ""Elon Musk and Donald Trump Cases Imperil the Rule of Law.""

""…But equality before the law is precious, and these rulings represent a crisis not only for the soundness of our courts, but for the business environment that has allowed the U.S. to prosper,"" the opinion piece continued. ""If these rulings stand, the damage could cascade through the economy, creating fear of arbitrary enforcement against entrepreneurs who seek public office or raise their voices as citizens in a way that politicians dislike.""

The column, which was co-authored by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, railed against the recent monthslong civil fraud trial against Trump, which resulted in a nearly $355 million fine and bars Trump from operating his business in New York for three years. The opinion piece also spoke out against how a Delaware judge recently rescinded tech billionaire Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation from Tesla.

Bush ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election, when the two exchanged repeated barbs, including personal jabs such as Trump claiming Bush is an ""embarrassment to his family."" In 2018, Bush said Trump is ""Republican in basically name only"" and took another apparent stab at the then-president, saying after he bowed out of the primary that he returned home where his children ""actually love me.""

Following Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, the former Florida governor said Trump ""provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol today.""

""He has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection,"" Bush said in a post at the time. ""Mr. President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy.""

TRUMP BACKS GEORGE P. BUSH, JEB'S SON, IN TEXAS POLITICAL RACE

The op-ed marks a defense of Bush's former 2016 rival, albeit not for Trump’s political stances. Instead, Lonsdale and Bush are calling for a ""dispassionate"" legal system that will not throttle businesses and lead to a weakened economy.

""​​New York and Delaware have played an outsize role in business in the U.S."" the pair wrote. ""Many major companies are incorporated in Delaware owing to the state’s body of corporate legal precedents; and a significant number of banks operate in New York, the world financial capital. The appellate courts in those states now have a chance to review these dangerous judicial rulings and try to stop further damage to the reputations of their respective judiciaries.""

""If they don’t, blue-state politicians may have the satisfaction of ‘sticking it’ to Messrs. Trump and Musk, but the loss to those states will be significant,"" they continued. ""The damage to the legal fabric of the country will be even worse. A dispassionate justice system is at the heart of American exceptionalism, and the country will be poorer if we lose it.""

Trump has since appealed the ruling and repeatedly argued that the presiding judge, Arthur Engoron, and New York Attorney General Letitia James were politically motivated in the case.

""A crooked New York judge working with the very corrupt attorney general of New York State, who ran on the basis of ‘I will get trump’ before knowing me — before even knowing anything about me — just ruled that I have to pay a fine of $355 million based on absolutely nothing,"" Trump told Fox News Digital after the fine was announced. ""No victims. No damages. Great financial statements, with full disclaimer clauses, only success.""

The op-ed noted that when James was on the campaign trail for the attorney general position, she ran on a campaign ""promise to target the man she called 'an illegitimate president.’""

""The unusual New York law Ms. James used to investigate and sue Mr. Trump didn’t require her to prove that he had intended to defraud anyone, or even that anyone lost money. The Associated Press found that of the 12 cases brought under that law since its adoption in 1956 in which significant penalties were imposed, the case against Mr. Trump was the only instance without an alleged victim or financial loss,"" the pair wrote.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.

While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November.

Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says ""the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.""

""I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,"" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'

Smith’s ""primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,"" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, ""there might not be a trial.""

Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a ""host"" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as ""motivated"" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall.

Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.

HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Manual states, ""Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.

""Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,"" Turley said.

John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.



""If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,"" Shu said. ""It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.

""The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.""

""This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,"" Shu added.

On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, ""Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.""

But, Turley said, ""the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.""

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

""The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,"" Turley said.

""The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection.

""So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.""

Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said ""the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.""

""But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,"" Trusty said.

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News,"Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.

In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.

Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.

When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.

The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.

That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.

ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT

As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.

Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.

TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.

Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.

""We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,"" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. ""The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.""

The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.

The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.

Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.

""If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,"" Kim said.

Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.

""I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,"" she said. ""I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.""

She added: ""Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.""

REPUBLICAN HOPES

The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.

Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.

GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES

Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.

Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send ""ticked off"" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.

A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.

""We’ll come together,"" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. ""The threat from Republicans is too much.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Mike Dunleavy has threatened to veto an education package overwhelmingly passed by lawmakers after a bruising debate, saying it lacks provisions he favors, including a pilot program offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers.

Dunleavy, a former educator, said this week that there is still time for lawmakers to address issues like the proposed bonuses and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting such schools. The governor has 15 days, excluding Sundays, to act on a bill sent to him if the Legislature is in session.

He can sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. A decision is expected by March 14.

ALASKA FACES TEACHER SHORTAGE AS EDUCATION FUNDING DEBATE DOMINATES LEGISLATURE

Some key lawmakers say the package was a compromise and question whether the state can afford the bonuses — or even if they would work.

Debate over education funding has dominated this legislative session. The House last week voted 38-2 to support a compromise package that included a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula; language encouraging districts to use some of the extra funding for teacher salary and retention bonuses; a state education department position dedicated to supporting charter schools and additional funding for K-3 students who need reading help. The vote followed a period of intense debate that also showed divisions within the Republican-led majority.

The Senate, led by a bipartisan coalition, agreed 18-1 on Monday to support the package, sending it to Dunleavy.

The compromise stemmed from negotiations after the House failed to support bringing up for debate a version of the bill that advanced from the House Rules Committee. That version included Dunleavy’s bonus plan, charter provisions and a roughly $80 million increase in state aid through the formula.

After the bill passed the House, Republican Speaker Cathy Tilton said that while the compromise ""fell short"" of the earlier proposal, ""I’d still call it a ‘qualified’ success.""

School officials had sought a roughly $360 million increase in funding, citing the impact of inflation and high energy and insurance costs. But the state, which relies heavily on oil and earnings from Alaska's nest-egg oil-wealth fund, has struggled with deficits over the last decade, and some lawmakers questioned whether that amount was realistic.

The Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million boost last year, but Dunleavy vetoed half that. Lawmakers did not have enough votes for an override.

Dunleavy has cast the bonuses and support of charter schools as a way of doing things differently. He has questioned whether simply increasing funding to districts will improve student performance.

He has proposed paying teachers bonuses of $5,000 to $15,000 a year over three years, with the highest amount for those in the most remote areas. Estimates suggest the program could cost about $55 million a year.

The language in the education package encouraging districts to use some of the funds for bonuses ""does not ensure the desired ends are realized,"" Dunleavy spokesperson Grant Robinson said by email Thursday.

Republican Senate President Gary Stevens told reporters this week that there is a limit to what the state can afford. A revised revenue forecast is expected by mid-March, and lawmakers haven't even begun publicly debating how big this year's dividend payout to residents from oil-wealth fund earnings should be — typically one of the most contentious debates of the session.

Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, raised questions about how well bonuses might work. He said he thinks there's a ""fair expectation"" that teachers from overseas or the Lower 48 would leave after the three years is up.

He said the level of support for the compromise bill was ""pretty unheard of these days"" for a controversial measure.

Tom Klaameyer, president of NEA-Alaska, a teachers' union, said if Dunleavy vetoes the education package, ""then our schools remain in crisis.""

The measure ""was simply a life preserver that was being thrown or could have been thrown to schools to stem the crisis,"" he said.

He added: ""We’re saying, throw the life preserver.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

CHINESE HACKERS HAD ACCESS TO US INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 'AT LEAST 5 YEARS' BEFORE DISCOVERY

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

The tax credit bill received bipartisan support, passing the chamber by a vote of 162-3. It provides a state income tax credit of up to $300 that could be used to pay for training and gun storage devices.

But Democrats decried the second bill banning the merchant code as a giveaway to the gun lobby that would make the state less safe.

STATE DEMS ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘BACKDOOR GUN TAX’ ON LAWFUL FIREARM OWNERS

Both bills now go to the state Senate for consideration.

Merchant category codes exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers. In 2022, Visa and other credit card companies said they would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, though they later put that decision on hold in the face of opposition from the gun lobby and conservative politicians.

There had been hope that categorizing credit and debit card purchases would allow authorities to potentially see red flags — like significant ammunition purchases — before a mass shooting could happen.

Republican state Rep. Jason Ridley, noting the ISO is based in Switzerland, said the code could be used to create a registry of gun sales.

""I don’t care which side of firearms you stand on,"" he said. ""Nobody should know what you’re buying and keeping a registry, especially a foreign country.""

""It’s what we’ve seen time and time again,"" she said. ""The gun lobby trumps everything.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY TAX BREAKS HURT AMERICA AND HELP CHINA

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

House managers serve as ""prosecutors"" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.

One impeachment manager told Fox they had been given ""no clear guidance"" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.

Fox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Fox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.

RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS

Several factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.

That said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.

Some House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.

A senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a ""comprehensive briefing"" last week and ""detailed"" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.

Despite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that ""we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.""

Some House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.

Fox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing ""mock trial"" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.

HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS

""We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,"" said one frustrated manager.

There has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.

Managers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned ""subject lanes"" to argue before the Senate.

One manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, is threatening to hold Secretary of State Antony Blinken in contempt of Congress, accusing him of failing to hand over key documents related to the U.S.’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

At the heart of the issue are interview notes that were used to put together the State Department’s After-Action Review (AAR) of the Afghanistan withdrawal.

""The Committee’s patience has been exhausted, and it requires these files to complete its investigation and make legislative recommendations for this Congress to consider,"" McCaul wrote.

""Should the Department fail to produce the… files outlined below by March 6, 2024, the Committee is prepared to hold you in contempt of Congress.""

'UNACCEPTABLE': TALIBAN DEMANDED TREATMENT 'SIMILAR TO RECOGNITION' TO ATTEND UN MEETING

He also accused Blinken of choosing ""politics over policy"" with the State Department’s decision to ""withhold"" the documents.

It’s notably harsh language for McCaul, whose relationship with Blinken is relatively more cordial than that of other House Republican committee chairs investigating the Biden administration.

In his letter, he noted multiple instances in which McCaul accused the department of stonewalling, including after he first requested notes from interviews with State officials taken by then-Ambassador Dan Smith, who led the AAR in September 2023.

He also listed ways in which the committee sought to accommodate the department. For example, McCaul wrote that the committee offered to redact names and address security concerns after State officials told him providing the notes would have a ""significant chilling effect on the Department’s ability to conduct thorough and impactful lessons learned efforts to improve our foreign policy-making.""

THINK THE US EXIT FROM AFGHANISTAN WAS BAD? LOOK WHAT'S BREWING IN THE PACIFIC

""On November 28, 2023, the Committee once more requested the interview notes, stating that the Department had failed to produce any high-priority items in its last eight productions,"" the letter said. ""For the next month, the Department stated the priority items requested, including the AAR team’s interview notes, ‘either belong to a third agency or implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests.’""

When committee staff stressed that the documents were critical to the House’s probe, State officials responded that the decision was above their ""paygrade,"" according to the letter.

BIDEN’S BOTCHED AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL HAUNTS 2024 ELECTION AS BOOK CLAIMS ‘13 AMERICANS NEVER HAD TO DIE’

""The Department’s stated reasons for withholding the interview notes are not rooted in law and, in fact, contravene Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority,"" McCaul wrote. ""It is appalling that over two years after the deadly and chaotic withdrawal, the Department continues to choose politics over policy.""

The Afghanistan AAR placed blame on both the Trump and Biden administrations for the disastrous withdrawal in August 2021.

It said, ""there was insufficient senior-level consideration of worst-case scenarios and how quickly those might follow.""

The report said President Biden’s decision to follow through with former President Donald Trump’s vow to withdraw troops from Afghanistan – and to set a Sept. 11 deadline for it – ultimately ""compounded the difficulties the Department faced in mitigating the loss of the military’s key enablers.""

It was also critical of the Biden administration’s decision to hand over control of Bagram Air Base to the Afghan government, a decision that also earned Biden bipartisan condemnation from national security hawks.

EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

The U.S. delivered its first air drop of aid supplies to Gaza on Saturday, with President Biden's administration saying it would be a ""sustained effort"" to bring more food and other aid.

The first of the airdrops landed in Gaza on Saturday, delivering some 38,000 MREs, or meals ready-to-eat. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says drops will continue throughout the coming weeks in partnership with Jordan and other allies.

""We need to do more and the United States will do more,"" Biden told reporters on Friday. ""Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough.""

The U.S. is also considering the delivery of aid by U.S. navy vessels in the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Gaza.

PALESTINIAN HUNGER CRISIS CONTINUES AS DESTROYED BAKERIES STRUGGLE TO REOPEN

The U.S. delivered the aid in a joint operation with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, according to a statement from CENTCOM.

Saturday's drop comes after more than 100 people were reported dead and hundreds more wounded when Palestinians rushing toward trucks loaded with humanitarian aid encountered fire in Gaza City early Thursday, according to local media reports.

The exact circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear; while several reports suggested Israeli troops fired on the crowd as they descended upon the trucks, the Israeli military suggested that most who died were trampled.

Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, said at least 104 people were killed and around 760 were wounded, describing the incident as a ""massacre.""

Israel has contested that description, however, saying the vast majority of those killed in the incident were trampled in the rush toward aid.

""Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip , Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered,"" Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling. The incident is under review.""

The IDF suggested that fewer than 10 civilians were injured by Israeli forces opening fire during the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Hamas says it holds Israel and Biden's administration ""fully responsible"" for the incident and for the ""ethnic cleansing"" of its people. The group called for worldwide demonstrations against Israel's bombardment of Gaza.

""We have mercy on the souls of our people’s martyrs, and we affirm that their sacrifices and blood will not be in vain and that we will remain loyal to our cause, our land, and our sanctities,"" the group posted to Telegram.

Please enter a valid email address.

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

""Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,"" the user added. ""If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

The former president began his remarks from the border Thursday afternoon by saying he spoke to the parents of Riley, who he described as ""an incredible young lady.""

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" he said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Trump's visit to the border coincided with President Biden's own trip to a different section of the border between Texas and Mexico. Biden did not mention Riley in his public remarks.

Trump detailed the brutal murder of 22-year-old nursing student Riley last week.

""A beautiful 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia was barbarically attacked. She was on a morning run… she was a beautiful young woman,"" he said. ""I spoke to her parents yesterday, they are incredible people. They are devastated beyond belief. She was so beautiful in so many ways.""

Trump said she was ""brutally assaulted, horrifically beaten, kidnaped, and savagely murdered.""

""The monster, the charge, charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump said, adding that he ""took the name from Hillary because she’s no longer relevant I guess.""

Trump, the 2024 GOP frontrunner, visited Eagle Pass, Texas, Thursday and toured Shelby Park with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and state officials. He also received a briefing and met with Texas officials, as well as Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council.

The former president and 2024 GOP frontrunner also met with Texas National Guard leadership.

Trump made remarks Thursday following the briefing and tour, slamming Biden for being ""incompetent,"" and for destroying the ""most secure border in history"" under his administration.

""I call him Crooked Joe because he's crooked and he's a terrible president, the worst president our country has ever had, probably the most incompetent president we've ever had,"" he continued. ""But it's allowing thousands and thousands of people to come in from China, Iran, Yemen, the Congo, Syria and a lot of other nations.""

Trump said many of those crossing are ""entire columns of fighting-aged men.""

Trump added that the border crisis ""is like a war… it’s a military operation.""

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

ICE CONFIRMS GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT ENTERED US ILLEGALLY, WAS PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED IN NYC

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, ICE confirmed he had been encountered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in August 2022, after entering near El Paso and was ""paroled and released for further processing.""

ICE also confirmed that Ibarra had been arrested by the New York Police Department a year later, on Sept. 14, 2023, and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation.""

When ICE learns that what it believes to be a removable illegal immigrant has been arrested on criminal charges, the agency will normally lodge a detainer — a request asking local law enforcement to keep the suspect in custody until they can be transferred to ICE and put into deportation proceedings.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER SUSPECT JOSE IBARRA LIVED WITHIN 5-MINUTE WALK OF UGA CRIME SCENE

In this case, however, ICE's statement says Ibarra was released before a detainer could be issued. NYC is also a ""sanctuary city,"" which generally restricts law enforcement from complying with ICE detainers.

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.

Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was ""election interference"" and ""weaponization against a political opponent."" Trump said he was being punished for ""having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.""

Former President Trump's campaign appealed a ruling from an Illinois judge that removed the 2024 presidential candidate from state ballots on Thursday.

The Trump campaign appeal contests Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter's ruling that Trump is disqualified from candidacy under the Constitutional ban on ""insurrectionists.""

Porter's ruling reversed last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter urged the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

The Trump campaign promised an appeal within hours of the ruling, and the order is currently on hold until litigation can be completed.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court battle will likely be rendered moot thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court taking up the same question in an upcoming case. In the case, the court will consider for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

The relevant section states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

Trump has not been charged with inciting an insurrection, but he does face allegations of election interference in Washington, D.C. and Georgia.

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

Last month, Lazzarini condemned Israel for allegedly striking an UNRWA facility in Gaza and killing nine people. Israel has denied responsibility for the attack.

""The compound is a clearly marked UN facility & its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" Lazzarini wrote on X.

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the ""invasion"" that led to Riley’s death.

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as ""belligerent.""

She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

Mike Dunleavy has threatened to veto an education package overwhelmingly passed by lawmakers after a bruising debate, saying it lacks provisions he favors, including a pilot program offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers.

Dunleavy, a former educator, said this week that there is still time for lawmakers to address issues like the proposed bonuses and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting such schools. The governor has 15 days, excluding Sundays, to act on a bill sent to him if the Legislature is in session.

He can sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. A decision is expected by March 14.

ALASKA FACES TEACHER SHORTAGE AS EDUCATION FUNDING DEBATE DOMINATES LEGISLATURE

Some key lawmakers say the package was a compromise and question whether the state can afford the bonuses — or even if they would work.

Debate over education funding has dominated this legislative session. The House last week voted 38-2 to support a compromise package that included a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula; language encouraging districts to use some of the extra funding for teacher salary and retention bonuses; a state education department position dedicated to supporting charter schools and additional funding for K-3 students who need reading help. The vote followed a period of intense debate that also showed divisions within the Republican-led majority.

The Senate, led by a bipartisan coalition, agreed 18-1 on Monday to support the package, sending it to Dunleavy.

The compromise stemmed from negotiations after the House failed to support bringing up for debate a version of the bill that advanced from the House Rules Committee. That version included Dunleavy’s bonus plan, charter provisions and a roughly $80 million increase in state aid through the formula.

After the bill passed the House, Republican Speaker Cathy Tilton said that while the compromise ""fell short"" of the earlier proposal, ""I’d still call it a ‘qualified’ success.""

School officials had sought a roughly $360 million increase in funding, citing the impact of inflation and high energy and insurance costs. But the state, which relies heavily on oil and earnings from Alaska's nest-egg oil-wealth fund, has struggled with deficits over the last decade, and some lawmakers questioned whether that amount was realistic.

The Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million boost last year, but Dunleavy vetoed half that. Lawmakers did not have enough votes for an override.

Dunleavy has cast the bonuses and support of charter schools as a way of doing things differently. He has questioned whether simply increasing funding to districts will improve student performance.

He has proposed paying teachers bonuses of $5,000 to $15,000 a year over three years, with the highest amount for those in the most remote areas. Estimates suggest the program could cost about $55 million a year.

The language in the education package encouraging districts to use some of the funds for bonuses ""does not ensure the desired ends are realized,"" Dunleavy spokesperson Grant Robinson said by email Thursday.

Republican Senate President Gary Stevens told reporters this week that there is a limit to what the state can afford. A revised revenue forecast is expected by mid-March, and lawmakers haven't even begun publicly debating how big this year's dividend payout to residents from oil-wealth fund earnings should be — typically one of the most contentious debates of the session.

Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, raised questions about how well bonuses might work. He said he thinks there's a ""fair expectation"" that teachers from overseas or the Lower 48 would leave after the three years is up.

He said the level of support for the compromise bill was ""pretty unheard of these days"" for a controversial measure.

Tom Klaameyer, president of NEA-Alaska, a teachers' union, said if Dunleavy vetoes the education package, ""then our schools remain in crisis.""

The measure ""was simply a life preserver that was being thrown or could have been thrown to schools to stem the crisis,"" he said.

He added: ""We’re saying, throw the life preserver.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

""We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election.

""If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,"" Haley said in the interview.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House.

""We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,"" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

""Do you think it started before she hired him?"" Merchant asked via text on Jan. 5, three days prior to filing the motion.

""Absolutely,"" Bradley replied.

But in court Tuesday, Bradley claimed he was ""speculating"" in those text message exchanges.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

Speaker Mike Johnson bucked the House GOP’s right flank to pass a short-term federal funding bill on Thursday, setting up Congress to avoid a partial government shutdown.

The bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), extends fiscal 2023’s government funding levels to two deadlines: March 8 and March 22. It passed the House, 320-99.

Majorities in both parties voted for the bill, although more Democrats than Republicans supported it – 113 GOP lawmakers voted for the CR while 97 voted against, and 207 Democrats voted for it versus just two who were opposed. In a modest win for Johnson, however, this CR got more GOP votes than the extension he put on the House floor in January, which got 107 Republicans' support.

Congress is currently operating under a CR passed in January that extended funding for some of its 12 appropriations bills to March 1 and others to March 8.

TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS FLEE CAPITOL HILL AMID RISING CHAOS, DIVISION: 'A BAD WORKPLACE'

House GOP leaders were forced to seek Democrat votes, which were likely anyway, to pass the bill. They fast-tracked it under suspension of the rules, meaning it forgoes the normal process of going through the House Rules Committee and a House-wide procedural vote in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.

It comes after GOP rebels weaponized procedural House votes several times to deliberately sink their own party’s legislation as a protest against leadership.

Many of those same rebels have pushed Johnson to allow for the government to shut down instead of extending the previous Democrat-controlled Congress’ funding levels. They argued that a shutdown, even a partial one, would give House Republicans leverage to push for conservative policies.

HOUSE GOP LEADERS JETTISON PROMISE TO VOTE ON 12 INDIVIDUAL SPENDING BILLS

With expected furloughs of federal employees and suspension of government programs, however, a government shutdown is a politically perilous outcome for both Republicans and Democrats.

This is the fourth CR the House has passed since fiscal 2023 ended on Sept. 30.

""We have to be willing to do what's difficult to save America. I'm not scared of a government shutdown if it's the price we need to pay to secure our border, get our debt under control and stop the government from going after my fellow Americans,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

But Johnson said during his weekly press conference that it would buy negotiators just enough time to release legislative text for their first six spending bills over the weekend while avoiding the negative effects of a partial shutdown.

""All of our members will have 72 hours to review it. That's our commitment. That's our rule. We're respecting it. And that's the only reason we need the process CR, to allow us time to do that,"" Johnson said.

""If I did it the way … [former House] Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi did, we just drop that bill and vote on it within hours. We're not going to do that.""

The CR must now pass the Senate and be signed by President Biden to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

CHINESE HACKERS HAD ACCESS TO US INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 'AT LEAST 5 YEARS' BEFORE DISCOVERY

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

More than 74,000 AT&T users reported outages to Downdetector as of 9:30 a.m. ET.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY TAX BREAKS HURT AMERICA AND HELP CHINA

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

The head of the union that represents Border Patrol agents across the country exploded on President Biden during a Thursday press conference, declaring agents were ""mad as hell,"" and ""p----d"" over his policies that allowed the situation at the border to deteriorate so badly.

National Border Patrol Council (NBCP) President Brandon Judd appeared alongside former President Donald Trump in Eagle Pass, Texas, which he described as the ""epicenter"" of the border crisis, as Biden held a dueling event a few hundred miles away at the less affected Brownsville, Texas.

""Sir, I want you to know your agents, my agents, they're mad as hell — absolutely mad that President Biden went to Brownsville, Texas, rather than going to Arizona, rather than going to San Diego, California, rather than coming to Eagle Pass, Texas, which has been the epicenter,"" Judd said after Trump invited him to the microphone to speak.

PROGRESSIVE HOUSE DEMS MADE SECRET ‘HUMAN RIGHTS’ TRIP TO CUBA AMID WORSENING BORDER CRISIS AT HOME

Judd said the trip allowed Trump to see how his policies worked compared to those implemented by the Biden administration, and that he had the clarity on how to expand them should he be elected president in November.

""Your agents … they are pissed. Border patrol agents are upset that we cannot get the proper policy that is necessary to protect human life, to protect American citizens, to protect the people that are crossing the border illegally,"" Judd said. ""We can't do that because President Biden's policies continue to invite people to cross here.""

""Thank goodness we have a governor like Governor Abbott. Thank goodness we have somebody that's willing to run for President of the United States, forego everything else he's been doing to serve the American people. Mr. President, thank you,"" he added.

Earlier in the day, the NBCP issued a fiery warning to Biden, telling him to ""keep our name out of your mouth,"" hours before the president was due to meet with officials at the border and urge passage of a Senate border bill.

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A Lubbock, Texas, federal judge ruled Tuesday that lawmakers unconstitutionally passed the $1.7 trillion government funding bill in 2022 when they did so under a pandemic-era rule allowing members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on the matter by proxy instead of in person.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, requested the courts block a provision of the funding bill that gave pregnant workers stronger legal protections.

U.S. District Judge Wesley Hendrix reviewed the request and issued a ""limited"" ruling on one of two provisions Paxton sought to have blocked.

Hendrix, appointed by former President Trump, ruled the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was wrongfully passed, blocking the law from being enforced against the state as an employer.

TEXAS AG KEN PAXTON SAYS STATE WON’T COMPLY WITH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ORDER TO REOPEN PARK TO FEDERAL AGENTS

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, enacted in December 2022, requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers.

In his ruling, Hendrix noted that his injunction is only applicable to state government employees.

Paxton filed a lawsuit last year, arguing the federal spending package was unconstitutionally passed because over half of the House of Representatives were not physically present to provide a quorum, yet they still voted by proxy.

EAGLE PASS MAYOR SAYS SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TEXAS, FEDS OVER BORDER CONTROL IS 'FRUSTRATING,' A 'CONSTANT STRUGGLE'

In May 2020, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, helped get a rule in place allowing lawmakers to vote by proxy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

When Republicans took control of the House in 2022, they ditched the proxy rule after challenging it in court unsuccessfully.

Hendrix said in a 120-page ruling that for over 200 years leading up to the voting proxy rule’s adoption, Congress understood that the majority of members of the House or Senate were required to be physically present to have a quorum to pass legislation, as stipulated under the Constitution’s quorum clause.

TEXAS AG PAXTON SUES NGO AIDING MIGRANTS, ACCUSES IT OF ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

""Supreme Court precedent has long held that the Quorum Clause requires presence, and the Clause’s text distinguishes those absent members from the quorum and provides a mechanism for obtaining a physical quorum by compelling absent members to attend,"" he wrote.

Paxton said Congress acted ""egregiously"" when it passed the $1.7 trillion funding bill.

""Congress acted egregiously by passing the largest spending bill in U.S. history with fewer than half the members of the House bothering to do their jobs, show up and vote in person,"" Paxton said. ""Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi abused proxy voting under the pretext of COVID-19 to pass this law, then Biden signed it, knowing they violated the Constitution. This was a stunning violation of the rule of law. I am relieved the court upheld the Constitution.""

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

Reuters reported that Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer Matthew Miller said the ruling ""correctly"" concluded a physical quorum was required to vote.

Hendrix also found in his ruling that Texas did not have standing to challenge $20 million appropriated in the bill to fund a pilot program providing case management and other services to noncitizens during immigration removal proceedings.

FIRST ON FOX — Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott slammed what he called a ""two-tiered standard"" concerning President Biden mulling executive action to handle the border crisis, and how former President Trump was treated during his presidency when he attempted to do the same thing.

""Well, there's no question that there's a two-tiered standard in our national media. The way they cover President Trump versus the way that they use kid gloves to cover Joe Biden. There's no question about that,"" Scott said during a Thursday interview with Fox News Digital when asked about reports that Biden is weighing executive action to crack down on asylum-seeking.

""More important, however, is that when we had President Trump in office, we actually had a basically sealed southern border. Crossings were around a thousand a day. Under President Biden in December, we had 10,000 crossings on average per day,"" he added. ""That contrast should be what the media is covering.""

TRUMP VP AUDITIONS: SCOTT RAMASWAMY HIT TRAIL IN SOUTH CAROLINA ON BEHALF OF FORMER PRESIDENT

An administration source told Fox earlier this week that Biden is considering executive action to restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum amid historic numbers of border crossings facing the country, but that it’s one of ""several"" plans being looked at.

An administration official also stressed that there have been no final decisions on what actions, if any, could be taken and that exploring policy options does not mean they will come to pass.

One of the options reportedly on the table is use of 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to restrict certain categories of foreigners who are deemed ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Trump attempted to use it but was blocked by a federal court, a ruling later upheld by the Supreme Court.

HISPANIC HOUSE DEMS ACCUSE BIDEN OF LEAVING THEM IN DARK ON POSSIBLE EXECUTIVE ACTION AT BORDER

The former president also faced sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the liberal media for attempting to use executive action on immigration, including being called ""xenophobic"" and ""racist.""

Biden has yet to face the same widespread level of criticism, although some of the more progressive Democrats have lashed out at the idea of Biden reverting to the previous administration's approach.

""Democrats CANNOT solve immigration problems by adopting Trump-like policies,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote in a post on X, while Rep. Jesús García, D-Ill., claimed, ""President Biden would be making a grave mistake if he moves forward with this policy.""

DEMOCRAT IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE UNDER FIRE FOR PAST AMNESTY, SANCTUARY CITY ‘SUPPORT’ AS BORDER CRISIS SPIRALS

The possible executive action by Biden comes just under two weeks after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border crisis.

During a gaggle with reporters after casting his vote in the South Carolina primary earlier in the day, Scott told Fox that he ""certainly"" supported Mayorkas' impeachment, and he praised the House for having the ""courage"" to take such action. However, he admitted the task likely wouldn't go anywhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

""The best way to eliminate Mayorkas being the secretary is to actually fire Joe Biden,"" he said. ""If we really want to change the trajectory of the country as it relates to immigration — illegal immigration — we have to do so by having someone, a commander-in-chief, who respects our borders, who wants to close our borders.""

Trump prosecutor Fani Willis' former lover at center of courtroom controversy  Fox News,"Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis set out to bring an unprecedented case against former president Donald Trump for interference in the 2020 election, but her allegedly ""improper"" affair with special prosecutor Nathan Wade is overshadowing her efforts, and could get her disqualified.

Wade was hired in 2022 to help prosecute the sweeping case against Trump and 18 other co-defendants on charges related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including racketeering, violating the oath of office, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, forgery and false statements.

Four co-defendants in the case alleged in subsequent court filings that Wade was romantically involved with Willis at the time he was hired and that she financially benefitted from his employment because of their relationship and lavish vacations they took together.

Co-defendants have also alleged that Wade’s ""lack of experience"" prosecuting complex cases makes him ""unqualified"" to work the case and questioned why Willis hired him in the first place.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

A John Marshall Law School graduate, Wade worked in private practice at his firm Wade & Campbell prior to his work with the Fulton County DA’s office.

""Whether you are in need of representation after a major car accident or are going through a change in your personal life that requires representation with a family law issue; whether you have a contract dispute, or whether you are involved in any type of civil litigation, Nathan J. Wade will be a zealous advocate for you,"" his firm’s website reads.

The New York Times reported that public records show ""scant evidence"" that he has prosecuted major criminal cases, with no evidence that he has handled a major political corruption case or one involving the state’s ""complicated racketeering statute"" under which all the defendants in the Trump case have been charged.

FANI WILLIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH WINK ON THE STAND, LABELS FORMER LOVER NATHAN WADE A 'SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN'

In 1999, Wade spent four months as an assistant solicitor in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County. From 2011 to 2021, he was an associate municipal court judge in Marietta, Georgia, handling misdemeanor cases.

Wade ran for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court three times between 2012 and 2016 but lost each time.

5 EXPLOSIVE MOMENTS FROM FANI WILLIS' HEATED TESTIMONY IN TRUMP FULTON COUNTY CASE: 'IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN …'

Wade took the stand on Thursday during a tense court hearing to hash out evidence to allegations that Willis had financially benefitted from Wade’s employment.

Both Willis and Wade testified that Wade had routinely paid for the trips and that Willis would reimburse him with cash. When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep six months of regular expenses on hand in cash.

Wade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that had been made in cash.

Wade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims.

""You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?"" Gillen asked.

""No, sir,"" Wade said.

""Not a single solitary one,"" Gillen pressed.



""Not a one.""

Willis, in her testimony, called Wade a ""southern gentleman."" Willis said her relationship with Wade ended roughly last summer but that the two remain ""very good friends"" and are ""probably closer than ever because of these attacks.""

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradict testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office. Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" the Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

Yeartie testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021, and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, to when she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie's testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie to be a friend.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the Global Times, touted President Biden and his campaign's use of TikTok, and critiqued the ""deep hypocrisy"" of America's politicians who call the social media platform a national security threat.

The opinion article in the CCP's state media said that Biden's campaign use of TikTok ""highlights the unjust suppression"" and ""proves the hype nonsense.""

""As a social media app that has been heavily portrayed by the US as a ‘national security threat,' TikTok being used by Biden's campaign highlights the unjust suppression of TikTok by American politicians and proves the hype nonsense,"" the article said.

BIG TECH FACES BRUTAL QUESTIONING ON CAPITOL HILL OVER CONTENT HARMING KIDS

The Global Times argued that the short-form video social media platform has become a ""necessary means"" for American politicians to reach young voters.

Citing a 2023 survey report by the Pew Research Center, the Global Times said that about one-third (32 percent) of young Americans aged 18 to 29 say they regularly get their news from TikTok.

The CCP newspaper said that American politicians are ""very self-contradictory when it comes to TikTok.""

The article argued that the Biden campaign's use of TikTok proves that the social media platform is not a national security threat and proves the ""deep hypocrisy"" of American politicians.

""In the end, we are witnessing that Washington's behavior toward TikTok is unacceptable to the public and society, so politicians have to choose to compromise for votes,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.

Jake Denton, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center, told Fox News Digital that Biden's ""hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats"" posed by TikTok.

President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America. — Jake Denton, Research Associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center

""Once again, President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America,"" Denton said. ""By choosing to use TikTok for his reelection campaign, he is callously disregarding warnings from both parties and national security experts that this Chinese-controlled technology imperils our national security through invasive data gathering and its ties to the CCP.""

""We cannot let one man’s thirst for social media virality and votes endanger our country,"" Denton said. ""The President must put America before his personal electoral interests, immediately delete TikTok, and join the bipartisan efforts to ban the app from operating on American soil.""

The Biden campaign's TikTok video sparked outrage after the administration banned the Chinese-owned app from federal devices over security concerns.

TIKTOK CEO GRILLED ON CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY INFLUENCE, SEARCHES OF TAYLOR SWIFT VS. TIANANMEN SQUARE

Last February, the administration set a 30-day deadline for government agencies to purge the app from federal devices.

The social media platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is popular among younger Americans.

Biden previously joined forces with TikTok influencers amid his re-election run, and the Democratic National Committee also joined the platform.

The president's campaign joining the Beijing-based social media platform could present unique security risks.

The LAO laid out the grim forecast in a Tuesday report that cautions that a $24 billion ""erosion in revenues"" corresponds to a $15 billion increase in the state's budget problem. Due to this, the budget deficit, which last month was estimated to hit $58 billion, could now go as high as $73 billion.

""The actual increase in the state's budget problem will depend on a number of factors, including formula-driven spending changes, most notably Proposition 98 spending requirements for schools and community colleges,"" the report said.

H.D. Palmer, the deputy director of California's Department of Finance and Newsom's spokesperson on budget matters, responded to the new LAO report by telling Fox News Digital that their budget shortfall differs from the $38 billion they estimate.

""From now through April, more than $51 billion in income and corporate tax receipts are forecast to come in,"" Palmer said. ""No one can say today with certainty how those numbers may change the budget estimate of a $38 billion shortfall.""

""A responsible step would be for the Legislature to act now on the early action budget measures needed for $8 billion in solutions to help close this gap,"" he added.

The projected bad news comes as Newsom has worked to increase his profile nationwide. It also occurred as California experienced a mass exodus.

California saw its first-ever population decline in 2020 when the state imposed rigid lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 2020 to July 2022, the state lost well over half a million people, with the number of residents leaving surpassing those moving in by almost 700,000.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.
