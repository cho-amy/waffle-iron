EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

Instances of antisemitism and Islamophobia have both risen in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, when militants entered the southern part of the country and slaughtered more than 1,200 people during a music festival.

Israel has responded with heavy shelling and a ground invasion of Gaza. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not delineate between fighters and civilians, has said that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed so far.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

""The compound is a clearly marked UN facility & its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" Lazzarini wrote on X.

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

""Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,"" the user added. ""If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

""I really appreciate community notes!"" added another.

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father ""because there isn't any,"" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.""

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said.

Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.

SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY

Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.

NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,"" a spokesperson said. ""He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.""

Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.

GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered ""no"" when asked if ""undocumented immigrants"" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.

In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.

But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are ""inherently more unsafe.""

""It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.

""Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,"" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.

""But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,"" he said.

""And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,"" he said.

There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Please enter a valid email address.

The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.

The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a ""bump stock"" device is a ""machine gun"" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""

After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that ""bump stocks"" are machine guns.

The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.

GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several ""bump stocks"" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.

""It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,"" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.

But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.

The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.

""I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.""

Justice Samuel Alito called that ""disturbing.""

""These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.""

A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.

TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE

As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will ""bump"" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.

Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.

The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.

GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'

Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.

The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.

The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.

Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.

The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire ""automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""

Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.

""The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.""

After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, ""Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?""

But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.

""Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ""but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?""

The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.

""This is totally confusing,"" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.

""Now I'm completely lost,"" added Sotomayor at one point.

Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

""If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,"" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.

Supporters of the ban say it saves lives.

""Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,"" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. ""ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.""

A ruling is due by early summer.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had ""devastating consequences,"" and demands immediate action.

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

""Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,"" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. ""Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.""

They added, ""Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.""

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

""We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election.

""If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,"" Haley said in the interview.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House.

""We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,"" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.

While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November.

Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says ""the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.""

""I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,"" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'

Smith’s ""primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,"" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, ""there might not be a trial.""

Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a ""host"" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as ""motivated"" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall.

Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.

HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Manual states, ""Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.

""Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,"" Turley said.

John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.



""If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,"" Shu said. ""It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.

""The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.""

""This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,"" Shu added.

On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, ""Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.""

But, Turley said, ""the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.""

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

""The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,"" Turley said.

""The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection.

""So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.""

Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said ""the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.""

""But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,"" Trusty said.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.

Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.

Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.

Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.

The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.

The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was ""no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.""

Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.

Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.

Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.

""I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,"" Austin said at the time. ""I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis.

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as ""belligerent.""

She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.

McAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it’s ""clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.""

Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state.

""She probably should drop out,"" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. ""I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.""

But Jodi said ""she should still stay in the race.""

""She's a better candidate than Trump,"" she added.

Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday.

""I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,"" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. ""I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.""

""I really don't know what she's doing,"" he continued. ""She's out of control.""

Similarly, Scott said, ""she needs to get out"" of the race. ""It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,"" he added.

KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT

Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman.

""She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do."" George said. ""If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.""

But Dan said he had ""no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.""

""She’s got no path to victory,"" he continued.

Theresa said: ""She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.""

Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination.

""I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.""

Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because ""we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.""

""I like Trump,"" he said. ""Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.""

But Josh said Haley's effort ""seems pointless.""

""It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,"" he told Fox News, ""which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came to the defense of former President Trump in a Wall Street Journal op-ed slamming the recent New York civil fraud court case that ordered the 45th president to pay a $354.8 million fine plus interest.

""Every American has a right to be critical of Mr. Trump’s politics—one of us ran against him in 2016,"" reads Bush’s op-ed, titled, ""Elon Musk and Donald Trump Cases Imperil the Rule of Law.""

""…But equality before the law is precious, and these rulings represent a crisis not only for the soundness of our courts, but for the business environment that has allowed the U.S. to prosper,"" the opinion piece continued. ""If these rulings stand, the damage could cascade through the economy, creating fear of arbitrary enforcement against entrepreneurs who seek public office or raise their voices as citizens in a way that politicians dislike.""

The column, which was co-authored by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, railed against the recent monthslong civil fraud trial against Trump, which resulted in a nearly $355 million fine and bars Trump from operating his business in New York for three years. The opinion piece also spoke out against how a Delaware judge recently rescinded tech billionaire Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation from Tesla.

TRUMP BLASTS 'CLUBHOUSE POLITICIAN' JUDGE AFTER BEING FINED $350M, DEFENDS THE 'GREAT COMPANY' HE BUILT

Bush ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election, when the two exchanged repeated barbs, including personal jabs such as Trump claiming Bush is an ""embarrassment to his family."" In 2018, Bush said Trump is ""Republican in basically name only"" and took another apparent stab at the then-president, saying after he bowed out of the primary that he returned home where his children ""actually love me.""

Following Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, the former Florida governor said Trump ""provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol today.""

""He has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection,"" Bush said in a post at the time. ""Mr. President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy.""

TRUMP BACKS GEORGE P. BUSH, JEB'S SON, IN TEXAS POLITICAL RACE

The op-ed marks a defense of Bush's former 2016 rival, albeit not for Trump’s political stances. Instead, Lonsdale and Bush are calling for a ""dispassionate"" legal system that will not throttle businesses and lead to a weakened economy.

""​​New York and Delaware have played an outsize role in business in the U.S."" the pair wrote. ""Many major companies are incorporated in Delaware owing to the state’s body of corporate legal precedents; and a significant number of banks operate in New York, the world financial capital. The appellate courts in those states now have a chance to review these dangerous judicial rulings and try to stop further damage to the reputations of their respective judiciaries.""

""If they don’t, blue-state politicians may have the satisfaction of ‘sticking it’ to Messrs. Trump and Musk, but the loss to those states will be significant,"" they continued. ""The damage to the legal fabric of the country will be even worse. A dispassionate justice system is at the heart of American exceptionalism, and the country will be poorer if we lose it.""

Trump has since appealed the ruling and repeatedly argued that the presiding judge, Arthur Engoron, and New York Attorney General Letitia James were politically motivated in the case.

FORMER TRUMP RIVAL JEB BUSH CALLS MANHATTAN GRAND JURY INDICTMENT 'VERY POLITICAL'

""A crooked New York judge working with the very corrupt attorney general of New York State, who ran on the basis of ‘I will get trump’ before knowing me — before even knowing anything about me — just ruled that I have to pay a fine of $355 million based on absolutely nothing,"" Trump told Fox News Digital after the fine was announced. ""No victims. No damages. Great financial statements, with full disclaimer clauses, only success.""

NEW YORK AG TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER TRUMP FRAUD RULING: 'JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED'

The op-ed noted that when James was on the campaign trail for the attorney general position, she ran on a campaign ""promise to target the man she called 'an illegitimate president.’""

""The unusual New York law Ms. James used to investigate and sue Mr. Trump didn’t require her to prove that he had intended to defraud anyone, or even that anyone lost money. The Associated Press found that of the 12 cases brought under that law since its adoption in 1956 in which significant penalties were imposed, the case against Mr. Trump was the only instance without an alleged victim or financial loss,"" the pair wrote.

Trump attorneys had asked Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an ""orderly post-judgement process,"" which was denied Thursday afternoon.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News,"Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.

In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.

Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.

When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.

The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.

That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.

ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT

As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.

Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.

TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.

Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.

""We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,"" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. ""The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.""

The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.

The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.

Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.

""If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,"" Kim said.

Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.

""I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,"" she said. ""I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.""

She added: ""Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.""

REPUBLICAN HOPES

The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.

Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.

GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES

Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.

Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send ""ticked off"" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.

A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.

""We’ll come together,"" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. ""The threat from Republicans is too much.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

""Do you think it started before she hired him?"" Merchant asked via text on Jan. 5, three days prior to filing the motion.

""Absolutely,"" Bradley replied.

But in court Tuesday, Bradley claimed he was ""speculating"" in those text message exchanges.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

The tax credit bill received bipartisan support, passing the chamber by a vote of 162-3. It provides a state income tax credit of up to $300 that could be used to pay for training and gun storage devices.

But Democrats decried the second bill banning the merchant code as a giveaway to the gun lobby that would make the state less safe.

STATE DEMS ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘BACKDOOR GUN TAX’ ON LAWFUL FIREARM OWNERS

Both bills now go to the state Senate for consideration.

Merchant category codes exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers. In 2022, Visa and other credit card companies said they would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, though they later put that decision on hold in the face of opposition from the gun lobby and conservative politicians.

There had been hope that categorizing credit and debit card purchases would allow authorities to potentially see red flags — like significant ammunition purchases — before a mass shooting could happen.

Republican state Rep. Jason Ridley, noting the ISO is based in Switzerland, said the code could be used to create a registry of gun sales.

""I don’t care which side of firearms you stand on,"" he said. ""Nobody should know what you’re buying and keeping a registry, especially a foreign country.""

Democratic state Rep. Shea Roberts said the legislation would take away a tool banks could use to detect fraud and law enforcement agencies could use to spot people stockpiling weapons for a possible mass shooting attack.

""It’s what we’ve seen time and time again,"" she said. ""The gun lobby trumps everything.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY TAX BREAKS HURT AMERICA AND HELP CHINA

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

House managers serve as ""prosecutors"" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.

One impeachment manager told Fox they had been given ""no clear guidance"" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.

Fox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Fox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.

RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS

Several factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.

That said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.

Some House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.

A senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a ""comprehensive briefing"" last week and ""detailed"" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.

Despite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that ""we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.""

Some House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.

Fox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing ""mock trial"" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.

HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS

""We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,"" said one frustrated manager.

There has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.

Managers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned ""subject lanes"" to argue before the Senate.

One manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, is threatening to hold Secretary of State Antony Blinken in contempt of Congress, accusing him of failing to hand over key documents related to the U.S.’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

At the heart of the issue are interview notes that were used to put together the State Department’s After-Action Review (AAR) of the Afghanistan withdrawal.

""The Committee’s patience has been exhausted, and it requires these files to complete its investigation and make legislative recommendations for this Congress to consider,"" McCaul wrote.

""Should the Department fail to produce the… files outlined below by March 6, 2024, the Committee is prepared to hold you in contempt of Congress.""

'UNACCEPTABLE': TALIBAN DEMANDED TREATMENT 'SIMILAR TO RECOGNITION' TO ATTEND UN MEETING

He also accused Blinken of choosing ""politics over policy"" with the State Department’s decision to ""withhold"" the documents.

It’s notably harsh language for McCaul, whose relationship with Blinken is relatively more cordial than that of other House Republican committee chairs investigating the Biden administration.

In his letter, he noted multiple instances in which McCaul accused the department of stonewalling, including after he first requested notes from interviews with State officials taken by then-Ambassador Dan Smith, who led the AAR in September 2023.

He also listed ways in which the committee sought to accommodate the department. For example, McCaul wrote that the committee offered to redact names and address security concerns after State officials told him providing the notes would have a ""significant chilling effect on the Department’s ability to conduct thorough and impactful lessons learned efforts to improve our foreign policy-making.""

THINK THE US EXIT FROM AFGHANISTAN WAS BAD? LOOK WHAT'S BREWING IN THE PACIFIC

""On November 28, 2023, the Committee once more requested the interview notes, stating that the Department had failed to produce any high-priority items in its last eight productions,"" the letter said. ""For the next month, the Department stated the priority items requested, including the AAR team’s interview notes, ‘either belong to a third agency or implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests.’""

When committee staff stressed that the documents were critical to the House’s probe, State officials responded that the decision was above their ""paygrade,"" according to the letter.

BIDEN’S BOTCHED AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL HAUNTS 2024 ELECTION AS BOOK CLAIMS ‘13 AMERICANS NEVER HAD TO DIE’

""The Department’s stated reasons for withholding the interview notes are not rooted in law and, in fact, contravene Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority,"" McCaul wrote. ""It is appalling that over two years after the deadly and chaotic withdrawal, the Department continues to choose politics over policy.""

The Afghanistan AAR placed blame on both the Trump and Biden administrations for the disastrous withdrawal in August 2021.

It said, ""there was insufficient senior-level consideration of worst-case scenarios and how quickly those might follow.""

The report said President Biden’s decision to follow through with former President Donald Trump’s vow to withdraw troops from Afghanistan – and to set a Sept. 11 deadline for it – ultimately ""compounded the difficulties the Department faced in mitigating the loss of the military’s key enablers.""

It was also critical of the Biden administration’s decision to hand over control of Bagram Air Base to the Afghan government, a decision that also earned Biden bipartisan condemnation from national security hawks.

Please enter a valid email address.

A Manhattan jury in the civil corruption case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against the National Rifle Association (NRA) and its former CEO found the organization liable for financial mismanagement.

The jury determined Wayne LaPierre's violations of his duties cost the NRA $5,400,000, but he had already repaid roughly $1 million to the organization.

LaPierre was ordered to repay the group $4,351,231.

The New York jury said the NRA's CEO for three decades misspent millions of dollars of the group’s money on luxury personal purchases.

The decision came at the end of five days of deliberations.

NEW YORK AG OFFICE, EX-NRA OFFICIAL REACH SETTLEMENT DAYS BEFORE TRIAL AGAINST GUN ADVOCACY GROUP'S LEADERSHIP

James brought the lawsuit in 2020 and named the NRA, LaPierre, former CFO Wilson ""Woody"" Philips and general counsel John Frazer as defendants. The attorney general’s office argued the executives used millions in company funds on luxury personal purchases and trips, including hundreds of thousands of dollars on LaPierre’s trips to the Bahamas, according to the AG’s office.

The NRA, however, has long said the case was politically motivated by an attorney general who campaigned for the office by vowing to investigate and take on the group. James was elected to office in November 2018 and publicly slammed the NRA in the lead-up to her becoming New York’s chief law officer. While on the campaign trail, James called the group ""an organ of deadly propaganda"" and vowed to investigate whether the NRA could keep its charity status.

NEW YORK AG CASE AGAINST NRA LEADER FACES TRIAL AFTER COURT AGAIN REJECTS GUN GROUP'S CLAIM OF POLITICAL PROBE

""The NRA is an organ of deadly propaganda masquerading as a charity for public good,"" James wrote in a campaign press release in July 2018. ""Its agenda is set by gun-makers who think arming teachers is a better idea than making it harder for kids to get military grade guns.""

Weeks before her election, she described the NRA as ""a terrorist organization"" in comments to Ebony magazine and ""a criminal enterprise"" in remarks to local New York media.

In August 2020, she filed a dissolution lawsuit aiming to break up the NRA over alleged corruption. A New York Supreme Court justice ultimately blocked James’ effort to dissolve the organization in a 2022 decision, saying the suit did not meet the requirements of ordering a ""corporate death penalty"" on the group. The judge did allow the suit against the NRA’s top officials to proceed. James accused officials at the NRA of ""years of illegal self-dealing"" that provided a ""lavish lifestyle.""

WAYNE LAPIERRE ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION AS NRA CHIEF

At the trial, which began last month, LaPierre and the three other defendants were accused by Assistant Attorney General Monica Connell of getting caught ""with their hands in the cookie jar"" and argued the four were trying to deflect and downplay the use of the funds.

""They're going to try to get you to think about anything except what happened to those cookies,"" she said. ""They're going to blame anyone else but themselves.""

State attorneys argued during the trial that LaPierre spent roughly $11 million in NRA funds on private flights and about $500,000 on a handful of trips to the Bahamas, as well as ""appearing to dole out lucrative no-show contracts to former employees in order to buy their silence and continued loyalty.""

NEW YORK AG CASE AGAINST NRA LEADER FACES TRIAL AFTER COURT AGAIN REJECTS GUN GROUP'S CLAIM OF POLITICAL PROBE

LaPierre, who stepped down as NRA CEO and executive vice president last month after serving since 1991, said earlier in the trial he had made governance changes within the organization since 2021 and had paid about $300,000 back to the group. LaPierre’s attorney argued during the trial that the former NRA chief’s use of private flights was necessary for safety reasons due to his prominent national stature amid the acrimonious gun debate.

""This is a story made up by a person with an agenda that wanted him off the field,"" LaPierre’s attorney, Kent Correll, said Thursday in closing arguments.

""If this case was so important, why wouldn't she be here?"" he added, referring to James’ absence from the courtroom Thursday.

JUDGE ORDERS NEW YORK TO DOLE OUT NEARLY HALF A MILLION IN LEGAL FEES TO NRA AFTER SUPREME COURT VICTORY

The NRA’s legal team argued during the trial that the organization worked to address any potential corruption when such issues were first raised by internal complaints.

""When the fraud was discovered, it dug in. It turned over the rocks it was told not to overturn,"" attorney Sarah Rogers said. ""The NRA left no stone unturned.""

""If this was a case about corruption,""she added, ""it wasn't by the NRA.""

In a statement following the verdict, the NRA said the jury confirmed what ""they contended all along — that it was victimized by certain former vendors and ‘insiders’.""

NRA President Charles Cotton said that members should be ""heartened"" by the organization's ""commitment to best practices.""

""We appreciate the service of the jury and the opportunity to present evidence about the positive direction of the NRA today,"" Cotton said. ""NRA members should be heartened by the NRA’s commitment to best practices, and we will continue to amplify our compliance record in the pivotal next phase of these proceedings. To the extent there were control violations, they were acted upon immediately by the NRA Board beginning in summer 2018.""

NRA counsel William A. Brewer III maintained that the lawsuit was an ""unprecedented weaponization"" against the NRA to ""supress"" the organization.

""The NRA is eager to break the seal on facts surrounding an unprecedented weaponization of power against the NRA and its speech,"" Brewer said. ""There is little question former and current public officials were conspiring with Everytown and others to financially damage and politically suppress the NRA. Their actions harmed democracy and the rule of law – and letting relevant facts and documents remain secret does, too.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

""The compound is a clearly marked UN facility & its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" Lazzarini wrote on X.

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN LAYOFFS, VOWS TO REMAIN IN RACE: 'REALLY TOUGH DAY'

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.

Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was ""election interference"" and ""weaponization against a political opponent."" Trump said he was being punished for ""having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.""

Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father ""because there isn't any,"" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

AIR FORCE VET SEEN IN CAPITOL WITH ZIP TIES INTENDED 'TO TAKE HOSTAGES,' PROSECUTOR SAYS

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.""

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said.

Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.

SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY

Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.

NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,"" a spokesperson said. ""He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.""

Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.

GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered ""no"" when asked if ""undocumented immigrants"" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.

In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.

But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are ""inherently more unsafe.""

""It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.

""Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,"" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.

""But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,"" he said.

""And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,"" he said.

There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Please enter a valid email address.

The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.

The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a ""bump stock"" device is a ""machine gun"" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""

After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that ""bump stocks"" are machine guns.

The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.

GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several ""bump stocks"" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.

""It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,"" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.

But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.

The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.

""I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.""

Justice Samuel Alito called that ""disturbing.""

""These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.""

A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.

TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE

As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will ""bump"" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.

Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.

The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.

GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'

Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.

The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.

The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.

Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.

The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire ""automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""

Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.

""The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.""

After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, ""Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?""

But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.

""Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ""but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?""

The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.

""This is totally confusing,"" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.

""Now I'm completely lost,"" added Sotomayor at one point.

Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

""If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,"" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.

Supporters of the ban say it saves lives.

""Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,"" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. ""ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.""

A ruling is due by early summer.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had ""devastating consequences,"" and demands immediate action.

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

""Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,"" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. ""Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.""

They added, ""Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.""

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the ""invasion"" that led to Riley’s death.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

RAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.

Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.

Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.

Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.

The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.

The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was ""no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.""

Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.

Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.

Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state.

""She probably should drop out,"" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. ""I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.""

But Jodi said ""she should still stay in the race.""

""She's a better candidate than Trump,"" she added.

Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday.

""I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,"" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. ""I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.""

""I really don't know what she's doing,"" he continued. ""She's out of control.""

Similarly, Scott said, ""she needs to get out"" of the race. ""It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,"" he added.

KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT

Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman.

""She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do."" George said. ""If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.""

But Dan said he had ""no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.""

""She’s got no path to victory,"" he continued.

Theresa said: ""She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.""

Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination.

""I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.""

Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because ""we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.""

""I like Trump,"" he said. ""Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.""

But Josh said Haley's effort ""seems pointless.""

""It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,"" he told Fox News, ""which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came to the defense of former President Trump in a Wall Street Journal op-ed slamming the recent New York civil fraud court case that ordered the 45th president to pay a $354.8 million fine plus interest.

""Every American has a right to be critical of Mr. Trump’s politics—one of us ran against him in 2016,"" reads Bush’s op-ed, titled, ""Elon Musk and Donald Trump Cases Imperil the Rule of Law.""

""…But equality before the law is precious, and these rulings represent a crisis not only for the soundness of our courts, but for the business environment that has allowed the U.S. to prosper,"" the opinion piece continued. ""If these rulings stand, the damage could cascade through the economy, creating fear of arbitrary enforcement against entrepreneurs who seek public office or raise their voices as citizens in a way that politicians dislike.""

The column, which was co-authored by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, railed against the recent monthslong civil fraud trial against Trump, which resulted in a nearly $355 million fine and bars Trump from operating his business in New York for three years. The opinion piece also spoke out against how a Delaware judge recently rescinded tech billionaire Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation from Tesla.

Bush ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election, when the two exchanged repeated barbs, including personal jabs such as Trump claiming Bush is an ""embarrassment to his family."" In 2018, Bush said Trump is ""Republican in basically name only"" and took another apparent stab at the then-president, saying after he bowed out of the primary that he returned home where his children ""actually love me.""

Following Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, the former Florida governor said Trump ""provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol today.""

""He has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection,"" Bush said in a post at the time. ""Mr. President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy.""

TRUMP BACKS GEORGE P. BUSH, JEB'S SON, IN TEXAS POLITICAL RACE

The op-ed marks a defense of Bush's former 2016 rival, albeit not for Trump’s political stances. Instead, Lonsdale and Bush are calling for a ""dispassionate"" legal system that will not throttle businesses and lead to a weakened economy.

""​​New York and Delaware have played an outsize role in business in the U.S."" the pair wrote. ""Many major companies are incorporated in Delaware owing to the state’s body of corporate legal precedents; and a significant number of banks operate in New York, the world financial capital. The appellate courts in those states now have a chance to review these dangerous judicial rulings and try to stop further damage to the reputations of their respective judiciaries.""

""If they don’t, blue-state politicians may have the satisfaction of ‘sticking it’ to Messrs. Trump and Musk, but the loss to those states will be significant,"" they continued. ""The damage to the legal fabric of the country will be even worse. A dispassionate justice system is at the heart of American exceptionalism, and the country will be poorer if we lose it.""

Trump has since appealed the ruling and repeatedly argued that the presiding judge, Arthur Engoron, and New York Attorney General Letitia James were politically motivated in the case.

""A crooked New York judge working with the very corrupt attorney general of New York State, who ran on the basis of ‘I will get trump’ before knowing me — before even knowing anything about me — just ruled that I have to pay a fine of $355 million based on absolutely nothing,"" Trump told Fox News Digital after the fine was announced. ""No victims. No damages. Great financial statements, with full disclaimer clauses, only success.""

The op-ed noted that when James was on the campaign trail for the attorney general position, she ran on a campaign ""promise to target the man she called 'an illegitimate president.’""

""The unusual New York law Ms. James used to investigate and sue Mr. Trump didn’t require her to prove that he had intended to defraud anyone, or even that anyone lost money. The Associated Press found that of the 12 cases brought under that law since its adoption in 1956 in which significant penalties were imposed, the case against Mr. Trump was the only instance without an alleged victim or financial loss,"" the pair wrote.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.

While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November.

Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says ""the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.""

""I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,"" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'

Smith’s ""primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,"" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, ""there might not be a trial.""

Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a ""host"" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as ""motivated"" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall.

Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.

HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Manual states, ""Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.

""Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,"" Turley said.

John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.



""If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,"" Shu said. ""It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.

""The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.""

""This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,"" Shu added.

On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, ""Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.""

But, Turley said, ""the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.""

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

""The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,"" Turley said.

""The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection.

""So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.""

Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said ""the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.""

""But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,"" Trusty said.

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News,"Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.

In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.

Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.

When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.

The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.

That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.

ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT

As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.

Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.

TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.

Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.

""We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,"" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. ""The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.""

The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.

The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.

Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.

""If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,"" Kim said.

Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.

""I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,"" she said. ""I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.""

She added: ""Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.""

REPUBLICAN HOPES

The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.

Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.

GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES

Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.

Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send ""ticked off"" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.

A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.

""We’ll come together,"" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. ""The threat from Republicans is too much.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Mike Dunleavy has threatened to veto an education package overwhelmingly passed by lawmakers after a bruising debate, saying it lacks provisions he favors, including a pilot program offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers.

Dunleavy, a former educator, said this week that there is still time for lawmakers to address issues like the proposed bonuses and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting such schools. The governor has 15 days, excluding Sundays, to act on a bill sent to him if the Legislature is in session.

He can sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. A decision is expected by March 14.

ALASKA FACES TEACHER SHORTAGE AS EDUCATION FUNDING DEBATE DOMINATES LEGISLATURE

Some key lawmakers say the package was a compromise and question whether the state can afford the bonuses — or even if they would work.

Debate over education funding has dominated this legislative session. The House last week voted 38-2 to support a compromise package that included a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula; language encouraging districts to use some of the extra funding for teacher salary and retention bonuses; a state education department position dedicated to supporting charter schools and additional funding for K-3 students who need reading help. The vote followed a period of intense debate that also showed divisions within the Republican-led majority.

The Senate, led by a bipartisan coalition, agreed 18-1 on Monday to support the package, sending it to Dunleavy.

The compromise stemmed from negotiations after the House failed to support bringing up for debate a version of the bill that advanced from the House Rules Committee. That version included Dunleavy’s bonus plan, charter provisions and a roughly $80 million increase in state aid through the formula.

After the bill passed the House, Republican Speaker Cathy Tilton said that while the compromise ""fell short"" of the earlier proposal, ""I’d still call it a ‘qualified’ success.""

School officials had sought a roughly $360 million increase in funding, citing the impact of inflation and high energy and insurance costs. But the state, which relies heavily on oil and earnings from Alaska's nest-egg oil-wealth fund, has struggled with deficits over the last decade, and some lawmakers questioned whether that amount was realistic.

The Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million boost last year, but Dunleavy vetoed half that. Lawmakers did not have enough votes for an override.

Dunleavy has cast the bonuses and support of charter schools as a way of doing things differently. He has questioned whether simply increasing funding to districts will improve student performance.

He has proposed paying teachers bonuses of $5,000 to $15,000 a year over three years, with the highest amount for those in the most remote areas. Estimates suggest the program could cost about $55 million a year.

The language in the education package encouraging districts to use some of the funds for bonuses ""does not ensure the desired ends are realized,"" Dunleavy spokesperson Grant Robinson said by email Thursday.

Republican Senate President Gary Stevens told reporters this week that there is a limit to what the state can afford. A revised revenue forecast is expected by mid-March, and lawmakers haven't even begun publicly debating how big this year's dividend payout to residents from oil-wealth fund earnings should be — typically one of the most contentious debates of the session.

Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, raised questions about how well bonuses might work. He said he thinks there's a ""fair expectation"" that teachers from overseas or the Lower 48 would leave after the three years is up.

He said the level of support for the compromise bill was ""pretty unheard of these days"" for a controversial measure.

Tom Klaameyer, president of NEA-Alaska, a teachers' union, said if Dunleavy vetoes the education package, ""then our schools remain in crisis.""

The measure ""was simply a life preserver that was being thrown or could have been thrown to schools to stem the crisis,"" he said.

He added: ""We’re saying, throw the life preserver.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

CHINESE HACKERS HAD ACCESS TO US INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 'AT LEAST 5 YEARS' BEFORE DISCOVERY

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

The tax credit bill received bipartisan support, passing the chamber by a vote of 162-3. It provides a state income tax credit of up to $300 that could be used to pay for training and gun storage devices.

But Democrats decried the second bill banning the merchant code as a giveaway to the gun lobby that would make the state less safe.

STATE DEMS ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘BACKDOOR GUN TAX’ ON LAWFUL FIREARM OWNERS

Both bills now go to the state Senate for consideration.

Merchant category codes exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers. In 2022, Visa and other credit card companies said they would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, though they later put that decision on hold in the face of opposition from the gun lobby and conservative politicians.

There had been hope that categorizing credit and debit card purchases would allow authorities to potentially see red flags — like significant ammunition purchases — before a mass shooting could happen.

Republican state Rep. Jason Ridley, noting the ISO is based in Switzerland, said the code could be used to create a registry of gun sales.

""I don’t care which side of firearms you stand on,"" he said. ""Nobody should know what you’re buying and keeping a registry, especially a foreign country.""

""It’s what we’ve seen time and time again,"" she said. ""The gun lobby trumps everything.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY TAX BREAKS HURT AMERICA AND HELP CHINA

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

House managers serve as ""prosecutors"" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.

One impeachment manager told Fox they had been given ""no clear guidance"" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.

Fox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Fox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.

RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS

Several factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.

That said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.

Some House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.

A senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a ""comprehensive briefing"" last week and ""detailed"" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.

Despite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that ""we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.""

Some House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.

Fox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing ""mock trial"" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.

HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS

""We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,"" said one frustrated manager.

There has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.

Managers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned ""subject lanes"" to argue before the Senate.

One manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, is threatening to hold Secretary of State Antony Blinken in contempt of Congress, accusing him of failing to hand over key documents related to the U.S.’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

At the heart of the issue are interview notes that were used to put together the State Department’s After-Action Review (AAR) of the Afghanistan withdrawal.

""The Committee’s patience has been exhausted, and it requires these files to complete its investigation and make legislative recommendations for this Congress to consider,"" McCaul wrote.

""Should the Department fail to produce the… files outlined below by March 6, 2024, the Committee is prepared to hold you in contempt of Congress.""

'UNACCEPTABLE': TALIBAN DEMANDED TREATMENT 'SIMILAR TO RECOGNITION' TO ATTEND UN MEETING

He also accused Blinken of choosing ""politics over policy"" with the State Department’s decision to ""withhold"" the documents.

It’s notably harsh language for McCaul, whose relationship with Blinken is relatively more cordial than that of other House Republican committee chairs investigating the Biden administration.

In his letter, he noted multiple instances in which McCaul accused the department of stonewalling, including after he first requested notes from interviews with State officials taken by then-Ambassador Dan Smith, who led the AAR in September 2023.

He also listed ways in which the committee sought to accommodate the department. For example, McCaul wrote that the committee offered to redact names and address security concerns after State officials told him providing the notes would have a ""significant chilling effect on the Department’s ability to conduct thorough and impactful lessons learned efforts to improve our foreign policy-making.""

THINK THE US EXIT FROM AFGHANISTAN WAS BAD? LOOK WHAT'S BREWING IN THE PACIFIC

""On November 28, 2023, the Committee once more requested the interview notes, stating that the Department had failed to produce any high-priority items in its last eight productions,"" the letter said. ""For the next month, the Department stated the priority items requested, including the AAR team’s interview notes, ‘either belong to a third agency or implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests.’""

When committee staff stressed that the documents were critical to the House’s probe, State officials responded that the decision was above their ""paygrade,"" according to the letter.

BIDEN’S BOTCHED AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL HAUNTS 2024 ELECTION AS BOOK CLAIMS ‘13 AMERICANS NEVER HAD TO DIE’

""The Department’s stated reasons for withholding the interview notes are not rooted in law and, in fact, contravene Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority,"" McCaul wrote. ""It is appalling that over two years after the deadly and chaotic withdrawal, the Department continues to choose politics over policy.""

The Afghanistan AAR placed blame on both the Trump and Biden administrations for the disastrous withdrawal in August 2021.

It said, ""there was insufficient senior-level consideration of worst-case scenarios and how quickly those might follow.""

The report said President Biden’s decision to follow through with former President Donald Trump’s vow to withdraw troops from Afghanistan – and to set a Sept. 11 deadline for it – ultimately ""compounded the difficulties the Department faced in mitigating the loss of the military’s key enablers.""

It was also critical of the Biden administration’s decision to hand over control of Bagram Air Base to the Afghan government, a decision that also earned Biden bipartisan condemnation from national security hawks.

EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

The U.S. delivered its first air drop of aid supplies to Gaza on Saturday, with President Biden's administration saying it would be a ""sustained effort"" to bring more food and other aid.

The first of the airdrops landed in Gaza on Saturday, delivering some 38,000 MREs, or meals ready-to-eat. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says drops will continue throughout the coming weeks in partnership with Jordan and other allies.

""We need to do more and the United States will do more,"" Biden told reporters on Friday. ""Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough.""

The U.S. is also considering the delivery of aid by U.S. navy vessels in the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Gaza.

PALESTINIAN HUNGER CRISIS CONTINUES AS DESTROYED BAKERIES STRUGGLE TO REOPEN

The U.S. delivered the aid in a joint operation with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, according to a statement from CENTCOM.

Saturday's drop comes after more than 100 people were reported dead and hundreds more wounded when Palestinians rushing toward trucks loaded with humanitarian aid encountered fire in Gaza City early Thursday, according to local media reports.

The exact circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear; while several reports suggested Israeli troops fired on the crowd as they descended upon the trucks, the Israeli military suggested that most who died were trampled.

Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, said at least 104 people were killed and around 760 were wounded, describing the incident as a ""massacre.""

Israel has contested that description, however, saying the vast majority of those killed in the incident were trampled in the rush toward aid.

""Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip , Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered,"" Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling. The incident is under review.""

The IDF suggested that fewer than 10 civilians were injured by Israeli forces opening fire during the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Hamas says it holds Israel and Biden's administration ""fully responsible"" for the incident and for the ""ethnic cleansing"" of its people. The group called for worldwide demonstrations against Israel's bombardment of Gaza.

""We have mercy on the souls of our people’s martyrs, and we affirm that their sacrifices and blood will not be in vain and that we will remain loyal to our cause, our land, and our sanctities,"" the group posted to Telegram.

Please enter a valid email address.

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

""Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,"" the user added. ""If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

The former president began his remarks from the border Thursday afternoon by saying he spoke to the parents of Riley, who he described as ""an incredible young lady.""

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" he said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Trump's visit to the border coincided with President Biden's own trip to a different section of the border between Texas and Mexico. Biden did not mention Riley in his public remarks.

Trump detailed the brutal murder of 22-year-old nursing student Riley last week.

""A beautiful 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia was barbarically attacked. She was on a morning run… she was a beautiful young woman,"" he said. ""I spoke to her parents yesterday, they are incredible people. They are devastated beyond belief. She was so beautiful in so many ways.""

Trump said she was ""brutally assaulted, horrifically beaten, kidnaped, and savagely murdered.""

""The monster, the charge, charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump said, adding that he ""took the name from Hillary because she’s no longer relevant I guess.""

Trump, the 2024 GOP frontrunner, visited Eagle Pass, Texas, Thursday and toured Shelby Park with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and state officials. He also received a briefing and met with Texas officials, as well as Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council.

The former president and 2024 GOP frontrunner also met with Texas National Guard leadership.

Trump made remarks Thursday following the briefing and tour, slamming Biden for being ""incompetent,"" and for destroying the ""most secure border in history"" under his administration.

""I call him Crooked Joe because he's crooked and he's a terrible president, the worst president our country has ever had, probably the most incompetent president we've ever had,"" he continued. ""But it's allowing thousands and thousands of people to come in from China, Iran, Yemen, the Congo, Syria and a lot of other nations.""

Trump said many of those crossing are ""entire columns of fighting-aged men.""

Trump added that the border crisis ""is like a war… it’s a military operation.""

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

ICE CONFIRMS GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT ENTERED US ILLEGALLY, WAS PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED IN NYC

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, ICE confirmed he had been encountered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in August 2022, after entering near El Paso and was ""paroled and released for further processing.""

ICE also confirmed that Ibarra had been arrested by the New York Police Department a year later, on Sept. 14, 2023, and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation.""

When ICE learns that what it believes to be a removable illegal immigrant has been arrested on criminal charges, the agency will normally lodge a detainer — a request asking local law enforcement to keep the suspect in custody until they can be transferred to ICE and put into deportation proceedings.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER SUSPECT JOSE IBARRA LIVED WITHIN 5-MINUTE WALK OF UGA CRIME SCENE

In this case, however, ICE's statement says Ibarra was released before a detainer could be issued. NYC is also a ""sanctuary city,"" which generally restricts law enforcement from complying with ICE detainers.

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.

Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was ""election interference"" and ""weaponization against a political opponent."" Trump said he was being punished for ""having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.""

Former President Trump's campaign appealed a ruling from an Illinois judge that removed the 2024 presidential candidate from state ballots on Thursday.

The Trump campaign appeal contests Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter's ruling that Trump is disqualified from candidacy under the Constitutional ban on ""insurrectionists.""

Porter's ruling reversed last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter urged the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

The Trump campaign promised an appeal within hours of the ruling, and the order is currently on hold until litigation can be completed.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court battle will likely be rendered moot thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court taking up the same question in an upcoming case. In the case, the court will consider for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

The relevant section states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

Trump has not been charged with inciting an insurrection, but he does face allegations of election interference in Washington, D.C. and Georgia.

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

Last month, Lazzarini condemned Israel for allegedly striking an UNRWA facility in Gaza and killing nine people. Israel has denied responsibility for the attack.

""The compound is a clearly marked UN facility & its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" Lazzarini wrote on X.

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the ""invasion"" that led to Riley’s death.

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as ""belligerent.""

She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

Mike Dunleavy has threatened to veto an education package overwhelmingly passed by lawmakers after a bruising debate, saying it lacks provisions he favors, including a pilot program offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers.

Dunleavy, a former educator, said this week that there is still time for lawmakers to address issues like the proposed bonuses and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting such schools. The governor has 15 days, excluding Sundays, to act on a bill sent to him if the Legislature is in session.

He can sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. A decision is expected by March 14.

ALASKA FACES TEACHER SHORTAGE AS EDUCATION FUNDING DEBATE DOMINATES LEGISLATURE

Some key lawmakers say the package was a compromise and question whether the state can afford the bonuses — or even if they would work.

Debate over education funding has dominated this legislative session. The House last week voted 38-2 to support a compromise package that included a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula; language encouraging districts to use some of the extra funding for teacher salary and retention bonuses; a state education department position dedicated to supporting charter schools and additional funding for K-3 students who need reading help. The vote followed a period of intense debate that also showed divisions within the Republican-led majority.

The Senate, led by a bipartisan coalition, agreed 18-1 on Monday to support the package, sending it to Dunleavy.

The compromise stemmed from negotiations after the House failed to support bringing up for debate a version of the bill that advanced from the House Rules Committee. That version included Dunleavy’s bonus plan, charter provisions and a roughly $80 million increase in state aid through the formula.

After the bill passed the House, Republican Speaker Cathy Tilton said that while the compromise ""fell short"" of the earlier proposal, ""I’d still call it a ‘qualified’ success.""

School officials had sought a roughly $360 million increase in funding, citing the impact of inflation and high energy and insurance costs. But the state, which relies heavily on oil and earnings from Alaska's nest-egg oil-wealth fund, has struggled with deficits over the last decade, and some lawmakers questioned whether that amount was realistic.

The Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million boost last year, but Dunleavy vetoed half that. Lawmakers did not have enough votes for an override.

Dunleavy has cast the bonuses and support of charter schools as a way of doing things differently. He has questioned whether simply increasing funding to districts will improve student performance.

He has proposed paying teachers bonuses of $5,000 to $15,000 a year over three years, with the highest amount for those in the most remote areas. Estimates suggest the program could cost about $55 million a year.

The language in the education package encouraging districts to use some of the funds for bonuses ""does not ensure the desired ends are realized,"" Dunleavy spokesperson Grant Robinson said by email Thursday.

Republican Senate President Gary Stevens told reporters this week that there is a limit to what the state can afford. A revised revenue forecast is expected by mid-March, and lawmakers haven't even begun publicly debating how big this year's dividend payout to residents from oil-wealth fund earnings should be — typically one of the most contentious debates of the session.

Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, raised questions about how well bonuses might work. He said he thinks there's a ""fair expectation"" that teachers from overseas or the Lower 48 would leave after the three years is up.

He said the level of support for the compromise bill was ""pretty unheard of these days"" for a controversial measure.

Tom Klaameyer, president of NEA-Alaska, a teachers' union, said if Dunleavy vetoes the education package, ""then our schools remain in crisis.""

The measure ""was simply a life preserver that was being thrown or could have been thrown to schools to stem the crisis,"" he said.

He added: ""We’re saying, throw the life preserver.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

""We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election.

""If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,"" Haley said in the interview.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House.

""We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,"" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

""Do you think it started before she hired him?"" Merchant asked via text on Jan. 5, three days prior to filing the motion.

""Absolutely,"" Bradley replied.

But in court Tuesday, Bradley claimed he was ""speculating"" in those text message exchanges.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

Speaker Mike Johnson bucked the House GOP’s right flank to pass a short-term federal funding bill on Thursday, setting up Congress to avoid a partial government shutdown.

The bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), extends fiscal 2023’s government funding levels to two deadlines: March 8 and March 22. It passed the House, 320-99.

Majorities in both parties voted for the bill, although more Democrats than Republicans supported it – 113 GOP lawmakers voted for the CR while 97 voted against, and 207 Democrats voted for it versus just two who were opposed. In a modest win for Johnson, however, this CR got more GOP votes than the extension he put on the House floor in January, which got 107 Republicans' support.

Congress is currently operating under a CR passed in January that extended funding for some of its 12 appropriations bills to March 1 and others to March 8.

TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS FLEE CAPITOL HILL AMID RISING CHAOS, DIVISION: 'A BAD WORKPLACE'

House GOP leaders were forced to seek Democrat votes, which were likely anyway, to pass the bill. They fast-tracked it under suspension of the rules, meaning it forgoes the normal process of going through the House Rules Committee and a House-wide procedural vote in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.

It comes after GOP rebels weaponized procedural House votes several times to deliberately sink their own party’s legislation as a protest against leadership.

Many of those same rebels have pushed Johnson to allow for the government to shut down instead of extending the previous Democrat-controlled Congress’ funding levels. They argued that a shutdown, even a partial one, would give House Republicans leverage to push for conservative policies.

HOUSE GOP LEADERS JETTISON PROMISE TO VOTE ON 12 INDIVIDUAL SPENDING BILLS

With expected furloughs of federal employees and suspension of government programs, however, a government shutdown is a politically perilous outcome for both Republicans and Democrats.

This is the fourth CR the House has passed since fiscal 2023 ended on Sept. 30.

""We have to be willing to do what's difficult to save America. I'm not scared of a government shutdown if it's the price we need to pay to secure our border, get our debt under control and stop the government from going after my fellow Americans,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

But Johnson said during his weekly press conference that it would buy negotiators just enough time to release legislative text for their first six spending bills over the weekend while avoiding the negative effects of a partial shutdown.

""All of our members will have 72 hours to review it. That's our commitment. That's our rule. We're respecting it. And that's the only reason we need the process CR, to allow us time to do that,"" Johnson said.

""If I did it the way … [former House] Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi did, we just drop that bill and vote on it within hours. We're not going to do that.""

The CR must now pass the Senate and be signed by President Biden to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

CHINESE HACKERS HAD ACCESS TO US INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 'AT LEAST 5 YEARS' BEFORE DISCOVERY

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

More than 74,000 AT&T users reported outages to Downdetector as of 9:30 a.m. ET.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY TAX BREAKS HURT AMERICA AND HELP CHINA

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

The head of the union that represents Border Patrol agents across the country exploded on President Biden during a Thursday press conference, declaring agents were ""mad as hell,"" and ""p----d"" over his policies that allowed the situation at the border to deteriorate so badly.

National Border Patrol Council (NBCP) President Brandon Judd appeared alongside former President Donald Trump in Eagle Pass, Texas, which he described as the ""epicenter"" of the border crisis, as Biden held a dueling event a few hundred miles away at the less affected Brownsville, Texas.

""Sir, I want you to know your agents, my agents, they're mad as hell — absolutely mad that President Biden went to Brownsville, Texas, rather than going to Arizona, rather than going to San Diego, California, rather than coming to Eagle Pass, Texas, which has been the epicenter,"" Judd said after Trump invited him to the microphone to speak.

PROGRESSIVE HOUSE DEMS MADE SECRET ‘HUMAN RIGHTS’ TRIP TO CUBA AMID WORSENING BORDER CRISIS AT HOME

Judd said the trip allowed Trump to see how his policies worked compared to those implemented by the Biden administration, and that he had the clarity on how to expand them should he be elected president in November.

""Your agents … they are pissed. Border patrol agents are upset that we cannot get the proper policy that is necessary to protect human life, to protect American citizens, to protect the people that are crossing the border illegally,"" Judd said. ""We can't do that because President Biden's policies continue to invite people to cross here.""

""Thank goodness we have a governor like Governor Abbott. Thank goodness we have somebody that's willing to run for President of the United States, forego everything else he's been doing to serve the American people. Mr. President, thank you,"" he added.

Earlier in the day, the NBCP issued a fiery warning to Biden, telling him to ""keep our name out of your mouth,"" hours before the president was due to meet with officials at the border and urge passage of a Senate border bill.

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A Lubbock, Texas, federal judge ruled Tuesday that lawmakers unconstitutionally passed the $1.7 trillion government funding bill in 2022 when they did so under a pandemic-era rule allowing members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on the matter by proxy instead of in person.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, requested the courts block a provision of the funding bill that gave pregnant workers stronger legal protections.

U.S. District Judge Wesley Hendrix reviewed the request and issued a ""limited"" ruling on one of two provisions Paxton sought to have blocked.

Hendrix, appointed by former President Trump, ruled the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was wrongfully passed, blocking the law from being enforced against the state as an employer.

TEXAS AG KEN PAXTON SAYS STATE WON’T COMPLY WITH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ORDER TO REOPEN PARK TO FEDERAL AGENTS

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, enacted in December 2022, requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers.

In his ruling, Hendrix noted that his injunction is only applicable to state government employees.

Paxton filed a lawsuit last year, arguing the federal spending package was unconstitutionally passed because over half of the House of Representatives were not physically present to provide a quorum, yet they still voted by proxy.

EAGLE PASS MAYOR SAYS SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TEXAS, FEDS OVER BORDER CONTROL IS 'FRUSTRATING,' A 'CONSTANT STRUGGLE'

In May 2020, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, helped get a rule in place allowing lawmakers to vote by proxy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

When Republicans took control of the House in 2022, they ditched the proxy rule after challenging it in court unsuccessfully.

Hendrix said in a 120-page ruling that for over 200 years leading up to the voting proxy rule’s adoption, Congress understood that the majority of members of the House or Senate were required to be physically present to have a quorum to pass legislation, as stipulated under the Constitution’s quorum clause.

TEXAS AG PAXTON SUES NGO AIDING MIGRANTS, ACCUSES IT OF ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

""Supreme Court precedent has long held that the Quorum Clause requires presence, and the Clause’s text distinguishes those absent members from the quorum and provides a mechanism for obtaining a physical quorum by compelling absent members to attend,"" he wrote.

Paxton said Congress acted ""egregiously"" when it passed the $1.7 trillion funding bill.

""Congress acted egregiously by passing the largest spending bill in U.S. history with fewer than half the members of the House bothering to do their jobs, show up and vote in person,"" Paxton said. ""Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi abused proxy voting under the pretext of COVID-19 to pass this law, then Biden signed it, knowing they violated the Constitution. This was a stunning violation of the rule of law. I am relieved the court upheld the Constitution.""

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

Reuters reported that Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer Matthew Miller said the ruling ""correctly"" concluded a physical quorum was required to vote.

Hendrix also found in his ruling that Texas did not have standing to challenge $20 million appropriated in the bill to fund a pilot program providing case management and other services to noncitizens during immigration removal proceedings.

FIRST ON FOX — Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott slammed what he called a ""two-tiered standard"" concerning President Biden mulling executive action to handle the border crisis, and how former President Trump was treated during his presidency when he attempted to do the same thing.

""Well, there's no question that there's a two-tiered standard in our national media. The way they cover President Trump versus the way that they use kid gloves to cover Joe Biden. There's no question about that,"" Scott said during a Thursday interview with Fox News Digital when asked about reports that Biden is weighing executive action to crack down on asylum-seeking.

""More important, however, is that when we had President Trump in office, we actually had a basically sealed southern border. Crossings were around a thousand a day. Under President Biden in December, we had 10,000 crossings on average per day,"" he added. ""That contrast should be what the media is covering.""

TRUMP VP AUDITIONS: SCOTT RAMASWAMY HIT TRAIL IN SOUTH CAROLINA ON BEHALF OF FORMER PRESIDENT

An administration source told Fox earlier this week that Biden is considering executive action to restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum amid historic numbers of border crossings facing the country, but that it’s one of ""several"" plans being looked at.

An administration official also stressed that there have been no final decisions on what actions, if any, could be taken and that exploring policy options does not mean they will come to pass.

One of the options reportedly on the table is use of 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to restrict certain categories of foreigners who are deemed ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Trump attempted to use it but was blocked by a federal court, a ruling later upheld by the Supreme Court.

HISPANIC HOUSE DEMS ACCUSE BIDEN OF LEAVING THEM IN DARK ON POSSIBLE EXECUTIVE ACTION AT BORDER

The former president also faced sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the liberal media for attempting to use executive action on immigration, including being called ""xenophobic"" and ""racist.""

Biden has yet to face the same widespread level of criticism, although some of the more progressive Democrats have lashed out at the idea of Biden reverting to the previous administration's approach.

""Democrats CANNOT solve immigration problems by adopting Trump-like policies,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote in a post on X, while Rep. Jesús García, D-Ill., claimed, ""President Biden would be making a grave mistake if he moves forward with this policy.""

DEMOCRAT IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE UNDER FIRE FOR PAST AMNESTY, SANCTUARY CITY ‘SUPPORT’ AS BORDER CRISIS SPIRALS

The possible executive action by Biden comes just under two weeks after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border crisis.

During a gaggle with reporters after casting his vote in the South Carolina primary earlier in the day, Scott told Fox that he ""certainly"" supported Mayorkas' impeachment, and he praised the House for having the ""courage"" to take such action. However, he admitted the task likely wouldn't go anywhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

""The best way to eliminate Mayorkas being the secretary is to actually fire Joe Biden,"" he said. ""If we really want to change the trajectory of the country as it relates to immigration — illegal immigration — we have to do so by having someone, a commander-in-chief, who respects our borders, who wants to close our borders.""

Trump prosecutor Fani Willis' former lover at center of courtroom controversy  Fox News,"Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis set out to bring an unprecedented case against former president Donald Trump for interference in the 2020 election, but her allegedly ""improper"" affair with special prosecutor Nathan Wade is overshadowing her efforts, and could get her disqualified.

Wade was hired in 2022 to help prosecute the sweeping case against Trump and 18 other co-defendants on charges related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including racketeering, violating the oath of office, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, forgery and false statements.

Four co-defendants in the case alleged in subsequent court filings that Wade was romantically involved with Willis at the time he was hired and that she financially benefitted from his employment because of their relationship and lavish vacations they took together.

Co-defendants have also alleged that Wade’s ""lack of experience"" prosecuting complex cases makes him ""unqualified"" to work the case and questioned why Willis hired him in the first place.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

A John Marshall Law School graduate, Wade worked in private practice at his firm Wade & Campbell prior to his work with the Fulton County DA’s office.

""Whether you are in need of representation after a major car accident or are going through a change in your personal life that requires representation with a family law issue; whether you have a contract dispute, or whether you are involved in any type of civil litigation, Nathan J. Wade will be a zealous advocate for you,"" his firm’s website reads.

The New York Times reported that public records show ""scant evidence"" that he has prosecuted major criminal cases, with no evidence that he has handled a major political corruption case or one involving the state’s ""complicated racketeering statute"" under which all the defendants in the Trump case have been charged.

FANI WILLIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH WINK ON THE STAND, LABELS FORMER LOVER NATHAN WADE A 'SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN'

In 1999, Wade spent four months as an assistant solicitor in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County. From 2011 to 2021, he was an associate municipal court judge in Marietta, Georgia, handling misdemeanor cases.

Wade ran for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court three times between 2012 and 2016 but lost each time.

5 EXPLOSIVE MOMENTS FROM FANI WILLIS' HEATED TESTIMONY IN TRUMP FULTON COUNTY CASE: 'IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN …'

Wade took the stand on Thursday during a tense court hearing to hash out evidence to allegations that Willis had financially benefitted from Wade’s employment.

Both Willis and Wade testified that Wade had routinely paid for the trips and that Willis would reimburse him with cash. When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep six months of regular expenses on hand in cash.

Wade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that had been made in cash.

Wade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims.

""You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?"" Gillen asked.

""No, sir,"" Wade said.

""Not a single solitary one,"" Gillen pressed.



""Not a one.""

Willis, in her testimony, called Wade a ""southern gentleman."" Willis said her relationship with Wade ended roughly last summer but that the two remain ""very good friends"" and are ""probably closer than ever because of these attacks.""

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradict testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office. Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" the Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

Yeartie testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021, and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, to when she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie's testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie to be a friend.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the Global Times, touted President Biden and his campaign's use of TikTok, and critiqued the ""deep hypocrisy"" of America's politicians who call the social media platform a national security threat.

The opinion article in the CCP's state media said that Biden's campaign use of TikTok ""highlights the unjust suppression"" and ""proves the hype nonsense.""

""As a social media app that has been heavily portrayed by the US as a ‘national security threat,' TikTok being used by Biden's campaign highlights the unjust suppression of TikTok by American politicians and proves the hype nonsense,"" the article said.

BIG TECH FACES BRUTAL QUESTIONING ON CAPITOL HILL OVER CONTENT HARMING KIDS

The Global Times argued that the short-form video social media platform has become a ""necessary means"" for American politicians to reach young voters.

Citing a 2023 survey report by the Pew Research Center, the Global Times said that about one-third (32 percent) of young Americans aged 18 to 29 say they regularly get their news from TikTok.

The CCP newspaper said that American politicians are ""very self-contradictory when it comes to TikTok.""

The article argued that the Biden campaign's use of TikTok proves that the social media platform is not a national security threat and proves the ""deep hypocrisy"" of American politicians.

""In the end, we are witnessing that Washington's behavior toward TikTok is unacceptable to the public and society, so politicians have to choose to compromise for votes,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.

Jake Denton, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center, told Fox News Digital that Biden's ""hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats"" posed by TikTok.

President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America. — Jake Denton, Research Associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center

""Once again, President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America,"" Denton said. ""By choosing to use TikTok for his reelection campaign, he is callously disregarding warnings from both parties and national security experts that this Chinese-controlled technology imperils our national security through invasive data gathering and its ties to the CCP.""

""We cannot let one man’s thirst for social media virality and votes endanger our country,"" Denton said. ""The President must put America before his personal electoral interests, immediately delete TikTok, and join the bipartisan efforts to ban the app from operating on American soil.""

The Biden campaign's TikTok video sparked outrage after the administration banned the Chinese-owned app from federal devices over security concerns.

TIKTOK CEO GRILLED ON CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY INFLUENCE, SEARCHES OF TAYLOR SWIFT VS. TIANANMEN SQUARE

Last February, the administration set a 30-day deadline for government agencies to purge the app from federal devices.

The social media platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is popular among younger Americans.

Biden previously joined forces with TikTok influencers amid his re-election run, and the Democratic National Committee also joined the platform.

The president's campaign joining the Beijing-based social media platform could present unique security risks.

The LAO laid out the grim forecast in a Tuesday report that cautions that a $24 billion ""erosion in revenues"" corresponds to a $15 billion increase in the state's budget problem. Due to this, the budget deficit, which last month was estimated to hit $58 billion, could now go as high as $73 billion.

""The actual increase in the state's budget problem will depend on a number of factors, including formula-driven spending changes, most notably Proposition 98 spending requirements for schools and community colleges,"" the report said.

H.D. Palmer, the deputy director of California's Department of Finance and Newsom's spokesperson on budget matters, responded to the new LAO report by telling Fox News Digital that their budget shortfall differs from the $38 billion they estimate.

""From now through April, more than $51 billion in income and corporate tax receipts are forecast to come in,"" Palmer said. ""No one can say today with certainty how those numbers may change the budget estimate of a $38 billion shortfall.""

""A responsible step would be for the Legislature to act now on the early action budget measures needed for $8 billion in solutions to help close this gap,"" he added.

California saw its first-ever population decline in 2020 when the state imposed rigid lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 2020 to July 2022, the state lost well over half a million people, with the number of residents leaving surpassing those moving in by almost 700,000.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

The U.S. delivered its first air drop of aid supplies to Gaza on Saturday, with President Biden's administration saying it would be a ""sustained effort"" to bring more food and other aid.

The first of the airdrops landed in Gaza on Saturday, delivering some 38,000 MREs, or meals ready-to-eat. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says drops will continue throughout the coming weeks in partnership with Jordan and other allies.

""We need to do more and the United States will do more,"" Biden told reporters on Friday. ""Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough.""

The U.S. is also considering the delivery of aid by U.S. navy vessels in the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Gaza.

PALESTINIAN HUNGER CRISIS CONTINUES AS DESTROYED BAKERIES STRUGGLE TO REOPEN

The U.S. delivered the aid in a joint operation with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, according to a statement from CENTCOM.

Saturday's drop comes after more than 100 people were reported dead and hundreds more wounded when Palestinians rushing toward trucks loaded with humanitarian aid encountered fire in Gaza City early Thursday, according to local media reports.

The exact circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear; while several reports suggested Israeli troops fired on the crowd as they descended upon the trucks, the Israeli military suggested that most who died were trampled.

Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, said at least 104 people were killed and around 760 were wounded, describing the incident as a ""massacre.""

Israel has contested that description, however, saying the vast majority of those killed in the incident were trampled in the rush toward aid.

""Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip , Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered,"" Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling. The incident is under review.""

The IDF suggested that fewer than 10 civilians were injured by Israeli forces opening fire during the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Hamas says it holds Israel and Biden's administration ""fully responsible"" for the incident and for the ""ethnic cleansing"" of its people. The group called for worldwide demonstrations against Israel's bombardment of Gaza.

Former President Trump attacked his Republican opponent Nikki Haley on Saturday, claiming that former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is ""a little bit"" smarter than her.

Trump addressed an enthusiastic crowd in Richmond, Virginia on Saturday night, days before the Super Tuesday votes are scheduled to take place.

Earlier on Saturday, Trump won the Idaho, Missouri, and Michigan Republican contests. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in the evening, the former president lamented about media coverage of his statements referring to President Biden as ""President Obama.""

Trump maintained that he refers to Biden as ""Obama"" intentionally. He also acknowledged that he has mixed up Haley, who he calls ""Birdbrain,"" with Pelosi.

""I purposely mix up a name, like Birdbrain… you know who Birdbrain is, right, Nikki, with Nancy Pelosi,"" he began.

""I put them in because they're interchangeable in my mind,"" Trump added. ""Except I have to say, I shouldn't say this about a semi-Republican, but I think Pelosi's probably a little bit smarter, actually.""

In January, Haley said that Trump was not ""mentally fit"" for office after he referred to Pelosi as Haley during a speech.

""Last night Trump is at a rally and he’s going on and on, mentioning me multiple times as to why I didn’t take security during the Capitol riots. Why I didn’t handle Jan. 6 better. I wasn’t even in D.C. on Jan. 6. I wasn’t in office then,"" Haley said during a January rally in Keene, New Hampshire.

""They’re saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he’s talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario.""

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

AIR FORCE VET SEEN IN CAPITOL WITH ZIP TIES INTENDED 'TO TAKE HOSTAGES,' PROSECUTOR SAYS

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

Rutgers University student Joe Gindi said a program coordinator at the New Jersey state school once ""screamed"" at Jewish students, ""F--- you. F--- you, colonizer. F--- you, Zionist.""

Instances of antisemitism and Islamophobia have both risen in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, when militants entered the southern part of the country and slaughtered more than 1,200 people during a music festival.

Israel has responded with heavy shelling and a ground invasion of Gaza. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not delineate between fighters and civilians, has said that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed so far.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

HALEY SAYS US WILL HAVE 'FEMALE PRESIDENT' — EITHER HERSELF OR KAMALA HARRIS

""Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,"" the user added. ""If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

One user responded: ""Vasu Abhiraman (left) is quite partisan, actually.""

""I really appreciate community notes!"" added another.

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

The former president began his remarks from the border Thursday afternoon by saying he spoke to the parents of Riley, who he described as ""an incredible young lady.""

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" he said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Trump's visit to the border coincided with President Biden's own trip to a different section of the border between Texas and Mexico. Biden did not mention Riley in his public remarks.

Trump detailed the brutal murder of 22-year-old nursing student Riley last week.

""A beautiful 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia was barbarically attacked. She was on a morning run… she was a beautiful young woman,"" he said. ""I spoke to her parents yesterday, they are incredible people. They are devastated beyond belief. She was so beautiful in so many ways.""

Trump said she was ""brutally assaulted, horrifically beaten, kidnaped, and savagely murdered.""

""The monster, the charge, charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump said, adding that he ""took the name from Hillary because she’s no longer relevant I guess.""

Trump, the 2024 GOP frontrunner, visited Eagle Pass, Texas, Thursday and toured Shelby Park with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and state officials. He also received a briefing and met with Texas officials, as well as Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council.

The former president and 2024 GOP frontrunner also met with Texas National Guard leadership.

Trump made remarks Thursday following the briefing and tour, slamming Biden for being ""incompetent,"" and for destroying the ""most secure border in history"" under his administration.

""I call him Crooked Joe because he's crooked and he's a terrible president, the worst president our country has ever had, probably the most incompetent president we've ever had,"" he continued. ""But it's allowing thousands and thousands of people to come in from China, Iran, Yemen, the Congo, Syria and a lot of other nations.""

Trump said many of those crossing are ""entire columns of fighting-aged men.""

Trump added that the border crisis ""is like a war… it’s a military operation.""

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

ICE CONFIRMS GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT ENTERED US ILLEGALLY, WAS PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED IN NYC

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, ICE confirmed he had been encountered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in August 2022, after entering near El Paso and was ""paroled and released for further processing.""

ICE also confirmed that Ibarra had been arrested by the New York Police Department a year later, on Sept. 14, 2023, and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation.""

When ICE learns that what it believes to be a removable illegal immigrant has been arrested on criminal charges, the agency will normally lodge a detainer — a request asking local law enforcement to keep the suspect in custody until they can be transferred to ICE and put into deportation proceedings.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER SUSPECT JOSE IBARRA LIVED WITHIN 5-MINUTE WALK OF UGA CRIME SCENE

In this case, however, ICE's statement says Ibarra was released before a detainer could be issued. NYC is also a ""sanctuary city,"" which generally restricts law enforcement from complying with ICE detainers.

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.

Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was ""election interference"" and ""weaponization against a political opponent."" Trump said he was being punished for ""having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.""

Former President Trump's campaign appealed a ruling from an Illinois judge that removed the 2024 presidential candidate from state ballots on Thursday.

The Trump campaign appeal contests Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter's ruling that Trump is disqualified from candidacy under the Constitutional ban on ""insurrectionists.""

Porter's ruling reversed last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter urged the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

The Trump campaign promised an appeal within hours of the ruling, and the order is currently on hold until litigation can be completed.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court battle will likely be rendered moot thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court taking up the same question in an upcoming case. In the case, the court will consider for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

The relevant section states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

Trump has not been charged with inciting an insurrection, but he does face allegations of election interference in Washington, D.C. and Georgia.

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

Former President Trump is leading President Biden in a new poll from the New York Times/Sienna College released Saturday, with voters saying they have little confidence in Biden's leadership.

The survey found that 43% of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 48% said they would vote for Trump. The poll further found that 47% of respondents ""strongly disapprove"" of Biden's handling of the presidency, in addition to 14% who said they ""somewhat disapprove.""

Just 17% stated that they ""strongly approve"" of Biden's handling of the job.

NYT and Sienna conducted the poll from Feb. 25-28, surveying 980 registered voters across the country. The poll was conducted in both English and Spanish using cellphones and landline telephones. It advertised a margin of error of 4%.

The poll further found that just one in four voters believe the country is headed in the right direction. And the number of Americans who believe Biden's policies have hurt them is double the number who believe they have helped, according to the Times.

With regard to the border, 50% of respondents said they would support restricting migrants' ability to apply for asylum, while just 43% said they would oppose the move.

The numbers were even worse for Biden when it comes to the economy, with 74% of Americans saying it is ""poor"" or ""only fair,"" compared to 26% who said the economy is doing ""good"" or ""excellent.""

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had ""devastating consequences,"" and demands immediate action.

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

""Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,"" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. ""Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.""

TRUMP BLAMES 'BIDEN'S BORDER INVASION' FOR LAKEN RILEY MURDER, VOWS 'LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION' IF ELECTED

They added, ""Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.""

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the ""invasion"" that led to Riley’s death.

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

RAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as ""belligerent.""

She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.

McAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it’s ""clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.""

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: 'LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

""We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election.

""If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,"" Haley said in the interview.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House.

""We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,"" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley blamed former President Trump Friday for recent Republican losses in critical electoral races, including those for seats in the Senate, while expressing hope the GOP's new leader in the upper chamber is focused on setting a tone rather than courting Trump.

""You're seeing the wave of what Congress thinks they need to do to win,"" Haley told reporters during a briefing at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood.

Haley was likely referencing Trump's dominance over the House and Senate relative to endorsements and influence.

But Haley suggested lawmakers who cater to the former president are misguided because Republicans have lost pivotal matchups since his presidency.

SENATE REPUBLICANS KEEP HOPE FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT ALIVE

""All of these losses happened after Donald Trump became president in 2016,"" she said, noting gubernatorial, federal and statewide losses in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia.

Haley claimed the only reason Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., was elected in 2021 was because ""he distanced himself"" from Trump.

Youngkin's political team declined to comment to Fox News Digital.

""It’s not an accurate statement,"" according to Zack Roday, a former Youngkin adviser and partner at Ascent Media.

DC PRIMARY REPRESENTS HALEY'S BEST CHANCE YET TO BEAT TRUMP

""Glenn Youngkin won because he built a movement and coalition of Republicans, independents and even Democrats who wanted a new direction for Virginia.""

Despite the losses, Haley claimed members of the House and Senate are now ""falling all over themselves to show that they're more Trump than everybody else.""

Haley weighed in on what the next Senate Republican leader should bring to the table after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's surprise announcement Wednesday that he's stepping down. She didn't suggest any specific senators for the role but explained she wants a leader focused on the people and ""not rewarding people for peacocking on TV.""

""I want to see somebody inspirational. I want to see somebody that says, ‘You know what, we can do things differently,'"" Haley said. ""My hope is that we will. But we'll have to see.""

Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital the campaign's focus is now on Biden and the general election.

""Republican voters have delivered resounding wins for President Trump in every single primary contest, and this race is over,"" she said.

Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father ""because there isn't any,"" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

""Do you think it started before she hired him?"" Merchant asked via text on Jan. 5, three days prior to filing the motion.

""Absolutely,"" Bradley replied.

But in court Tuesday, Bradley claimed he was ""speculating"" in those text message exchanges.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

Mike Dunleavy has threatened to veto an education package overwhelmingly passed by lawmakers after a bruising debate, saying it lacks provisions he favors, including a pilot program offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers.

Dunleavy, a former educator, said this week that there is still time for lawmakers to address issues like the proposed bonuses and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting such schools. The governor has 15 days, excluding Sundays, to act on a bill sent to him if the Legislature is in session.

He can sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. A decision is expected by March 14.

ALASKA FACES TEACHER SHORTAGE AS EDUCATION FUNDING DEBATE DOMINATES LEGISLATURE

Some key lawmakers say the package was a compromise and question whether the state can afford the bonuses — or even if they would work.

Debate over education funding has dominated this legislative session. The House last week voted 38-2 to support a compromise package that included a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula; language encouraging districts to use some of the extra funding for teacher salary and retention bonuses; a state education department position dedicated to supporting charter schools and additional funding for K-3 students who need reading help. The vote followed a period of intense debate that also showed divisions within the Republican-led majority.

The Senate, led by a bipartisan coalition, agreed 18-1 on Monday to support the package, sending it to Dunleavy.

The compromise stemmed from negotiations after the House failed to support bringing up for debate a version of the bill that advanced from the House Rules Committee. That version included Dunleavy’s bonus plan, charter provisions and a roughly $80 million increase in state aid through the formula.

After the bill passed the House, Republican Speaker Cathy Tilton said that while the compromise ""fell short"" of the earlier proposal, ""I’d still call it a ‘qualified’ success.""

School officials had sought a roughly $360 million increase in funding, citing the impact of inflation and high energy and insurance costs. But the state, which relies heavily on oil and earnings from Alaska's nest-egg oil-wealth fund, has struggled with deficits over the last decade, and some lawmakers questioned whether that amount was realistic.

The Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million boost last year, but Dunleavy vetoed half that. Lawmakers did not have enough votes for an override.

Dunleavy has cast the bonuses and support of charter schools as a way of doing things differently. He has questioned whether simply increasing funding to districts will improve student performance.

He has proposed paying teachers bonuses of $5,000 to $15,000 a year over three years, with the highest amount for those in the most remote areas. Estimates suggest the program could cost about $55 million a year.

The language in the education package encouraging districts to use some of the funds for bonuses ""does not ensure the desired ends are realized,"" Dunleavy spokesperson Grant Robinson said by email Thursday.

Republican Senate President Gary Stevens told reporters this week that there is a limit to what the state can afford. A revised revenue forecast is expected by mid-March, and lawmakers haven't even begun publicly debating how big this year's dividend payout to residents from oil-wealth fund earnings should be — typically one of the most contentious debates of the session.

Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, raised questions about how well bonuses might work. He said he thinks there's a ""fair expectation"" that teachers from overseas or the Lower 48 would leave after the three years is up.

He said the level of support for the compromise bill was ""pretty unheard of these days"" for a controversial measure.

Tom Klaameyer, president of NEA-Alaska, a teachers' union, said if Dunleavy vetoes the education package, ""then our schools remain in crisis.""

The measure ""was simply a life preserver that was being thrown or could have been thrown to schools to stem the crisis,"" he said.

He added: ""We’re saying, throw the life preserver.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Speaker Mike Johnson bucked the House GOP’s right flank to pass a short-term federal funding bill on Thursday, setting up Congress to avoid a partial government shutdown.

The bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), extends fiscal 2023’s government funding levels to two deadlines: March 8 and March 22. It passed the House, 320-99.

Majorities in both parties voted for the bill, although more Democrats than Republicans supported it – 113 GOP lawmakers voted for the CR while 97 voted against, and 207 Democrats voted for it versus just two who were opposed. In a modest win for Johnson, however, this CR got more GOP votes than the extension he put on the House floor in January, which got 107 Republicans' support.

Congress is currently operating under a CR passed in January that extended funding for some of its 12 appropriations bills to March 1 and others to March 8.

TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS FLEE CAPITOL HILL AMID RISING CHAOS, DIVISION: 'A BAD WORKPLACE'

House GOP leaders were forced to seek Democrat votes, which were likely anyway, to pass the bill. They fast-tracked it under suspension of the rules, meaning it forgoes the normal process of going through the House Rules Committee and a House-wide procedural vote in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.

It comes after GOP rebels weaponized procedural House votes several times to deliberately sink their own party’s legislation as a protest against leadership.

Many of those same rebels have pushed Johnson to allow for the government to shut down instead of extending the previous Democrat-controlled Congress’ funding levels. They argued that a shutdown, even a partial one, would give House Republicans leverage to push for conservative policies.

HOUSE GOP LEADERS JETTISON PROMISE TO VOTE ON 12 INDIVIDUAL SPENDING BILLS

With expected furloughs of federal employees and suspension of government programs, however, a government shutdown is a politically perilous outcome for both Republicans and Democrats.

This is the fourth CR the House has passed since fiscal 2023 ended on Sept. 30.

""We have to be willing to do what's difficult to save America. I'm not scared of a government shutdown if it's the price we need to pay to secure our border, get our debt under control and stop the government from going after my fellow Americans,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

But Johnson said during his weekly press conference that it would buy negotiators just enough time to release legislative text for their first six spending bills over the weekend while avoiding the negative effects of a partial shutdown.

""All of our members will have 72 hours to review it. That's our commitment. That's our rule. We're respecting it. And that's the only reason we need the process CR, to allow us time to do that,"" Johnson said.

""If I did it the way … [former House] Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi did, we just drop that bill and vote on it within hours. We're not going to do that.""

The CR must now pass the Senate and be signed by President Biden to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

CHINESE HACKERS HAD ACCESS TO US INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 'AT LEAST 5 YEARS' BEFORE DISCOVERY

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

The head of the union that represents Border Patrol agents across the country exploded on President Biden during a Thursday press conference, declaring agents were ""mad as hell,"" and ""p----d"" over his policies that allowed the situation at the border to deteriorate so badly.

National Border Patrol Council (NBCP) President Brandon Judd appeared alongside former President Donald Trump in Eagle Pass, Texas, which he described as the ""epicenter"" of the border crisis, as Biden held a dueling event a few hundred miles away at the less affected Brownsville, Texas.

""Sir, I want you to know your agents, my agents, they're mad as hell — absolutely mad that President Biden went to Brownsville, Texas, rather than going to Arizona, rather than going to San Diego, California, rather than coming to Eagle Pass, Texas, which has been the epicenter,"" Judd said after Trump invited him to the microphone to speak.

Judd said the trip allowed Trump to see how his policies worked compared to those implemented by the Biden administration, and that he had the clarity on how to expand them should he be elected president in November.

""Your agents … they are pissed. Border patrol agents are upset that we cannot get the proper policy that is necessary to protect human life, to protect American citizens, to protect the people that are crossing the border illegally,"" Judd said. ""We can't do that because President Biden's policies continue to invite people to cross here.""

""Thank goodness we have a governor like Governor Abbott. Thank goodness we have somebody that's willing to run for President of the United States, forego everything else he's been doing to serve the American people. Mr. President, thank you,"" he added.

President Biden signed a funding measure on Friday that was agreed upon by congressional leaders and passed in both the House and Senate, once again averting a government shutdown.

Biden signed H.R. 7463, a funding bill titled ""Extension of Continuing Appropriations and Other Matters Act, 2024,"" which extends the March 1 funding deadline for the first slate of appropriations bills by one week, pushing it to March 8.

Those bills will head to the House and Senate for votes in the next week.

The funding bill also moves the second deadline for a second slate of bills to March 22.

However, the second group of appropriations measures still need to be finalized and agreed upon before heading to the floor for votes.

""We are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Wednesday, along with House Appropriations Committee Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine.

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A Lubbock, Texas, federal judge ruled Tuesday that lawmakers unconstitutionally passed the $1.7 trillion government funding bill in 2022 when they did so under a pandemic-era rule allowing members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on the matter by proxy instead of in person.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, requested the courts block a provision of the funding bill that gave pregnant workers stronger legal protections.

U.S. District Judge Wesley Hendrix reviewed the request and issued a ""limited"" ruling on one of two provisions Paxton sought to have blocked.

Hendrix, appointed by former President Trump, ruled the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was wrongfully passed, blocking the law from being enforced against the state as an employer.

TEXAS AG KEN PAXTON SAYS STATE WON’T COMPLY WITH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ORDER TO REOPEN PARK TO FEDERAL AGENTS

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, enacted in December 2022, requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers.

In his ruling, Hendrix noted that his injunction is only applicable to state government employees.

Paxton filed a lawsuit last year, arguing the federal spending package was unconstitutionally passed because over half of the House of Representatives were not physically present to provide a quorum, yet they still voted by proxy.

EAGLE PASS MAYOR SAYS SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TEXAS, FEDS OVER BORDER CONTROL IS 'FRUSTRATING,' A 'CONSTANT STRUGGLE'

In May 2020, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, helped get a rule in place allowing lawmakers to vote by proxy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

When Republicans took control of the House in 2022, they ditched the proxy rule after challenging it in court unsuccessfully.

Hendrix said in a 120-page ruling that for over 200 years leading up to the voting proxy rule’s adoption, Congress understood that the majority of members of the House or Senate were required to be physically present to have a quorum to pass legislation, as stipulated under the Constitution’s quorum clause.

TEXAS AG PAXTON SUES NGO AIDING MIGRANTS, ACCUSES IT OF ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

""Supreme Court precedent has long held that the Quorum Clause requires presence, and the Clause’s text distinguishes those absent members from the quorum and provides a mechanism for obtaining a physical quorum by compelling absent members to attend,"" he wrote.

Paxton said Congress acted ""egregiously"" when it passed the $1.7 trillion funding bill.

""Congress acted egregiously by passing the largest spending bill in U.S. history with fewer than half the members of the House bothering to do their jobs, show up and vote in person,"" Paxton said. ""Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi abused proxy voting under the pretext of COVID-19 to pass this law, then Biden signed it, knowing they violated the Constitution. This was a stunning violation of the rule of law. I am relieved the court upheld the Constitution.""

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

Reuters reported that Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer Matthew Miller said the ruling ""correctly"" concluded a physical quorum was required to vote.

Hendrix also found in his ruling that Texas did not have standing to challenge $20 million appropriated in the bill to fund a pilot program providing case management and other services to noncitizens during immigration removal proceedings.

FIRST ON FOX — Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott slammed what he called a ""two-tiered standard"" concerning President Biden mulling executive action to handle the border crisis, and how former President Trump was treated during his presidency when he attempted to do the same thing.

""Well, there's no question that there's a two-tiered standard in our national media. The way they cover President Trump versus the way that they use kid gloves to cover Joe Biden. There's no question about that,"" Scott said during a Thursday interview with Fox News Digital when asked about reports that Biden is weighing executive action to crack down on asylum-seeking.

""More important, however, is that when we had President Trump in office, we actually had a basically sealed southern border. Crossings were around a thousand a day. Under President Biden in December, we had 10,000 crossings on average per day,"" he added. ""That contrast should be what the media is covering.""

TRUMP VP AUDITIONS: SCOTT RAMASWAMY HIT TRAIL IN SOUTH CAROLINA ON BEHALF OF FORMER PRESIDENT

An administration source told Fox earlier this week that Biden is considering executive action to restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum amid historic numbers of border crossings facing the country, but that it’s one of ""several"" plans being looked at.

An administration official also stressed that there have been no final decisions on what actions, if any, could be taken and that exploring policy options does not mean they will come to pass.

One of the options reportedly on the table is use of 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to restrict certain categories of foreigners who are deemed ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Trump attempted to use it but was blocked by a federal court, a ruling later upheld by the Supreme Court.

HISPANIC HOUSE DEMS ACCUSE BIDEN OF LEAVING THEM IN DARK ON POSSIBLE EXECUTIVE ACTION AT BORDER

The former president also faced sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the liberal media for attempting to use executive action on immigration, including being called ""xenophobic"" and ""racist.""

Biden has yet to face the same widespread level of criticism, although some of the more progressive Democrats have lashed out at the idea of Biden reverting to the previous administration's approach.

""Democrats CANNOT solve immigration problems by adopting Trump-like policies,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote in a post on X, while Rep. Jesús García, D-Ill., claimed, ""President Biden would be making a grave mistake if he moves forward with this policy.""

DEMOCRAT IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE UNDER FIRE FOR PAST AMNESTY, SANCTUARY CITY ‘SUPPORT’ AS BORDER CRISIS SPIRALS

The possible executive action by Biden comes just under two weeks after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border crisis.

During a gaggle with reporters after casting his vote in the South Carolina primary earlier in the day, Scott told Fox that he ""certainly"" supported Mayorkas' impeachment, and he praised the House for having the ""courage"" to take such action. However, he admitted the task likely wouldn't go anywhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

""The best way to eliminate Mayorkas being the secretary is to actually fire Joe Biden,"" he said. ""If we really want to change the trajectory of the country as it relates to immigration — illegal immigration — we have to do so by having someone, a commander-in-chief, who respects our borders, who wants to close our borders.""

Wade was hired in 2022 to help prosecute the sweeping case against Trump and 18 other co-defendants on charges related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including racketeering, violating the oath of office, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, forgery and false statements.

Four co-defendants in the case alleged in subsequent court filings that Wade was romantically involved with Willis at the time he was hired and that she financially benefitted from his employment because of their relationship and lavish vacations they took together.

Co-defendants have also alleged that Wade’s ""lack of experience"" prosecuting complex cases makes him ""unqualified"" to work the case and questioned why Willis hired him in the first place.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

A John Marshall Law School graduate, Wade worked in private practice at his firm Wade & Campbell prior to his work with the Fulton County DA’s office.

""Whether you are in need of representation after a major car accident or are going through a change in your personal life that requires representation with a family law issue; whether you have a contract dispute, or whether you are involved in any type of civil litigation, Nathan J. Wade will be a zealous advocate for you,"" his firm’s website reads.

The New York Times reported that public records show ""scant evidence"" that he has prosecuted major criminal cases, with no evidence that he has handled a major political corruption case or one involving the state’s ""complicated racketeering statute"" under which all the defendants in the Trump case have been charged.

FANI WILLIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH WINK ON THE STAND, LABELS FORMER LOVER NATHAN WADE A 'SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN'

In 1999, Wade spent four months as an assistant solicitor in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County. From 2011 to 2021, he was an associate municipal court judge in Marietta, Georgia, handling misdemeanor cases.

Wade ran for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court three times between 2012 and 2016 but lost each time.

5 EXPLOSIVE MOMENTS FROM FANI WILLIS' HEATED TESTIMONY IN TRUMP FULTON COUNTY CASE: 'IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN …'

Wade took the stand on Thursday during a tense court hearing to hash out evidence to allegations that Willis had financially benefitted from Wade’s employment.

Both Willis and Wade testified that Wade had routinely paid for the trips and that Willis would reimburse him with cash. When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep six months of regular expenses on hand in cash.

Wade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that had been made in cash.

Wade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims.

""You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?"" Gillen asked.

""No, sir,"" Wade said.

""Not a single solitary one,"" Gillen pressed.



""Not a one.""

Willis, in her testimony, called Wade a ""southern gentleman."" Willis said her relationship with Wade ended roughly last summer but that the two remain ""very good friends"" and are ""probably closer than ever because of these attacks.""

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradict testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office. Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" the Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

Yeartie testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021, and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, to when she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie's testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie to be a friend.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A transgender lawmaker stormed out of the Virginia Senate chamber in protest after Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears referred to the lawmaker as ""sir"" on Monday.

Sen. Danica Roem, a Democrat and the first transgender person to serve in the Virginia legislature, is biologically male but identifies as a woman. Roem asked a question about a piece of legislation during a general session on Monday afternoon.

""Madam President, how many votes would it take to pass this bill with the emergency clause?"" Roem asked.

""That would be four-fifths, Senator,"" Sears responded.

""And what would be the exact number of that, Madam President?"" Roem asked again.

""Yes, sir, that would be 32,"" Sears said.

Roem could then be heard putting down the microphone and leaving the chamber. The lawmaker did not cast a vote in the roll call vote moments later.

Sears offered an apology for the incident later in the session, though she did not specifically apologize for referring to Roem by the lawmaker's biological gender.

""I upset Sen. Roem,"" Sears said. ""Let it be known I am not here to upset anyone. I am here to do the job the people of Virginia have called me to do, and that is to treat everyone with respect and dignity. I myself have at times not been afforded that same respect and dignity.""

""But in this body, as long as I am president of the Senate and by the grace of God, I will be treated with respect and dignity, and I will treat everyone else with respect and dignity,"" she added. ""It is never my intention to make anyone offended, and I hope that others would consider that they would try not to offend me as well,"" she said. ""We are all equal under the law. And so I apologize, I apologize, I apologize, and I would hope, I would hope, that everyone would understand there is no intent to offend but that we would also give each other the ability to forgive each other.""

Please enter a valid email address.

FIRST ON FOX - Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and her former lover Nathan Wade are facing two ethics complaints from a conservative government watchdog group based on their court testimony on allegations they had an 'improper' affair.

The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) is requesting that the Georgia state bar open disciplinary proceedings against the Fulton County DA and Wade for violations of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct.

AAF is alleging Wade lied under oath about his relationship with Willis, and alleging that Willis admitted to keeping campaign money for personal use on the witness stand.

""To ensure that the citizens of Fulton County and the State of Georgia understand that the Bar will not countenance any violation of its ethics by those charged with upholding it, we urge you to revoke Ms. Willis’ license to practice law and permanently bar her from practicing law,"" adding the same request in a separate complaint against Wade.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

The complaint against Willis notes that on Feb 15. 2024 she testified before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee and was questioned regarding her reimbursement of Wade and her use of cash with no bank or transaction receipts. Willis was asked where the cash originally came from, to which she replied:

""Cash is fungible. I’ve had cash for years in my house. So for me to tell you the source of where it comes from ... when you go to Publix and you buy something and you get fifty dollars and you throw it in there. It’s been my whole life. When I took out a large amount of money during my first campaign, I kept some of the cash of that.""

AAF claims that Willis’ ""admission"" represents ""the admission of a clear violation of Georgia Campaign Finance law."" The portion of that law they say is applicable states that, ""Nothing in this Code section shall permit or authorize a candidate to utilize campaign funds for the purpose of making gifts, loans, or investments directly to: (A) The candidate…""

""The statute is unambiguous – and the facts are not in dispute – as Ms. Willis described in her testimony, she placed the money that was intended for her campaign into a ""fungible"" slush fund with other moneys that she would use for various other purposes, including reimbursing her boyfriend for leisure travel,"" the complaint states.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

The complaint also states that her ""keeping some of the cash"" was a ""willful intentional act and denied the citizens of Georgia the ability to exercise effective oversight over her campaign.""

""It is unreasonable to believe that a barred attorney running for public office would not have been aware that the strict reporting guidelines of Georgia campaign finance law existed to protect the public’s right to oversee elections and that she had an obligation to scrupulously abide by them,"" the complaint states.

The complaint against Wade alleges that he lied under oath on more than one occasion. When asked on an interrogatory to ""describe each instance in which you have had sexual relations with a person other than your spouse during the course of the marriage,"" and he said, ""none.""

Wade testified that his marriage ""was irretrievably broken in 2015"" but that he and his wife agreed to delay a divorce for the sake of their children.

""First it is simply not credible that Mr. Wade did not know that he had sexual relations with Ms. Willis when he replied to the interrogatories above in his divorce case. Put simply, it is clear Mr. Wade knew that he had had sex with Ms. Willis, and he knew that at the time he was still married, and he simply lied in the interrogatories,"" the AAF complaint states.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

""Whether he was married was not a complicated question. In fact, he was the plaintiff in a divorce case, a case that cannot proceed without the parties being married. As an officer of the court, this is simply unacceptable. It is challenging to think of a more clear-cut example of ‘dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,’"" the complaint says.

The complaint goes on to say that Wade’s ""rationale for not answering the interrogatories truthfully under questioning shows a whole lack of understanding of the law that makes him unfit to practice law in the State,"" deeming him a risk to future potential clients.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""The Bar owes the profession and the public a duty to guard the practice from charlatans and incompetents. Any simple reading of Mr. Wade’s testimony quickly reveals that he is so grossly unfamiliar with the simple understanding of a legal concept like marriage that the risk he and his incompetence poses to vulnerable members of the public requires his exclusion from the profession,"" it states.

Willis and Wade did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

House managers serve as ""prosecutors"" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.

One impeachment manager told Fox they had been given ""no clear guidance"" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.

Fox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Fox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.

RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS

Several factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.

That said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.

Some House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.

A senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a ""comprehensive briefing"" last week and ""detailed"" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.

Despite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that ""we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.""

Some House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.

Fox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing ""mock trial"" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.

HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS

""We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,"" said one frustrated manager.

There has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.

Managers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned ""subject lanes"" to argue before the Senate.

One manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.

FIRST ON FOX: A GOP lawmaker accused a nonprofit shelter network of sponsoring a migrant who was recently accused of killing a Georgia nursing student, letting him use its federally funded resources after he entered the U.S. illegally and before he allegedly committed the crime.

Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, sent a letter to Covenant House, a national network of youth homeless shelters, saying that Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) documents indicate that Jose Ibarra, 26, used a New York facility as his sponsor address after he crossed the border in September 2022.

Covenant House denied sponsoring Ibarra.

Gooden questioned whether Covenant House was properly vetting people who came through its doors, whether Ibarra lied about allegedly staying there, and if the organization was encouraging migrants to use its address on federal forms.

Covenant House told Fox News Digital it did not sponsor Ibarra and denied being contacted by federal authorities about him.

""Covenant House does not sponsor the entry of any migrants into the United States. It is neither a policy nor a practice. Covenant House New York did not sponsor Jose Antonio Ibarra’s entry into the country and has not done so for any other person,"" a spokesperson said.

""We do not know how our address came to be on his form, but there have been and continue to be instances when our address is given at the border. We have not been contacted by ICE/DHS regarding this matter, nor have we ever been contacted by them about the use of Covenant House’s name on a form at the border.""

Gooden's letter, sent to Covenant House CEO Bill Bedrossian, stated: ""According to CBP documents, after illegally crossing into El Paso, Jose Antonio Ibarra provided The Covenant House, a federally funded NGO in New York, as his sponsor address. These NGOs receive hundreds of millions in taxpayer funding per year through a left-wing loophole designed to circumvent a federal law that prevents tax dollars from funding illegal immigration.

""I have been fighting to hold NGOs like Covenant House accountable for years. Their usage of federal funds to traffic millions of migrants is unacceptable and has now become deadly.""

GEORGIA NURSING STUDENT FOUND DEAD ON UGA CAMPUS IDENTIFIED AS LAKEN RILEY

Ibarra is charged with murdering 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student Laken Riley, who was killed while jogging at the nearby campus of the University of Georgia.

Her death has sparked renewed scrutiny over how effectively U.S. officials are evaluating migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border before granting entry, primarily to await immigration court proceedings.

In his letter, Gooden asked Covenant House how long Ibarra had stayed at its facility, if he did, and whether Covenant House coordinates with groups in Mexico to share its address with people trying to enter the U.S.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

""Instead of prioritizing the safety and security of American citizens, the Biden administration has chosen to prioritize the interests of illegal immigrants, providing them with sanctuary and support at the expense of taxpayers,"" Gooden wrote.

""Covenant House and other federally funded NGOs must provide accountability and allow oversight from Congress. Failure to do so will result in swift action in the form of subpoenas.""

Gooden's letter does not indicate when Ibarra allegedly used the Covenant House address in New York. It is not uncommon for migrants who first arrive in the U.S. to list a shelter as their place of residence.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

FIRST ON FOX: A bicameral coalition of more than 130 Republican lawmakers penned a letter to the White House on Thursday, urging it to withdraw proposed tailpipe emissions regulations, forcing a transition to electric vehicles (EV).

The Republicans — led by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho — argued that the regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are a ""de facto EV mandate"" phaseout of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. They addressed the letter to President Biden and Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, which is expected to soon finalize the regulations.

""President Biden has made his intentions clear,"" Feenstra said in a statement. ""He would rather force American families — who are already facing financial hardship under the weight of inflation spurred by trillions in wasteful government spending — to buy electric vehicles to advance his Green New Deal agenda than allow folks to choose the best car or truck for their families, businesses, and farms at an affordable price.""

""This misguided decision also strengthens China while weakening our economy because the critical materials needed to manufacture electric vehicles are primarily sourced from China,"" the Iowa lawmaker added. ""Alongside Senator Mike Crapo, I’m proud to lead nearly 140 of my colleagues in urging President Biden to withdraw the proposed rule that would attempt to replace liquid fuels and combustion engines with unreliable and unaffordable electric vehicles.""

BIDEN ADMIN REPORTEDLY DOUBLING DOWN ON GAS CAR CRACKDOWN

Feenstra added that stories of Americans stranded in the cold waiting for their EV to charge during the winter provided further evidence that mandating EVs nationwide is ""ridiculous.""

Overall, under the proposal, which EPA unveiled in April 2023, the White House projected that 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases would be electric by 2032. In addition, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck, 35% of short-haul freight tractor and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could also be electric by then.

The White House said at the time that the tailpipe emissions proposal, which represents the most aggressive proposal of its kind ever proposed, would ""accelerate the clean vehicle transition"" and reduce oil imports by 20 billion barrels.

17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH

However, the proposal has faced widespread opposition from Republicans, as well as some Democrats and energy industry groups who say it will reduce consumer choice, lead to higher prices and benefit China, which dominates the EV battery supply chain. In December, the House voted 221-197, with five Democrats joining 216 Republicans, to pass a resolution nixing the EPA's proposal, but that bill has yet to receive a Senate vote.

""The reality is that most Americans still prefer the internal combustion engine vehicle, and EPA’s proposed rule unnecessarily restricts consumer choice and forces expensive EVs onto Americans at a time when they can least afford it,"" Feenstra, Crapo and the other Republicans wrote in their letter on Thursday.

""Major U.S. automakers have recently lowered their targets and pulled back planned investments in EVs due to low consumer demand and struggling EV units,"" they continued. ""Further, automobile dealers across the country have said EVs continue to sit unpurchased on dealership lots, despite automakers accepting massive losses and unsustainable government incentives.""

Late last year, thousands of auto dealers nationwide, including dealers in all 50 states and who collectively sell every major car brand, called on Biden to rescind the EPA proposal. They warned that, while some consumers are happy with EVs, demand is not keeping pace with supply and their lots are filling up with unwanted EVs.

VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE'

Further, the Republicans argued the Biden administration's proposal would make the U.S. more dependent on foreign supply chains, particularly those established in China. According to the International Energy Agency, China produces about 75% of all lithium-ion batteries and boasts 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% for anodes, two key parts of such batteries.

""Consequences of rules and regulations driven by the Biden Administration’s radical green agenda drastically reduce consumer choice and the affordability of vehicles available to Americans,"" said Crapo. ""Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable vehicles fueled by American-made energy products, not those primarily supplied by China.""

According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents several major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrid, up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.

At the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000.

In addition to Crapo, 23 other members of the Senate signed the letter, including Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Ranking Member John Barrasso, R-Wyo. Additionally, 113 House members signed the letter, including GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing JBS USA, the world's largest producer of beef, over the company's emissions and for ""greenwashing"" by allegedly misleading the public about its environmental impact.

In an announcement, James noted that beef production has the largest greenhouse gas footprint of any major food commodity and that animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. According to James, JBS USA's various net-zero pledges for 2030 and 2040 are therefore misleading and ""not feasible"" given the scope of its worldwide beef production operations.

""As families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis, they are willing to spend more of their hard-earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment,"" James said in a statement. ""When companies falsely advertise their commitment to sustainability, they are misleading consumers and endangering our planet.""

""JBS USA’s greenwashing exploits the pocketbooks of everyday Americans and the promise of a healthy planet for future generations,"" she added. ""My office will always ensure that companies do not abuse the environment and the trust of hardworking consumers for profit.""

GOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING UN FOR CALLING ON AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT

The lawsuit was applauded by state Democrats and national climate advocacy organizations like Earthjustice, Mighty Earth, Friends of the Earth US, Citizens Campaign for the Environment and Stand.earth.

""JBS repeatedly claims that it will reach net zero by 2040. This claim was found to be misleading and yet JBS continues to assert it,"" said Peter Lehner, an attorney at Earthjustice. ""While it is critical for every company to reduce its climate change impact, JBS would need to implement enormous operational changes to achieve this goal. However, JBS is doing very little and is not taking anywhere close to the steps that would be required.""

UN CLIMATE SUMMIT SERVING GOURMET BURGERS, BBQ AS IT CALLS FOR AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT

In her announcement and lawsuit, James pointed to several instances in which JBS USA and its executives made pledges to reduce the company's impact on the environment. She also stated the company — which has a market cap of more than $10 billion and whose North American beef business earns tens of billions of dollars annually — has acknowledged consumers are more interested in sustainable products.

For example, in March 2021, JBS announced a pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 across global operations and including indirect downstream emissions. The company then began a publicity campaign touting the pledge, running a full-page advertisement one month later in The New York Times stating ""it's possible"" for meat production to be ""part of the climate solution.""

Since then, JBS and its subsidiaries have continued to tout the 2040 pledge and other sustainability goals. The company even presented at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai late last year, announcing additional sustainability initiatives and investments.

TWO DOZEN REPUBLICANS CALL ON BIDEN TO DISAVOW JOHN KERRY'S REMARKS TARGETING FOOD PRODUCTION

""JBS takes its commitment to a more sustainable future for agriculture very seriously,"" JBS USA spokesperson Nikki Richardson said in an email to Fox News Digital. ""We disagree with the action taken today by the New York Attorney General’s office.""

""JBS will continue to partner with farmers, ranchers and our food system partners around the world to help feed a growing population while using fewer resources and reducing agriculture’s environmental impact,"" she continued. ""Our belief that American agriculture can help sustainably feed the world is undeterred.""

James' lawsuit comes as environmental groups and lawmakers worldwide increasingly set their sights on the agriculture industry. The global food system — which includes land-use change, actual agricultural production, packaging and waste management — generates about 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of 34% of total worldwide emissions, according to a 2021 study published in the Nature Food journal.

President Biden's international climate envoy John Kerry warned last year that decarbonization would be impossible without a concerted effort from the agriculture industry to achieve green goals.

""We can't get to net-zero, we don't get this job done unless agriculture is front and center as part of the solution. So all of us understand here the depths of this mission,"" Kerry said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Supreme Court expressed strong concerns on Monday about the sweep of state laws restricting how large social media companies moderate user content, a digital free speech case with implications in the political and business arenas.

Separate laws that passed in Florida and Texas and are now challenged in court would require Big Tech companies like X, formerly Twitter, and Facebook to host third-party communications but prevent those businesses from blocking or removing users' posts based on political viewpoints.

The regulations aim to address what some lawmakers call ""censoring"" of conservative messages, and banning politicians, like former President Trump, for violating subjective policies over offensive or ""problematic"" content.

But tech firms claim a First Amendment right as private entities to editorially regulate the billions of daily voices on their platforms — from political discourse and recipe sharing, to incitement and obscenity.

GOP AGS ASK SUPREME COURT TO PEEL BACK CONTENT MODERATION FROM BIG TECH IN LANDMARK FIRST AMENDMENT CASES

Justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum openly questioned whether the regulations would make it impossible for private companies to operate as a forum for free speech and expression.

""It covers almost everything,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor of Florida's law, which she said would affect what the arts and crafts retailer Etsy would have to allow on its digital marketplace. ""That's viewpoint discrimination. This falls under a whole lot of your listings and bans and disclosure requirements. Why are we imposing that on something like this?""

""The First Amendment restricts what the government can do,"" Chief Justice John Roberts told Texas' solicitor general. ""What the government’s doing here is saying 'you must do this, you must carry these people — you’ve got to explain if you don’t.' That’s not the First Amendment.""

But there was widespread unease about the best approach they should take at this stage.

Some justices suggested large companies that host wide-ranging speech platforms may be able to exercise greater editorial control, but that e-commerce sites like Etsy, Venmo, and Uber could be regulated by the states to some extent.

""This is a sprawling statute and it makes me a little bit nervous,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, over how a court opinion could be applied across the infinite variety of digital media. She said the competing interests ""had a bunch of landmines.""

Others on the bench wondered what the effect the big tech companies have on public discourse.

""There's a lot of new terminology bouncing around in these cases, and just out of curiosity — and one of them is content moderation,"" said Justice Samuel Alito. ""is it anything more a euphemism for censorship?""

JAN 6 RIOTERS, ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS: A LOOK AHEAD AT LANDMARK CASES SCOTUS WILL HEAR IN 2024

Alito also warned about resisting ""the Orwellian temptation to recategorize offensive conduct in seemingly bland terms.""

The Florida law would block a social media platform from engaging in censoring, prioritizing, or so-called ""shadow banning"" ""based on the content."" It also would prevent ""willfully deplatforming a candidate"" for public office for material posted by or about that candidate.

Both Florida and Texas would also require those companies to notify a user when their content has been modified or edited, along with an explanation for that action.

The states argue social media companies have outsized influence over what news and information the public sees, and say they have a long tradition of ensuring their citizens have full access to a range of viewpoints, calling social media platforms the new ""digital public square.""

The Florida and Texas laws were passed shortly after Twitter/X and Facebook separately removed Trump for their platforms, for his posts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots by his supporters.

Trump and a coalition of Republican-led states are among those filing separate amicus briefs supporting Florida and Texas

The Biden administration has opposed the state laws.

GOP SENATOR URGES SCOTUS TO REIN IN BIG TECH'S CONTENT CENSORSHIP THAT DEFIES 'LOGIC'

Trade groups representing big tech companies told the court the laws violate their free speech rights to decide what content meets their policies — saying their forums should not be an open-ended portal for offensive or dangerous speech — including school bullying, harassment, terrorist ideology, racial hatred, medical misinformation and voter fraud.

In almost four hours of oral arguments stretching well into the afternoon, the justices weighed whether to offer a sweeping ruling on the First Amendment implications of the state laws, or a more limited approach that might have the lower courts take another look at how those content moderation policies would be applied.

""Why isn't that a classic First Amendment violation for the state to come in and say, 'We're not going to allow you to enforce those sorts of restrictions?'"" asked Justice Elena Kagan.

""In your opening remarks,' Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked of Florida's Solicitor General Henry Whitaker, ""you said the design of the First Amendment is to prevent ‘suppression of speech.’ And you left out what I understand to be three key words in the First Amendment or to describe the First Amendment, 'by the government,'"" with Kavanaugh suggesting private companies should be given broader latitude to moderate their users content.

Attorneys for the states told the court that social media companies lack free speech protection since they only ""host"" viewpoints, similar to the telecommunications industry — known as ""common carriers"" — which transmits speech with no editorial oversight.

""Separating the wheat from the chaff here is pretty difficult,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch.

Justice Clarence Thomas, who light-heartedly noted he was the only member of the court who pre-dated the widespread use of the Internet was especially animated in his extensive bench remarks on the implications, asking tough questions of both sides.

""What do you do if it's a deep-learning algorithm which teaches itself and has very little human intervention?"" he asked at one point. ""So who's speaking then, the algorithm or the person?""

After the arguments, Florida Gov. Ron De Santis — on Twitter/X no less — said, ""We're gonna make sure we're doing everything we can to ensure people have a right to speak in these public forums. We want more speech, not less speech.""

These cases are just the latest in what is shaping up a busy term on the digital front at the Supreme Court.

The justices in March will hear an appeal from GOP-controlled states over whether federal government efforts to combat disinformation online violate the free speech rights of users on social media platforms.

Here too, those states say conservative political views are being silenced, after pressure on social media firms by the Biden administration.

And the justices have already heard arguments over whether public officials can block critical comments on their social media accounts from constituents.

Rulings in the cases argued Monday, Moody v. NetChoice, LLC and NetChoice, LLC v. Paxton, are expected by late June.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Former President Donald Trump claims that his wife Melania is expected to make more regular public appearances on the campaign trail.

Trump made the remarks during his interview at a Fox News townhall earlier this week with host Laura Ingraham.

""It’s funny, she was a very successful model, very, very successful, and yet she was a private person. She’s going to be out a lot. Not because she likes doing it, but she likes the results,"" he said Tuesday. ""She wants to see this country really succeed. She loves the country.""

TRUMP SAYS IT'S 'CRAZY' HOW CHRISTIANS, PEOPLE OF FAITH CAN VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS

""You know, a lot of first ladies would go out — they want to be everywhere. They get angry at their husband because he’s not introducing them,"" Trump continued. ""If I didn’t introduce Melania, she’d be very happy about it. She’s just a different kind of a person.""

Melania has been largely absent from her husband's 2024 presidential bid thus far, making few public appearances and staying out of the media.

Her absence, until recently, has been explained by the passing of her mother, Amalija Knavs, earlier this year. But as the campaign season becomes more intense, political commentators have questioned whether she will step back into efforts supporting Trump.

Trump also expressed appreciation that Melania has been dedicated to raising their son, Barron Trump.

""Her life revolves around that boy. It’s so important to her,"" Trump said. ""At the same time, it also revolves around our country and the success of our country. She’s raised a lot of money for charity. She’s a private person.""

""And she loves the country,"" Trump added. ""She’s going to be out a lot, but she does it for the good of the country, not for her. She’s somebody with a lot of confidence. She doesn’t need that.""

Trump's Fox News town hall came four days before South Carolina's Republican presidential primary, which commences Saturday.

The latest public opinion polls indicate that he maintains a very large double-digit lead over former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last major rival for the GOP nomination.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden told reporters on Wednesday that his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center went ""great,"" tamping down concerns over his health as the presidential election draws near.

Biden had just finished delivering remarks on how his administration’s policies on fighting crime in communities across the country are working when one reporter can be heard shouting if there’s anything Americans should know following his annual doctor’s visit.

""Well, they think I look too young,"" Biden replied.

Biden assured reporters that ""everything’s great"" regarding the check-up and that ""there is nothing different than last year.""

JACK SMITH RESPONDS TO BLISTERING HUR REPORT FOR FIRST TIME, SAYS BIDEN, TRUMP CASES NOT SIMILAR

Biden had revealed earlier Wednesday that he was making an unannounced trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a physical exam.

The exam comes after the report from Special Counsel Robert Hur that claimed the president had significant memory issues.

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, does not believe a cognitive test is necessary. She said O'Connor believes Biden proves his cognitive ability ""every day [in] how he operates and how he thinks.""

EX-OBAMA AIDES SAY AGE IS ‘VERY REAL ISSUE’ FOR BIDEN, WHO SOUNDS ‘FRAIL,’ ‘MUMBLY’

Biden received his last physical on Feb. 16 of last year, when his physician gave him a clean bill of health in a letter that said Biden was ""fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.""

Biden has undergone yearly physical examinations since the beginning of his term, in line with every other commander in chief since President Richard Nixon.

The Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the Global Times, touted President Biden and his campaign's use of TikTok, and critiqued the ""deep hypocrisy"" of America's politicians who call the social media platform a national security threat.

The opinion article in the CCP's state media said that Biden's campaign use of TikTok ""highlights the unjust suppression"" and ""proves the hype nonsense.""

""As a social media app that has been heavily portrayed by the US as a ‘national security threat,' TikTok being used by Biden's campaign highlights the unjust suppression of TikTok by American politicians and proves the hype nonsense,"" the article said.

BIG TECH FACES BRUTAL QUESTIONING ON CAPITOL HILL OVER CONTENT HARMING KIDS

The Global Times argued that the short-form video social media platform has become a ""necessary means"" for American politicians to reach young voters.

Citing a 2023 survey report by the Pew Research Center, the Global Times said that about one-third (32 percent) of young Americans aged 18 to 29 say they regularly get their news from TikTok.

The CCP newspaper said that American politicians are ""very self-contradictory when it comes to TikTok.""

The article argued that the Biden campaign's use of TikTok proves that the social media platform is not a national security threat and proves the ""deep hypocrisy"" of American politicians.

""In the end, we are witnessing that Washington's behavior toward TikTok is unacceptable to the public and society, so politicians have to choose to compromise for votes,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.

Jake Denton, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center, told Fox News Digital that Biden's ""hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats"" posed by TikTok.

President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America. — Jake Denton, Research Associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center

""Once again, President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America,"" Denton said. ""By choosing to use TikTok for his reelection campaign, he is callously disregarding warnings from both parties and national security experts that this Chinese-controlled technology imperils our national security through invasive data gathering and its ties to the CCP.""

""We cannot let one man’s thirst for social media virality and votes endanger our country,"" Denton said. ""The President must put America before his personal electoral interests, immediately delete TikTok, and join the bipartisan efforts to ban the app from operating on American soil.""

The Biden campaign's TikTok video sparked outrage after the administration banned the Chinese-owned app from federal devices over security concerns.

TIKTOK CEO GRILLED ON CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY INFLUENCE, SEARCHES OF TAYLOR SWIFT VS. TIANANMEN SQUARE

Last February, the administration set a 30-day deadline for government agencies to purge the app from federal devices.

The social media platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is popular among younger Americans.

Biden previously joined forces with TikTok influencers amid his re-election run, and the Democratic National Committee also joined the platform.

The president's campaign joining the Beijing-based social media platform could present unique security risks.

The Senate passed a stopgap measure Thursday night to avoid a government shutdown, which would have begun on Saturday, the first funding deadline for appropriations bills as laid out in the previous two-pronged spending bill.

Senators voted 77-13 to pass the continuing resolution, making the chamber aligned with the House. The bill now goes to President Biden to sign.

The continuing resolution passed the House earlier in the day, by a vote of 320-99. The bill moves funding deadlines to March 8 and March 22, rather than March 1 and March 8 initially agreed upon.

""We are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Wednesday, along with House Appropriations Committee Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine.

According to the lawmakers, six funding bills each for Agriculture-FDA, Commerce-Justice and Science, Energy and Water Development, Interior, Military Construction-VA, and Transportation-HUD will be taken up for votes and enacted ahead of the first deadline on March 8.

Negotiators are in agreement on the first six measures, which will be guided by both the Fiscal Responsibility Act discretionary spending limits, as well as the January topline spending agreement, per the statement. The deal laid out a $1.6 trillion topline amount for spending in the fiscal year, with $886 billion allotted for defense spending and $704 billion for non-defense purposes.

An additional slate of six bills, including those for Defense, Financial Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS, Legislative Branch, and State and Foreign Operations, are set to be agreed upon, taken up for votes, and signed into law ahead of the later March 22 deadline.

The latest continuing resolution is the fourth such extension since the Congress's failure to pass separate appropriations bills by the Sept. 30 deadline. It now heads to President Biden's desk for a signature to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.

EXCLUSIVE: Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican leader, is endorsing former President Trump for reelection.

It’s a key win for Trump from the establishment wing of the Republican Party. The South Dakota Republican is Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s top deputy in the Senate GOP.

""The primary results in South Carolina make clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president in this year’s pivotal presidential election. The choice before the American people is crystal clear: It’s Donald Trump or Joe Biden,"" Thune told Fox News Digital.

TRUMP MOVES CLOSER TO LOCKING UP GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WITH 20-POINT WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA

""I support former President Trump's campaign to win the presidency, and I intend to do everything I can to see that he has a Republican majority in the Senate working with him to restore American strength at home and abroad,"" he continued.

""Together we must put an end to the disastrous Biden-Schumer agenda. Our country cannot endure another four years of Bidenomics, continued lawlessness at our southern border, and American weakness on the global stage.""

Thune and Trump spoke by phone on Saturday night after Trump’s commanding victory in the South Carolina Republican primary, a source familiar with the call told Fox News Digital.

It wasn’t clear before now whether Thune, who’s seen as one of McConnell’s potential successors to lead the Senate Republican Conference, would endorse either of the two major candidates for the 2024 GOP nomination.

ONLY ON FOX: WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT HALEY AFTER TOPPING HER IN HER HOME STATE

Like McConnell, he suggested he would support whoever Republican voters chose as their presidential nominee, but Thune has for the most part avoided mentioning the former president.

He previously endorsed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott’s presidential campaign and was present at Scott’s launch event. Scott dropped out in November and endorsed Trump last month.

The Sunday announcement puts added pressure on McConnell, who has brushed off scrutiny on whether his frosty relationship with Trump would stop him from endorsing the ex-president in the Republican primary.

McConnell said at a press conference this month when asked about the race, ""I've stayed essentially out of it, and when I change my mind about that, I'll let you know.""

Both Thune and McConnell were targeted by Trump for criticizing his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and the 2020 election.

Thune won a landslide reelection victory for a fourth Senate term in 2022 despite Trump calling for a primary challenger against him.

His endorsement of the former president comes after Trump beat former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state primary on Saturday night. The ex-president won roughly 60% of the vote compared to 40% for Haley.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

FIRST ON FOX: A House Republican who has been critical of rushing to impeach President Biden is calling for his removal over questions about his mental fitness for the job.

Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told Fox News Digital that he plans to introduce a resolution on Monday to call on Biden’s Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution.

His most-cited reason was Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents. The report did not recommend any charges for the president but repeatedly painted him as an aging leader with a poor memory.

Buck said the report ""addressed what many Americans have long witnessed with their own eyes – that President Biden is no longer fit to successfully discharge the critical duties of his office.""

JAMES BIDEN SAYS HIS BROTHER 'HAS NEVER HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT' OR ANY 'FINANCIAL INTEREST' IN BUSINESS VENTURES

""Numerous instances were articulated in the report, and have played out in full public view, showing President Biden’s apparent cognitive decline and lack of mental stamina,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""The societal challenges and security threats our country faces are innumerable and require a chief executive with both strong mental and physical faculties. The time has come for the vice president and the Cabinet to put our country first and move forward on invoking the 25th Amendment.""

DEVON ARCHER: HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA EXECS ‘CALLED DC’ TO GET UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR FIRED

In his resolution text, Buck also cited Biden’s verbal stumbles and public gaffes as evidence of mental decline. It pointed out that Biden recently confused French President Emmanuel Macron with a predecessor who died decades prior, and that he also mixed up German leaders’ names and mistakenly referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico.

Biden and his allies have vigorously denied that his mental acuity is suffering.

But Buck’s resolution is a significant addition to the growing pressure for Biden officials to address scrutiny over the president’s mental fitness.

The Colorado Republican, who is retiring at the end of this term, is one of the few House GOP lawmakers who have publicly expressed wariness over the push to impeach Biden over allegations that he and his family’s businesses profited off of his political weight.

Buck voted along with the rest of the House GOP Conference to formalize the Biden impeachment inquiry in December, but just last week he criticized the probe’s leaders for relying on allegations made by FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who was recently indicted for lying to the bureau.

""We’ve always been looking for a link between what Hunter Biden received in terms of money and Joe Biden’s activities or Joe Biden receiving money. This clearly is not a credible link at this point,"" Buck said in a CNN interview.

He told the network in September, ""I want to make sure we don’t ruin this institution over a tit-for-tat impeachment. If the evidence is there… I will absolutely vote for impeachment. I don’t see the evidence at this point.""

Section 4 of the 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the White House Cabinet to declare the president unfit to perform his duties, transferring power to the vice president.

The president is able to take those powers back by writing to Congress that he is able to serve. The Cabinet would then have four days to refute that, after which Congress would vote on whether the president could remain in power.

Buck is one of several Republican lawmakers who have called for the constitutional amendment to be invoked in the wake of Hur's report, including Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, as well as Reps. Mary Miller, R-Ill., and Mike Collins, R-Ga.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment on Buck's resolution.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.

""This is a Joe Biden invasion,"" Trump said of the border crisis.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Colorado state legislature advanced a bill on Friday aimed at mandating K-12 schools statewide to implement policies requiring educators to address transgender students by their preferred name in all school settings – including in records and documents – independent of parental approval or a formal legal name change.

The bill will need one more round of voting before advancing to the Senate floor.

House Bill 1039 — a bill largely backed by the progressive group Colorado Youth Advisory Council — would also impact charter schools and mandates that educators use students' non-legal names in all school-related functions, including extracurricular activities, rosters, attendance lists, yearbooks and student ID cards.

In its proposal to lawmakers, the youth council said many ""school administrative systems cause humiliation for transgender Colorado youth when schools use the students’ deadnames (birth names that do not align with their gender identities).""

INDIANA PARENTS WARN NATION AFTER CHILD IS REMOVED FROM HOME FOR IMPROPER PRONOUN USAGE: ‘CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE’

""When schools keep a student’s former name and gender marker on school transcripts and records, it outs transgender students to their peers, thereby violating their privacy,"" the group wrote prior to the legislature's vote.

One Colorado, a progressive LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, also supports the bill, alongside the Colorado School Counselors Association.

The bill would also deem that ""intentional use of a name other than a student's chosen name is discriminatory.""

State Rep. Anthony Hartsook, a Republican, called the bill ""open-ended and ill-defined"" that could lead to ""many, many paths.""

""We open up Pandora's Box for discernment on what is discriminatory and what is not, what is intentional and what is not,"" Hatsook said on the House floor. ""Who starts deciding that when and where do we start deciding that? When and where do we bring the parents into that discussion?""

CAMPUS RELIGIOUS GROUPS REPORT GREATER INTEREST FROM STUDENTS TRYING TO FIND MEANING IN ‘CRUMBLING’ CULTURE

Republican State Rep. Brandi Bradley agreed with Hartsook and urged colleagues to vote ""no"" on the legislation.

""And now we have told the teachers that they're being discriminatory,"" Bradley said of the bill. ""I have four teenagers. They are awesome kids, but sometimes they like to play games. So tell me how codifying or putting this bill in is not going to go against teachers and their rights in a field where we already have so much shortage?""

Republican State Rep. Rose Pugliese added she does not want schools to know more about her kids than she does.

""Parents have the right to know,"" said Pugliese.

Other Republican lawmakers argued students would be allowed to change their names more than once, furthering burdening teachers to remember their new names.

Meanwhile, State Rep. Stephanie Vigil, a Colorado Springs Democrat co-sponsoring the bill, contended that some transgender kids who may not have come out to their parents yet would be in danger if the legislation is not approved. On the other hand, parents who support their transgender children would also have their parental rights usurped if they approve of the name change.

""And so I would just suggest to you all as we talk through this bill today that we bear in mind that there is such a thing as a kid who's not safe with their own parents,"" said Vigil. ""Certainly, kids belong with their parents – that relationship is precious. But I do not accept the premise that a child is anyone's property or that their safety isn't to be prioritized, even when the person who is a danger to them is their own parents.""

The bill was also sponsored by Democratic State Sens. Faith Winter, of Westminster, and Janice Marchman, of Loveland. State Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat and the legislature's only transgender member, is also a co-sponsor.

If cleared by the Senate and signed by the governor, the bill would go into effect in July 2025.

Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah are several states that have passed laws restricting pronoun use in schools.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Ahead of President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday, the White House debuted a new term for illegal immigrants arriving in the country, calling them ""newcomers.""

Biden will travel to Brownsville, Texas, in an effort to reassure voters who have soured on his handling of the border crisis. Republicans have lambasted the Biden administration for weak enforcement of immigration laws, and a recent poll showed that just 26% of Americans approved of the president's job on immigration.

The language the White House used to describe the crisis may not alleviate voters' concerns. In a fact sheet distributed by the White House press office to advocate for the bipartisan border agreement Biden has endorsed, officials pointed out that the bill includes $1.4 billion ""for cities and states who are providing critical services to newcomers.""

BIDEN'S BORDER VISIT LANDS ON ONE OF THE LEAST TRAFFICKED TOWNS, WHILE TRUMP IS HEADED INTO THE THICK OF IT

The reference to illegal immigrants as ""newcomers"" — which suggests equal status to migrants who come to the U.S. legally — provoked a swift condemnation from House Republicans.

""The Biden White House is now referring to illegal immigrants as ‘newcomers.’ Joe Biden is not serious about stopping the illegal immigration into the United States. This is a catastrophe by design,"" the House GOP conference posted on X.

White House officials have shot back at their GOP critics several times in recent weeks, asserting that if Republican lawmakers were serious about securing the border, they would support the bipartisan legislation President Biden has endorsed.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATIONS OF 36 STATES

The border bill negotiated in the Senate would increase Border Patrol staff and tighten asylum rules, expand law enforcement's authority to tackle fentanyl smuggling and increase funding to cities and states receiving asylum seekers.

Republicans argued the bill would normalize high levels of illegal immigration and do little to stop the flow of people and drugs over the border.

""We have done the work to make sure we're dealing with a broken immigration system. The Republicans have gotten in the way. They have gotten in the way,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday on CNN.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

""And so look, this is a serious matter, that‘s why the president is going to the border. The president was at the border a year ago in El Paso, visiting the border back in January 2023. He put a comprehensive, a comprehensive immigration policy on day one,"" she added.

Biden's choice of Brownsville for his border visit is an area that has seen comparatively small numbers of migrant crossings in Texas.

CBP data shows that Brownsville has seen just 46 migrant encounters over the past five days, compared to 2,106 in Eagle Pass. The former averaged 17 migrant encounters per day in February, while the latter averaged 462.

Brownsville is part of the CBP's Rio Grande Valley sector, which has seen 87,426 migrant encounters so far in FY 2024. The Del Rio sector that encompasses Eagle Pass has seen 182,077 encounters, but even that is far below the busiest sector, which lies around Tucson, Arizona, and has seen 297,380 encounters.

Former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, will visit Eagle Pass on Thursday in a competing visit, one of the most heavily trafficked areas in Texas and ground zero for Gov. Greg Abbott's fight with the Biden administration over enforcing immigration law.

Harris made the statement during a a recent interview last week before the Thursday release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on Biden's mishandling of classified documents, which described the president’s memory as having ""significant limitations.""

""I am ready to serve. There’s no question about that,"" Harris told The Wall Street Journal, adding that everyone who observes her work ""walks away fully aware of my capacity to lead.""

BIDEN CONSIDERED RESIGNING VICE PRESIDENCY ‘IN PROTEST’ OVER OBAMA'S AFGHANISTAN POLICY: HUR REPORT

Hur's report recommended no charges against Biden over his actions pertaining to the mishandling of classified documents, partly because he would have a defense at trial as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""

Republicans piled on Biden following the Hur report's release last week, but Democrats have also begun voicing — or at least admitting — greater concern surrounding Biden's age and whether that could hurt his chances at winning re-election this year.

Former President Bill Clinton's lead strategist, James Carville, argued Saturday that the White House has little confidence in Biden after he turned down a Super Bowl Sunday interview.

TREASURY CONFIRMS TERMS LIKE ‘MAGA,’ TRUMP,' KAMALA,' ‘BIDEN’ USED IN PRIVATE BANK TRANSACTION SEARCHES

""It’s the biggest television audience, not even close, and you get a chance to do a 20-25-minute interview on that day,"" Carville said. ""And you don’t do it? That’s a kind of sign that the staff, or yourself, doesn’t have much confidence in you. There’s no other way to read this.""

Another former Clinton strategist, Paul Begala, said Hur’s indictment of Biden’s memory and Biden's subsequent response was ""terrible for Democrats.""

""Oh yeah. Look, I’m a Biden supporter, and I slept like a baby last night: I woke up every two hours crying and wet the bed,"" Begala quipped on CNN last Friday. ""This is terrible for Democrats. And anybody with a functioning brain knows that,"" he declared.

The Biden administration finalized energy efficiency regulations targeting residential clothes washers and dryers in an effort to curb carbon emissions, as part of its broad climate agenda.

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced the final rules, which it projected will collectively save American households $2.2 billion per year on utility bills while reducing nearly 71 million metric tons of ""dangerous carbon dioxide emissions"" over the next three decades. DOE's regulations targeting the popular home appliances are slightly scaled down compared to the agency's draft proposal issued a year ago.

""For decades, DOE’s appliance standards actions for clothes washers and dryers have provided loads of savings for American families while also decreasing harmful carbon emissions,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.

""With strong support from industry leaders and consumer advocates, DOE will continue to roll out innovative appliance solutions throughout 2024 to lower costs for the American people — continuing the cycle of household savings that are the backbone of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,"" she continued.

BIDEN ADMIN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TARGETING HOME APPLIANCES WITH ECO REGULATIONS IN 2023

Under the regulations, certain less-efficient models of washers and dryers will be barred from being sold, according to DOE.

The clothes washers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 0.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 3% compared to the profile of models currently on the market. And the dryers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 2.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 11% compared to products on the market now.

BIDEN ADMIN BACKS OFF GAS STOVE CRACKDOWN AFTER WIDESPREAD PUSHBACK

DOE said the regulations largely reflect an agreement issued in September by environmental groups and industry associations.

""Standards at these levels will significantly reduce household energy bills and planet-warming emissions, period,"" Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said after the agreement was reached at the time.

""Swiftly establishing standards at these strong levels will allow the Department of Energy to continue to make progress with the highly successful efficiency standards program — which already saves the average household $500 annually on their energy bills,"" added Natural Resources Defense Council staff attorney Joe Vukovich.

BIDEN ADMIN'S WAR ON HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES WILL CAUSE HIGHER PRICES, DIRTIER CLOTHES AND DISHES, EXPERTS WARN

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) — which heavily criticized DOE's original proposal last year on washers and dryers — also signed onto the agreement. AHAM CEO Kelly Mariotti said in September that the compromise regulations would allow ""manufacturers to continue to offer a complete range of energy-efficient products.""

""What we're learning is that the government ought to get out of the business of doing these regulations,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""And not try to just float really extreme ones and then come up with something that's less extreme.""

""The main concern with these negotiated rulemakings is that it mostly involves the manufacturers and the energy efficiency activists,"" he added. ""One wonders how much the interests of consumers are taken into account during this process.""

The new standards for washers and dryers, meanwhile, are the latest in a long string of energy efficiency regulations unveiled by DOE over the last 12 months. Climate activists have argued such regulations are necessary to combat global warming, noting that the commercial and residential sector accounts for the largest share of total end-use carbon emissions of any sector in the U.S.

However, Republican lawmakers and free market advocates have argued the rules restrict consumer choice and lead to increased upfront costs.

""DOE should be looking for ways to address the problems caused by the existing washing machine regulations rather than making things worse with tougher new regulations,"" Lieberman told Fox News Digital.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Catch me at the border

President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday reflects his wishful thinking on the issue, arriving at one of the least-trafficked towns on the border.

Biden will visit Brownsville, Texas, which ranks as the 29th-most trafficked town by illegal border-crossers, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Former President Trump, meanwhile, is set to hold a competing visit to the border, though he will arrive at Eagle Pass, Texas, one of the most heavily-trafficked towns in the country.

Biden's trip to Texas is an attempt to address his deep unpopularity on the issue, with a recent poll showing just 26% of Americans support his handling of the border.

The White House says Biden will use the visit to renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing at the border as well as tightening asylum rules, moved to tackle fentanyl smuggling, and increased funding to communities and NGOs receiving migrants. Republicans argued it fell well short of what is necessary.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.

While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November.

Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says ""the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.""

""I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,"" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'

Smith’s ""primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,"" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, ""there might not be a trial.""

Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a ""host"" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as ""motivated"" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall.

Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.

HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Manual states, ""Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.

""Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,"" Turley said.

John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.



""If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,"" Shu said. ""It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.

""The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.""

""This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,"" Shu added.

On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, ""Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.""

But, Turley said, ""the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.""

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

""The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,"" Turley said.

""The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection.

""So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.""

Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said ""the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.""

""But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,"" Trusty said.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

A New York judge presiding over former President Donald Trump’s civil fraud case has denied his legal team’s request to avoid paying a $355 million penalty in the case.

Trump lawyers had asked Judge Arthur Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an ""orderly post-judgement process.""

In an email to the defendants posted Thursday to the court docket, Engoron said they had ""failed to explain, much less justify, any basis for a stay.""

""I am confident that the Appellate Division will protect your appellate rights,"" he wrote.

Last week, Trump was barred from operating his business in New York for three years and was found liable for $355 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

HAYLEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: ‘LET’S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

James said Monday she was prepared to seize Trump's assets if he is unable to pay the massive judgment handed down in his civil fraud case.

Trump could be at risk of losing some of his prized properties if he can't pay his staggering New York civil fraud penalty. With interest, he owes the state nearly $454 million — and the amount is going up $87,502 each day until he pays.

Engoron concluded that Trump lied for years about his wealth as he built the real estate empire that vaulted him to stardom and the White House. Trump denies wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal.

Trump's ability to pay his mounting legal debts is increasingly murky after back-to-back courtroom losses. In January, a jury ordered him to pay $83.3 million for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.

Trump claimed last year that he has about $400 million in cash — reserves that would get eaten up by his court penalties. The rest of his net worth, which he says is several billion dollars, is tied up in golf courses, skyscrapers, and other properties, along with investments and other holdings.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.""

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said.

Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.

SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY

Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.

NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,"" a spokesperson said. ""He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.""

Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.

GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered ""no"" when asked if ""undocumented immigrants"" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.

In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.

But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are ""inherently more unsafe.""

""It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.

""Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,"" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.

""But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,"" he said.

""And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,"" he said.

There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel will formally resign her position after the March 5 Super Tuesday primaries, weeks after former President Trump asked her to step down.

The announcement comes weeks after Trump revealed his recommendations for changes within the RNC earlier this month. He proposed that North Carolina GOP chair Michael Whatley take over as chairman, while his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita also receive leadership positions.

""It has been the honor and privilege of my life to serve the Republican National Committee for seven years as Chairwoman to elect Republicans and grow our Party,"" McDaniel said in a statement. ""I have decided to step aside at our Spring Training on March 8 in Houston to allow our nominee to select a Chair of their choosing. The RNC has historically undergone change once we have a nominee and it has always been my intention to honor that tradition.""

""I remain committed to winning back the White House and electing Republicans up and down the ballot in November,"" she added, before thanking her husband, family and RNC staff.

As he has moved closer to securing the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has been ramping up his calls for changes and new leadership at the GOP's national party committee.

TRUMP RECOMMENDS NORTH CAROLINA GOP CHAIR WHATLEY TO REPLACE MCDANIEL AT RNC: SOURCE

The former president met with McDaniel at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida in early February.

Trump wrote in his Truth Social platform following the meeting that McDaniel was a ""friend"" but that he would be urging changes at the RNC after the Feb. 24 South Carolina GOP presidential primary.

McDaniel was nominated by Trump soon after his presidential election victory in 2016, and she won re-election in 2019, 2021, and January of last year.

Gov. Kathy Hochul has called on online map and social media companies to stop listing unlicensed cannabis dispensaries.

Yelp said the company believes ""consumers have a First Amendment right to read and write about all businesses, even if unlicensed.""

After failing to wipe illegal cannabis dispensaries off the map, New York is asking online sites to hide them.

Since the state legalized marijuana in 2021, unlicensed pot shops have proliferated across New York City, with limited pushback from authorities. On Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul called on online map and social media companies to stop listing them.

""If you type in ‘cannabis dispensaries’ in Google Maps or Yelp, you’ll get a long list of unlicensed illegal vendors,"" Hochul, a Democrat, said Tuesday, speaking to reporters alongside some of the owners of licensed, legal weed stores that make up a tiny minority of the cannabis shops in New York City.

FEDERAL JUDGE GREEN LIGHTS NEW YORK MARIJUANA LICENSING DESPITE 'DISASTER' LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET ROLLOUT

In a statement, Yelp said the company believes ""consumers have a First Amendment right to read and write about all businesses, even if unlicensed.""

""Allowing users to contribute and see information ... about unlicensed businesses serves the public interest and provides a resource for regulators to determine whether any particular business has appropriate licenses,"" the statement read.

Legal marijuana shops in New York pay a vice tax, purchase from local farms, and submit to quality control testing to ensure their products aren’t laced with other drugs and aren’t stronger or weaker than their label says.

NEW YORK GOV. KATHY HOCHUL PROPOSES LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL POT SHOPS

But so far, fewer than 80 cannabis licensed stores have opened around the state, where strict eligibility requirements and lawsuits have contributed to slowing the rollout. Meanwhile, it’s common for a single neighborhood in New York City to have a dozen illegal ones.

Hochul vowed to crack down eight months ago, but has failed to make noticeable progress.

Aiming to avoid an echo of prohibition-era criminalization of drug sales, New York state’s marijuana legalization doesn’t include severe criminal punishment for illegal sales and doesn’t allow most law enforcement agencies to enforce pot laws.

Legislation that Hochul signed last May gave the state powers for inspections, seizures, fines that can reach $20,000 a day and, in some cases, close shops and go after landlords.

But the governor on Wednesday said she has since learned that it wasn't enough. She said the fines aren't high enough to deter people, and noted the appeals process takes many months, allowing shops to continue raking in tax-free profits off unlicensed products that are less expensive because they can be purchased out of state.

New York City itself has tried to stem the tide by going after landlords, but Mayor Eric Adams has been imploring Albany to grant the city more power to respond.

Hochul has asked the Democrat-controlled state Legislature to pass new legislation to grant more enforcement authority to city agencies, increase fines, and give law enforcement permission to shut down illegal stores before the appeals process plays out.

In the meantime, Hochul is asking tech companies ""to not be posting the sites that are illegal and ensure that they’re posting the legal shops.""

Local cannabis entrepreneur Osbert Orduña said Google Maps keeps delisting his legal shops, one in New Jersey, and another in Queens, New York. He said he’s never had trouble with his listings on Yelp, though he’d like the site to delist illegal operators as well.

NEW YORK LAWMAKERS CONSIDER ADDING POT SHOP CRACKDOWN TO OVERDUE BUDGET

""Four times, Google has taken us down off of their platform for ‘violating their terms of service.’ We’ve done nothing other than have our store hours and our basic business information listed,"" he said.

Google didn't immediately respond to a query about Orduña's specific circumstances, but noted in a statement responding to Hochul's comments that it does remove listings for closed venues.

""If we can confirm that a business has closed for any reason – including license issues – we’ll reflect that it’s closed in the listing. We also prohibit cannabis ads in New York and remove them upon detection, often before they ever run,"" the statement read.

Orduña said he also wants his illegal competitors, some of whom he knows personally, to be closed down. He says they tell him he's playing a ""sucker's game."" But as a former Marine, he likes to do things by the book and even plans on expanding to open another store in Queens next week.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

""This is an open primary,"" Haley emphasized in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview this week.

The former two-term Palmetto State governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in the former president's administration notes that ""anybody can vote in the primary, as long as you didn't vote in the Democrat primary on February 3rd in South Carolina.""

LIVE UPDATES: SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRIMARY

Trump is the 2024 GOP frontrunner as he bids a third straight time for the White House. He grabbed a majority of the votes last month in Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary victories and won by a landslide earlier this month in the Nevada and U.S. Virgin Island caucuses to close in on locking up the nomination.

HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL WIN THE NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: ‘LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

The final polls in South Carolina showed Trump maintaining a large double-digit lead over Haley, the last remaining major rival challenging the former president.

Independents helped fuel Haley's 43% showing in New Hampshire, where she lost to Trump by 11 points. But while independent voters have long played a crucial and influential role in the first-in-the-nation primary, they are much less of a factor in South Carolina's more conservative electorate, where evangelical voters enjoy prominence in GOP contests.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS ‘A**-KICKING' FOR HALEY IN HER HOME STATE, BUT SHE SAYS ‘I REFUSE TO QUIT’

A Monmouth University poll about South Carolina's primary conducted last weekend had Trump with a 72%-to-25% lead among Republicans questioned, similar to how he performed with GOP voters in New Hampshire. Haley, meanwhile, held a narrow 53%-46% advantage among independents.

The problem for Haley is nearly two-thirds of those sampled by the survey indicated they were Republicans, with only 28% identifying as independents.

Longtime South Carolina-based Republican consultant Dave Wilson, who remains neutral in the primary, noted ""there is no party registration in this state.""

""They're targeting what would be considered independent or swing voters. There's just not that many in South Carolina. You're either an R or a D in this state,"" Wilson said, addressing Haley's campaign efforts.

He added the Haley campaign and aligned groups are ""trying to find people who are so against Donald Trump that they're willing to step into a Republican booth and choose her name just to vote against Trump.""

Haley's allies are also making a pitch for Democrats who didn't cast a ballot in the party's relatively low turnout presidential primary earlier this month to vote in the GOP contest.

HALEY ACCUSES TRUMP OF SIDING WITH A DICTATOR AND TYRANT'

""If you did not vote in the February 3rd Democratic primary, you are eligible to vote on February 24th."" a mailer sent to Democratic voters by the Haley-aligned super PAC SFA Fund states.

""Your vote can make a difference,"" the mailer emphasized. ""Please participate by voting for Nikki Haley and make your voice heard.""

Haley has repeatedly vowed to march on regardless of her finish on Saturday. Michigan, on Tuesday, holds the next contest, and it's also an open primary.

In early March, nearly 800 delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday, and over 150 will be at stake over the ensuing two weeks. Among the states holding contests on Super Tuesday are delegate-rich California and Texas, and other big states like Florida, Illinois and Ohio will hold winner-take-all primaries March 19. Polling in many of those states indicates Trump holding large leads over Haley.

But Haley's campaign notes that 11 of the 16 Super Tuesday contests aren't limited to registered Republicans.

Campaign manager Betsy Ankeny in a recent memo highlighted that the upcoming open primaries contain ""significant fertile ground for Nikki.""

Trump and his allies have repeatedly blasted Haley over the courting of independents and even some Democrats.

""The Democrats are giving her money, and she's playing into the game. And I think she just can't get, she just can't get herself to get out. She is doing poorly in the polls. Look, if she was doing well, I'd understand it, but she's doing very poorly,"" Trump said Tuesday in a Fox News town hall in Greenville, South Carolina.

Haley, in an interview the next morning on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom,"" fired back.

TRUMP RUNNING MATE AUDITIONS ON THE SOUTH CAROLINA CAMPAIGN TRAIL

""He can keep saying I have big Democrat donors. At the same time, look at his disclosures. But I don't ask donors whether they're Republican, Democrat or independent,"" she said.

""We're fighting for the Republican primary, but there are a lot of independents who left the Republican Party because of Donald Trump. We are pulling them back. … We're pulling Reagan Democrats back. And Republicans need to remember this is not about pushing people out of our party. And that's why I do well with everybody, not just Republicans, not just independents.""

Seasoned Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams pointed out that ""it's up to each state to choose its process. … That's generally been a principle of states' rights that Republicans have long supported.""

Williams, a veteran of Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, noted that when Romney won the nomination a dozen years ago ""we were essentially the establishment and tried to draw in independents to offset what seemed to be a rotation of conservative challengers.

""We courted independent voters, and we had an eye on the general election too,"" Williams recalled. ""We wanted to make sure we were drawing independents to vote for us in the primary who would hopefully stick around for the general election.""

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News,"Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.

In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.

Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.

When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.

The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.

That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.

ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT

As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.

Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.

TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.

Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.

""We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,"" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. ""The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.""

The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.

The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.

Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.

""If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,"" Kim said.

Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.

""I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,"" she said. ""I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.""

She added: ""Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.""

REPUBLICAN HOPES

The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.

Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.

GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES

Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.

Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send ""ticked off"" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.

A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.

""We’ll come together,"" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. ""The threat from Republicans is too much.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.

The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a ""bump stock"" device is a ""machine gun"" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""

After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that ""bump stocks"" are machine guns.

The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.

GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several ""bump stocks"" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.

""It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,"" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.

But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.

The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.

""I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.""

Justice Samuel Alito called that ""disturbing.""

""These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.""

A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.

TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE

As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will ""bump"" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.

Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.

The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.

GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'

Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.

The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.

The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.

Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.

The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire ""automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""

Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.

""The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.""

After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, ""Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?""

But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.

""Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ""but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?""

The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.

""This is totally confusing,"" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.

""Now I'm completely lost,"" added Sotomayor at one point.

Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

""If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,"" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.

Supporters of the ban say it saves lives.

""Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,"" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. ""ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.""

A ruling is due by early summer.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The LAO laid out the grim forecast in a Tuesday report that cautions that a $24 billion ""erosion in revenues"" corresponds to a $15 billion increase in the state's budget problem. Due to this, the budget deficit, which last month was estimated to hit $58 billion, could now go as high as $73 billion.

""The actual increase in the state's budget problem will depend on a number of factors, including formula-driven spending changes, most notably Proposition 98 spending requirements for schools and community colleges,"" the report said.

H.D. Palmer, the deputy director of California's Department of Finance and Newsom's spokesperson on budget matters, responded to the new LAO report by telling Fox News Digital that their budget shortfall differs from the $38 billion they estimate.

""From now through April, more than $51 billion in income and corporate tax receipts are forecast to come in,"" Palmer said. ""No one can say today with certainty how those numbers may change the budget estimate of a $38 billion shortfall.""

""A responsible step would be for the Legislature to act now on the early action budget measures needed for $8 billion in solutions to help close this gap,"" he added.

California saw its first-ever population decline in 2020 when the state imposed rigid lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 2020 to July 2022, the state lost well over half a million people, with the number of residents leaving surpassing those moving in by almost 700,000.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said she was ""proud"" to cast a protest vote against President Biden in Michigan's Democratic primary on Tuesday.

Tlaib's comments were shared in a video by Listen To Michigan, a group dedicated to getting Democrats in the Great Lakes State to vote ""uncommitted"" in the primary election.

Biden's stance on Israel's war in Gaza has earned him fierce backlash from Arab American and Muslim community leaders, particularly in Michigan, which is home to one of the largest Muslim communities in the U.S.

""Hi everyone, it's Rashida. I was proud today to walk in and pull a Democratic ballot and vote uncommitted. We must protect our democracy, we must make sure that our government is about us, about the people,"" Tlaib said. ""When 74% of Democrats in Michigan support a ceasefire yet President Biden is not hearing us, this is the way we can use our democracy to say listen.""

TRUMP SAYS SOUTH CAROLINA IS 'BIGGER WIN THAN WE ANTICIPATED,' LOOKS FORWARD TO SAYING 'JOE, YOU'RE FIRED'

""Listen to the families right now that have been directly impacted, but also listen to majority of Americans that are saying enough. No more wars, no more using our dollars to fund a genocide. No more. So please, take your family members, use our democratic process to speak up about your core values, where you want to see our country go.""

Tlaib said it was the first time her 18-year-old son had voted in an election.

Progressive-led campaigns and lawmakers have hammered Biden's re-election campaign over the U.S.'s handling of the Middle East conflict.

In addition to Listen To Michigan, a group called Abandon Biden has been pushing voters to actively oppose the president for his failure to call for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza.

TRUMP 'REALLY NOT THINKING ABOUT' HALEY AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA VICTORY, SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON BEATING BIDEN

Abandon Biden is specifically targeting voters in swing states, which could prove critical in the 2024 race that is likely to pit Biden against his old political foe, former President Trump.

Tlaib has been among Biden's most vocal left-wing critics in Congress in the wake of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants launched a surprise invasion in southern Israel, killing over 1,000 people and taking dozens more hostage.

Israel has responded with heavy bombardment and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters, has said nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in the resulting conflict.

Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, has spent the last day urging Michiganders on social media to also protest Biden in the Democratic primary.

She wrote in one post on her Instagram Story, ""We attend marches and protests all the time! We can stand at a polling station for EVERY CHILD KILLED in Gaza. Don't stay home. Help the uncommitted campaign.""

Gun Owners Of America came out swinging against Senator John Cornyn, R-TX, after he entered the race to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Aidan Johnston, Gun Owners Of America’s (GOA) Federal Affairs Director, said tCornyn has failed to stand firm on conservative values and has instead, compromised with Democrats on gun control bills.

""Every time gun control gains steam in Congress, Senator John Cornyn is right there working with Democrats on a 'compromise.' That isn't conservative leadership, it's capitulation!,"" Johnston said.

CROWDED FIELD OF POTENTIAL MCCONNELL SUCCESSORS EMERGES IN SENATE

The GOA said that Sen. Cornyn's record on gun rights makes him ""wholly unfit"" to become the Senate minority leader.

""In the eyes of gun owners and all those who treasure our liberties, the traitor from Texas' record makes him wholly unfit to lead Republicans in the Senate,"" Johnston said.

The conservative gun rights group said Cornyn has helped pass a series of bills that are ""gross infringements"" on the Second Amendment.

The GOA pointed to Cornyn over the Safer Communities Act, which he cosponsored with Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy in 2022.

The bill incentivizes states to pass extreme risk protection laws, also called ""red flag"" laws, that allow members of the public and law enforcement to petition the courts for a civil order to temporarily suspend a person's access to firearms for fear that person might do violence.

MITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER

After gun rights advocates raised Second Amendment concerns, Congress included requirements that states applying for federal grants to implement red flag laws include certain due process protections.

""Sen. Cornyn is responsible for helping pass the so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that, among other things, bribes states to enact 'red-flag' gun confiscation laws, creates a national de facto wait period for young adults to buy a gun, and creates a backdoor ATF rule to eliminate the private sale of firearms,"" Johnston said. ""These are gross infringements on the Second Amendment.""

""The best thing Senator Cornyn could do for gun rights is join Mitch McConnell in retirement,"" he said.

Another conservative group, the National Association for Gun Rights, also came out against Cornyn's bid to replace McConnell.

""Cornyn is the most anti-gun Republican in Congress,"" said Dudley Brown, President of the National Association for Gun Rights. ""His sponsorship of ‘Fix NICS’ and proud role in passing the largest gun control bill in decades (Biden’s so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act) is repulsive to law-abiding gun owners.""



""When the most anti-gun President in history calls an anti-gun Republican ‘rational’ that should set off alarm bells in every law-abiding gun owners’ head,"" Brown added.

The gun groups' statements on Sen. Cornyn came after McConnell, 82, announced Wednesday that he plans to step away from leadership after becoming the longest-serving party leader in Senate history.

""I am asking my Republican colleagues to give me the opportunity to succeed Leader McConnell,"" said Cornyn, 72, in a statement released Thursday.

In the developing pool of potential successors, Cornyn is frequently mentioned as one of the ""three Johns"" likely to next lead the conference. The other two are Sens. John Thune, R-S.D. and John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Sen. Cornyn's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Former President Trump will win the Michigan Republican Primary Tuesday night, winning yet another early contest and additional delegates — bringing him one step closer to being able to formally secure the GOP nomination.

The Associated Press projected Trump will win the primary shortly after polls closed Tuesday night.

With the Michigan win, Trump has claimed victory in every primary and caucus of the 2024 GOP presidential primary cycle.

Trump, who will likely secure the GOP nomination by next week after the Super Tuesday primary contests, dominated the Iowa caucuses, left New Hampshire with a commanding victory, swept caucuses in Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, won South Carolina with a ""bigger win"" than he anticipated.

MICHIGAN PRIMARY PUTS MAJOR BATTLEGROUND STATE IN PLAY FOR 2024

Trump needs 1,215 delegates to formally secure the nomination.

Both Republican and Democratic voters in Michigan hit the polls Tuesday to cast their ballots in the state-run primaries.

Republican voters on Tuesday had their choice from Trump, the clear frontrunner, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — the only two GOP candidates in the race — and others who have since dropped out, including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

JAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER 'UNCOMMITTED' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: 'HUGE PROBLEM'

There are 16 delegates at stake.

Trump called into the Michigan GOP Watch Party Tuesday night shortly after the race was called in his favor.

""I just want to thank everybody. This was a great day,"" Trump said, pointing to the state's autoworkers, saying Democrats ""destroyed the autowork business,"" but vowed to ""bring it all back into Michigan"" if elected.

""I just want to thank everybody…the numbers are far greater than we even anticipated,"" he said, adding that he will ""be doing a lot of campaigning over the next couple of months.""

""I can tell you this November cannot come fast enough,"" Trump said. ""We have the worst president in history--the most incompetent and the most corrupt president, and we can't let this continue.""

""So that day, November 5th, and January 20th is when we take over,"" Trump said, referring to Election Day and Inauguration Day. ""We're going to make America great again, greater than ever before.""

Democratic voters also had their chance to vote in the primary, casting ballots for President Biden or his Democratic challengers, Rep. Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson. Those voters also had the option to cast an ""uncommitted"" vote.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

It is almost too early to truly understand and divine where the votes might for someone to succeed retiring Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

The reason? The universe and conditions under which Republican senators will vote next fall to pick their new leader haven’t formed yet. Yes, take a look at the three Johns: Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), former Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). Even someone like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) could be in play. A source tells FOX is interested in the race.

GOP WON’T TAP MCCONNELL'S SUCCESSOR UNTIL NOVEMBER

But beyond that, we don’t know much.

Here’s why:

We have to first know who wins the presidential election. And if 2024 is anything like 2020, we might not definitively know until week or more after the election. A delay in figuring out the winner could delay the internal secret leadership election which Senate Republicans will take in mid to late November. But the winner of the presidential election will dictate who the GOP wants – especially if former President Trump prevails and has much to say about it.

Ironically, FOX is told that the antipathy between the former President and McConnell was not a major factor in the decision-making of the Kentucky Republican to step down.

MITCH MCCONNELL SENDS 'SHOCKWAVES' THROUGH SENATE WITH SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT

Another factor: who has control of the Senate – and by how many seats. Keep in mind we didn’t know until January 2021 as to which party would control the Senate in the last Congress.

This is why other figures may emerge. Especially dark horses.

As I have written before, leadership elections in Congress are not ""partisan politics"" They are ""particle politics."" The person who is propelled into leadership is not always the obvious choice: Think former House Speakers John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Or even current House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

WHY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS' IMPEACHMENT TRIAL MAY BE ON 'HIATUS'

FOX is told that some Senate Republicans are tired of what one senior Senate GOP leadership source termed a ""weekly MAGA show"" by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), JD Vance (R-Ohio) and others at the weekly Senate Republican Conference meetings. So if former President Trump loses and if the GOP doesn’t have control of the Senate, that could dictate who Republicans pick.

However, if Republicans prevail with a substantial majority, look at Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) as a possibility. He leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP’s campaign arm. Daines has made many of the right moves so far in GOP contests. If Republicans win the Senate by a good margin, some members (especially the new ones), might be willing to give Daines a look – if he’s interested.

The same factor could undercut Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). It’s not clear if Scott is interested. He ran unsuccessfully against McConnell in the fall of 2022. Scott led the GOP’s campaign efforts in 2022 – and Republicans failed to win the Senate. That could be an albatross for Scott and potentially inhibit him from making another run at leadership.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A top House Republican lawmaker is changing his mind about retirement after urging from former President Donald Trump.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., said on Thursday that he is reversing course on his decision to not run for a fourth term.

""While my strong desire was to leave Congress at the end of this year, since my announcement, I have received countless calls from constituents, colleagues, and President Trump urging me to reconsider,"" Green said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""I will be running for re-election so I can be here on Day 1 next year to help President Trump end this border crisis once and for all.""

TRUMP WINS THE MICHIGAN GOP PRIMARY, BRINGING HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO SECURING REPUBLICAN NOMINATION

His announcement came shortly after Trump urged Green to reconsider in a post on his Truth Social account. The former president said he would endorse Green if he ran.

""Mark Green has had lots of options because of his political talents, and the great job he has done as a Congressman, but given the fantastic work he’s doing as Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I hope he runs for Re-Election to the U.S. House of Representatives. If he does, he has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"" Trump wrote.

In addition to running for his own re-election, Trump is throwing his influence into House and Senate races across the country with various endorsements and behind-the-scenes maneuvering.

TRUMP HOLDS LARGE DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD OVER HALEY AHEAD OF CRUCIAL SHOWDOWN

He met recently with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ campaign arm.

Their sit-down at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, earlier this month primarily involved discussions about the 2024 election cycle and how to keep and expand Johnson’s razor-thin two-seat House majority.

As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Green has played a leading role in the House’s impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

He told Fox News Digital last week that his role has been ""challenging, rewarding and meaningful.""

EXCLUSIVE: A New York City police officer who was attacked by migrants in Times Square is coming to Washington, D.C., to watch President Biden tout his administration’s work over the last year in his State of the Union address.

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only Republican representing New York City in the House, told Fox News Digital she invited NYPD Lieutenant Ben Kurian to the president’s major address on Wednesday.

""Our NYPD officers are on the front line every single day working to keep our streets safe, and unfortunately, now they are being forced to deal with hundreds of violent crimes being committed by those in our country illegally,"" Malliotakis said.

ICE OFFICIAL RIPS NYC POLICIES SHIELDING POLICE-BEATING MIGRANTS FROM DEPORTATION

""The horrifying video of Lt. Kurian and his fellow officer being attacked by a mob in Times Square was hard to watch, but it shed a light on just how difficult our officers’ jobs have become.""

She said his presence at Biden’s speech will ""bring attention to the need for the Biden administration to end its dangerous border policies.""

A now-viral video from late January showed two officers being attacked by a group of migrants in the heart of New York City’s tourist area.

NYPD CHIEF BLASTS MIGRANTS' ATTACK ON OFFICERS AS MUGSHOTS OF SUSPECTS RELEASED

One suspect can be seen kicking an officer in the head twice while another person kicked the other officer in the back.

The attack began after the police officers asked migrants who were blocking the sidewalk outside a shelter to disperse, the NYPD has said.

The incident was a flashpoint in the tension that’s long been simmering in New York City since it was flooded by thousands of migrants, many seeking asylum. A number were bussed up by Southern governors whose states were buckling under the strain of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

More than 161,000 migrants have come to New York City in need of shelter and other city resources since the middle of 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said.

AMERICANS AREN’T SAFE WITH BIDEN'S OPEN BORDER AND THE SYSTEM IS ‘FLASHING RED’

Earlier this week, Adams, a Democrat, called for curtailing the city’s ""sanctuary"" status to allow migrants ""suspected of serious crimes"" to be turned over to federal law enforcement.

Republican lawmakers, including Malliotakis, have denounced the city’s sanctuary policies as a primary driver of the migrant crisis.

When reached for comment on Malliotakis' speech invitation, the White House referred Fox News Digital to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre's earlier condemnation of the attack.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.

Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.

Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.

Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.

The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.

The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was ""no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.""

Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.

Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.

Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.

""I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,"" Austin said at the time. ""I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden said Monday a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is close and hoped to see one materialize by ""the end of the weekend.""

The seemingly casual comments, carrying massive geopolitical significance, came during the president’s stop at an ice cream parlor near Peacock Network’s headquarters, where he had just wrapped up an interview with Seth Meyers on the ""Late Night"" show.

Asked by a reporter when he expected the ceasefire to begin, Biden, with a mint ice cream cone in hand, said he hoped by at least ""the end of the weekend.""

""At least, my national security advisor tells me that we’re close. We’re close. It’s not done yet,"" Biden said. ""And my hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a ceasefire.""

Biden also spoke about his planned trip to the southern border this Thursday where he will meet with border agents and discuss the need for bipartisan legislation.

Biden joked that ""my good friend"" would be making a border stop as well, a subtle nod to GOP rival, former President Trump, who is traveling to the border as well.

Biden's visit comes after the murder of Augusta University student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus in Athens last week allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant. Her murder has reinvigorated calls for Biden to take more stringent border measures.

The stop in Van Leeuwen came after a taped interview with Meyers, where dozens of pro-Palestinian activists were arrested for demonstrating in the lobby.

Negotiations are underway for a weekslong cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to allow for the release of hostages being held in Gaza by the Iranian-backed terrorist group in return for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The proposed six-week pause in fighting would also include allowing hundreds of trucks to deliver desperately needed aid into Gaza every day.

FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans have introduced legislation that would allow states to secure the border by constructing temporary border barriers along the southern and northern borders to stop the entry of illegal immigrants.

Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., is introducing the CONTAINER Act in the House – a bill that aims to give states the authority to build temporary barriers on federal land in an effort to stop illegal immigrants and drugs like fentanyl from entering into their states via the U.S.-Mexico border.

The bill is in response to legal battles that hit both Arizona and Texas over their efforts to secure the border with new barriers after border wall construction largely stopped when President Donald Trump left office.

BIDEN, DURING VISIT TO OVERWHELMED BORDER, URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK SENATE BILL: ‘TIME TO ACT'

In 2022, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, set up hundreds of double-stacked shipping containers across the border in an effort to stop illegal immigrants as numbers rose in his state. In 2023, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott installed wrecking-ball-sized buoys and razor wire along the Rio Grande as part of his Operation Lone Star.

Arizona’s barrier has since been removed. In December, a judge ordered Texas to remove its buoys in the Rio Grande, and a court battle between Texas and the Biden administration is ongoing after Texas sued the federal government for cutting the wire.

""Not only has the Biden Administration failed to enforce our laws and secure our border, but they have also barred border states from executing more robust border security measures,"" Rouzer said in a statement. ""No community is immune to the drugs, sex trafficking and crime these policies are incentivizing while enriching the cartels. This bill will give border states the explicit ability to erect physical barriers to protect not only their citizens, but all of America, from President Biden’s catastrophic open-border policies.""

Co-sponsors on the bill include House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R–Texas, and Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas.

""States like my home in Texas have the right to secure their borders when the White House refuses to do so,"" Pfluger said.

Companion legislation was previously introduced in the Senate by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who said last month that ""it’s clear Congress must act to give border states the explicit authority to protect their communities and the sovereignty of the United States.""

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Republicans have repeatedly called for border barrier construction as one of the ways to help secure the southern border. The House Republican border legislation, which passed the chamber last year, would restart border wall construction. However, it has not yet been taken up in the upper chamber.

The Biden administration has largely ended border wall construction, calling it ineffective. Some construction has continued where money has already been appropriated by Congress in previous fiscal years. It has also called for Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate border bill that does include some funding for border wall construction. But conservatives have warned that the legislation would normalize already-high levels of illegal immigration.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter Monday ahead of the government funding deadline later this week urging Republicans to reauthorize the federal radiation compensation policy.

The policy, known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), is on track to expire this spring. It was originally enacted in 1990 to compensate Americans exposed to radiation during the Manhattan Project and Cold War testing. While RECA has compensated many, there are still people awaiting claims, and certain affected groups have been overlooked, Hawley said.

""It is our duty to reauthorize and update RECA this spring. I emphasize that this is not a welfare program. It is a matter of basic justice for those the government poisoned,"" Hawley wrote in the letter. ""We’ve developed the most advanced nuclear weapons on earth, but we cannot forget the working people of this country who were sacrificed for it.""

BIDEN CALLS JOHNSON, SCHUMER FOR WHITE HOUSE MEETING AMID CONGRESSIONAL CHAOS STIRRING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FEARS

Hawley, a skeptic of additional funding to Ukraine, added, ""If we can send hundreds of billions of dollars in security assistance to foreign nations, we can spend a fraction of that on our own constituents who deserve help.""

Studies show that radiation from decades of mining, processing and enriching continues to permeate sites used during World War II and the Cold War.

In the 1940s, the U.S. was ramping up its military production to prepare for WWII, which included the government converting farmlands in Weldon Springs, Mo. into the Weldon Spring Chemical Plant. The plant produced a massive amount of TNT and DNT explosives for the war effort.

For Hawley, the issue hits close to home. In his home state of Missouri, nuclear waste was reportedly mishandled at one processing site, with leaky barrels left in the open air and contaminating a nearby creek where children have played for years. Hawley says in the letter many of those children have since developed cancer.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

""Tens of thousands of other Americans were exposed to radiation 'downwind' from over 100 atmospheric tests in western States,"" Hawley wrote. ""In most cases, nobody was warned of this danger. In others, the government simply lied. Repeatedly.""

But this could slow up the legislative process to approve government funding at the end of the week, as the upper chamber scrambles to pass full-year appropriations bills that would fund several federal agencies. The current temporary spending patch, known as a Continuing Resolution (CR), expires Friday and Congress will have to pass legislation by then to avert a partial government shutdown. The Senate has not introduced spending agreements yet for the remaining nine bills.

Hawley’s office told Fox News Digital it will seek to attach the RECA reauthorization to any legislative proposal that is likely to get signed into law.

This isn't the first time Hawley has tried to increase RECA's reauthorization chances by attaching it to any legislative vehicle that has a chance of passing. Last year, the Senate initially amended the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to include Hawley's RECA amendment, but it was later removed right before the package passed. Hawley's office has speculated it was removed due to cost.

Last year, some Republicans opposed a similar bill by Hawley that included RECA, arguing it would cost $100 billion over the course of a decade. Hawley proceeded to revise that portion of the bill and slashed the multi-billion dollar price tag, but his colleagues were still not convinced.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has opposed the proposal to reauthorize RECA, citing a commitment to shrink the federal deficit.

The Border Patrol union issued a fiery warning on Thursday to President Biden, telling him to ""keep our name out of your mouth,"" hours before the president is due to meet with officials at the border and urge passage of a Senate border bill.

Biden and former President Donald Trump are both heading to the border, with Biden visiting Brownsville, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders.

""During his trip, the President will receive a briefing on border security operations and an operational briefing from CBP, ICE, and USCIS. Afterwards, the President will deliver remarks to emphasize the need for Congressional Republicans to stop putting politics ahead of our border security and pass the bipartisan border security agreement,"" a White House official said.

BORDER PATROL UNION SLAMS BIDEN BORDER VISIT AS ‘TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE’ JUST TO ‘TRY TO SAVE HIMSELF’

That bipartisan bill, which includes additional staffing for Border Patrol and other agencies, as well as funding for cities and states receiving migrants and limits on asylum, won the backing of the union. Conservative lawmakers, however, rejected the bill and said it would normalize unacceptably high levels of illegal immigration and the bill has not progressed.

While it backed the bipartisan bill that Biden also supports, the National Border Patrol Council has otherwise been intensely critical of the Biden administration’s handling of the border crisis and put that in no uncertain terms in a post on X.

""Attention President Biden: Keep our name out of your mouth today,"" it said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on the post.

The union had issued a statement this week, calling the visit ""too little, too late.""

DUELING BIDEN, TRUMP VISITS TO BESIEGED BORDER COME AMID FRESH SLEW OF VIOLENT CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""But even if he were to put the proper policies in place at this late hour, he’d be doing it only to try to save his Presidency. And self-serving actions when time is winding down should always give Americans pause. Common sense dictates that as a lame duck, he’d revert to his open border policies if re-elected,"" the union said.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

""Biden is going to the border now solely to try to save himself. Border security should never be about politics, it should always be about the safety and security of this great nation and the American people,"" it said.

The trip comes as illegal immigration has become a top election issue, with polls showing a majority of voters see it as a critical threat to the country.

President Biden will seek to put the ball in the Republicans’ camp, repeating the administration’s argument that it is working within a ""broken"" system that needs funding and reforms from Congress. The White House has also pointed to a record of over 550,000 removals since May last year, more than any year since FY 23.

What's Happening?

- Fani Willis' disqualification hearing happening Friday afternoon…

- DC voters make their presidential primary pick…

- Harris' shrinking role in migrant crisis

Where was the VP?

President Biden visited the southern border in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday, and was joined by a number of top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but Vice President Kamala Harris was not among them.

Biden spoke in Brownsville after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He urged Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that he believes will help solve the raging crisis at the southern border.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

But the vice president, who was tasked in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration, was not there.

A year ago, Harris announced an additional $950 million in response to the Call to Action, bringing in a total of more than $4.2 billion since May 2021. But since then, her public role only appears to have continually shrunk, even amid a historic year for illegal immigration, with more than 2.4 million migrant encounters in FY 23. FY 24 has been similarly overwhelming, with over 300,000 encounters in December.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

Biden spoke in Brownsville, Texas, after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He began by addressing recent wildfires in Texas and Oklahoma, and linking them to climate change.

BORDER PATROL UNION TELLS BIDEN TO ‘KEEP OUR NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH’ AHEAD OF TEXAS VISIT

The visit, which coincided with former President Donald Trump's visit to the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, comes as illegal immigration has become a major 2024 election issue and remains a thorny issue for the administration. Polls show that more than half of Americans think large numbers of illegal immigrants entering the U.S. represents a critical threat to the country.

The crisis, now into its third year, has smashed multiple records with more than 2.4 million encounters in FY 23 and over 300,000 in December alone — breaking the record for monthly encounters.

President Biden and his administration have sought to shift the blame for the crisis onto the shoulders of Republicans. The administration says that it is working with a broken system that needs significantly more funding and comprehensive immigration reform. It introduced a bill on Biden's first day in office that included a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants already in the U.S., which was immediately rejected by Republicans.

Republicans in the House introduced and passed legislation of their own that would fund more Border Patrol agents, resume wall construction, restart the Remain-in-Mexico policy and severely limit the ability of migrants to claim asylum.

After the White House made a supplemental funding request, including $20 billion for border funding in late 2023, Senate negotiators hashed out a deal that included additional staffing at the border and in asylum offices, an increased $1.4 billion in funding to cities and NGOs receiving migrants, took action to tackle fentanyl smuggling and would limit asylum claims. It would also increase detention beds to 50,000 and provide additional immigration judges.

DUELING BIDEN, TRUMP VISITS TO BESIEGED BORDER COME AMID FRESH SLEW OF VIOLENT CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""Folks, the bipartisan border security bill is a win for the American people and a win for the people of Texas, and it's fair for those who legitimately have a right to come here,"" Biden said.

""The U.S. Senate need to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits, not on whether it's going to benefit one party or another party,"" he said, also calling for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to put it on the floor in the House.

However, it has failed to gain enough support in the Senate, as conservative lawmakers have warned that a limiting mechanism that only comes into place after an average of 5,000 encounters a day would normalize already-high levels of illegal immigration.

Biden said, however, that it was ""the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.""

He also appealed to his predecessor to back the bill.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

""I understand my predecessor is in Eagle Pass today — here’s what I would say to Mr. Trump,"" Biden said. ""Join me, or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together.""

Republicans in the House, who have recently impeached DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, say Biden doesn’t need additional congressional action to secure the border and can do so with the tools his administration already has.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Speaking to Fox News Digital ahead of the speech, GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., dismissed Biden’s trip as a photo op, and called it ""another sign of Biden’s incompetence.""

""It's just going to be another cleaned up photo op. It's not going to be any actual confrontation of the crisis that this guy created. Time and time again, Joe Biden proves that he cares more about minimizing the political implications of this issue than actually addressing it. So I don't expect much is going to come out of it, except the American people are going to realize once again that Joe Biden doesn't really mean business when it comes to the border,"" he said.

Emmer said that to solve the crisis, Biden needs to tackle the five issues that were in the House GOP bill: end catch and release, reform parole authority, finish the wall, reform asylum and restore Remain-in-Mexico, which kept migrants in Mexico for the duration of their hearings.

Emmer, like others in the House GOP caucus, was dismissive of the contents of the Senate bill that Biden is promoting.

""You're going to make it law now that he can let in up to 5,000 a day before it becomes a shutdown situation? Outrageous. And the fact that anybody even reports it as an option, I think is less than responsible,"" he said. ""You’ve got to do something in the five areas that the House has already addressed, but the bare minimum is to restore Remain in Mexico.""

In the Senate, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., called the speech a ""half-hearted attempt to pay lip service to the crisis his policies have caused.""

""President Biden can fix this crisis, and I hope his visit is the wakeup call he needs to use the authority he already has to build the border wall, reinstate Title 42, and end catch-and-release, so that we can finally secure our border, uphold our national security, and keep Americans safe,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on President Biden to debate former President Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner, arguing that the president could ""beat"" Trump like he did in 2020.

""Biden beat Trump in the prior debates. I look forward to it,"" the California Democrat said during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.

The comment comes as Biden has so far refused to commit to debate Trump, who has a commanding lead in the Republican presidential primary race. Trump, on the other hand, has called on the president to debate him ""immediately,"" arguing such an event would be ""for the good of the country.""

'THE VIEW' HOSTS CLASH OVER WHETHER BIDEN SHOULD DEBATE TRUMP, WORRY PRESIDENT 'CAN LOSE'

Trump's desire to debate Biden comes despite his refusal to appear for debates against GOP primary foes, something Newsom argued Sunday was ""weakness masquerading as strength.""

""This is... pure projection on a guy who refused to debate in his own primary,"" Newsom said.

But not everyone believes Biden has much to gain by debating Trump ahead of this year's election, with the topic recently becoming the subject of a heated debate between the co-hosts of ""The View"" earlier this week.

BIDEN IS LYING LOW AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL AS COMMENTATORS WORRY THAT HE IS SEEN AS ‘NOT IN CONTROL’ OF THE NATION

Co-host Sara Haines had particularly strong feelings on the topic, warning that only Trump would benefit from the two candidates squaring off.

""Biden can lose, he can lose in a debate,"" Haines said. ""Trump will not. The people supporting Trump will support him whether he’s there or not. Biden makes one mistake, and the people who are undecided are out.""

Newsom's comments also come as speculation about his desire to jump into the race have continued to swirl, something the California governor said Sunday was off the table.

""I am here celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration,"" Newsom said, calling the continued speculation about his potential run ""idle chat"" and a ""sideshow.""

""It's not even an interesting conversation,"" Newsom continued. ""I think it's a damning conversation, frankly, the other side wants us to have… they love ginning this stuff up.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The budget office attributed the improved outlook to higher tax collections, noting significant gains in corporate tax revenues.

Minnesota's budget outlook has improved, officials said Thursday, with a slightly bigger surplus forecast for the current budget that will give the Legislature a little more breathing room this session.

Minnesota Management and Budget said the current two-year budget period, which runs through June 2025, is now expected to end with a surplus of just over $3.7 billion.

""The near-term economic outlook has improved, with growth expected to persist through 2027,"" the budget office said, citing higher tax collections. Corporate tax revenues are showing the largest gains due to higher-than-expected corporate profits.

The budget office is also forecasting a smaller potential deficit for the next two-year budget, which begins in July 2025.

Among those who are being floated as a potential replacement for the leadership position are senators John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; Rick Scott R-Fla.; Tom Cotton, R-Ark.; and Steve Daines, R-Mont.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced in a floor speech Wednesday he will step down from leadership in November. The Kentucky Republican is the Senate's longest-serving party leader in history.

Speculation about Thune, Barrasso or Daines taking over as leader stems from their current roles in GOP leadership. They serve as Republican whip, Senate Republican Conference chairman and National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, respectively.

MITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER

""Chairman Daines is laser-focused on taking back the Senate majority,"" NRSC communications director Mike Berg told Fox News Digital.

One source familiar with Senate Republican conference discussions shared that the ""three Johns"" — Thune, Cornyn and Barrasso — are not of the same political stripe. Barrasso is considered the most conservative out of the three, the source said. Barrasso is also believed to be a more palatable option for the various factions of Republicans in the Senate who don't always see eye to eye. He notably endorsed former President Trump early last month.

SEN. COTTON PROBES DOD HOW US AIRMAN WHO LIT HIMSELF ON FIRE WAS 'ALLOWED TO SERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY'

""What I'm focused on is the election,"" Barrasso told reporters shortly after McConnell's announcement.

As for decisions regarding leadership, he said, ""I'm going to talk to members of the conference, hear what they have to say, listen to them in terms of what direction that they want to take with us.""

Both Cornyn and Thune also endorsed Trump after Barrasso. Thune had initially endorsed fellow Sen. Tim Scott R-S.C., who ultimately dropped out and endorsed Trump.

Sen. Rick Scott was more pointed in his statement following McConnell's surprise announcement, saying in a statement, ""I have been very clear and have long believed that we need new leadership in the Senate that represents our voters and the issues we were sent here to fight for.""

When Scott challenged McConnell for the position, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told reporters McConnell received 37 votes from conference members, while Scott received 10. One Republican voted ""present."" Some of those who reportedly voted against McConnell were senators Josh Hawley, R-Mo; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Braun; Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who supported Scott in 2022, would welcome Scott's leadership if he were to take over, a staffer in Lee's office told Fox News Digital.

MCCONNELL SAYS SENATE TRIAL FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT IS THE 'BEST WAY FORWARD'

The source also shared that Cotton was being mentioned as a potential contender for the position. Cotton's office couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Cornyn, who does not hold a leadership position in the GOP and is poised to launch a potential bid for leader, said in a statement Wednesday that ""today is about Mitch McConnell.""

""But I've made no secret about my intentions,"" he added.

Cornyn on his timeline: ""Not today.""

Cornyn also endorsed former President Trump to be the Republican presidential nominee, and some lawmakers have begun looking to the likely GOP candidate for guidance about who should replace McConnell.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told reporters Wednesday the next person ""absolutely"" needs to have a more positive relationship with Trump, adding, ""He's going to be the next president, we have to work together.""

Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., agreed.

""It's so important that the next leader have a very positive relationship with the president,"" Marshall told Fox News Digital in an interview Wednesday. ""I think that this next leader needs to have a little bit more, maybe a lot more of a populist view.""

Marshall, who positioned himself alongside conservative hardliners who were critical of McConnell and voted against the bipartisan border deal in the national security supplemental package this month, added that the names being floated for leadership have been ""interviewing for the job since I got here.""

""I watch how they vote. I watch what their priorities are. I've been watching their volume on what issues they're championing,"" he said. ""All the names … have great qualities.

AFP Action, the conservative wing of the powerful and influential conservative Americans for Prosperity, funded by the billionaire Koch Brothers, has pulled funding for the presidential campaign of Nikki Haley.

In an email to staffers obtained by Fox News, AFP Action senior adviser Emily Seidel said the group did not believe that ""any outside group can make a material difference to widen [Haley’s] path to victory.""

""And so while we will continue to endorse her, we will focus our resources where we can make the difference. And that’s the U.S. Senate and House,"" Seidel wrote.

The news was first reported by Politico earlier Sunday.

AFP Action endorsed Haley in November, giving her a major grassroots and organizational boost.

The deep-pocketed fiscally conservative network launched an ad blitz on behalf of Haley in January, including mailers, digital ads, and connected TV spots.

AFP Action, which pledged to spend tens of millions of dollars to help push the Republican Party past former President Trump as it endorsed Haley in late November, said last month it was putting an initial $27 million behind this new wave in their ongoing campaign.

TOP HIGHLIGHTS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA'S GOP PRIMARY WHERE TRUMP WON BIG, HALEY VOWED TO PRESS ON

The news came after Haley’s GOP rival, former President Trump, won the GOP primary in Haley’s home state of South Carolina on Saturday.

Despite the loss, and defying calls to exit the race, Haley has said it’s not the ""end of our story"" as she traveled Sunday to Michigan ahead of the state’s primary on Tuesday.

In the less than 24 hours following her Saturday night loss, Haley's campaign said that she had raised $1 million ""from grassroots supporters alone,"" Fox News previously reported.

EUROPEAN NATIONS HAVE TO START PAYING UP: DONALD TRUMP

Haley's campaign argued that the money raised ""demonstrates Haley's staying power and her appeal to broad swaths of the American public.""

Asked Sunday about losing funding from AFP Action, Haley said she was ""not worried.""

""Americans for Prosperity was an amazing partner. They strongly believe in freedom. They believe in limited government. They believe in all the things that I, as a conservative, believe. And they've been fantastic through these states,"" Haley said, vowing to continue fighting ""for the 70% of Americans that don't want to see a Trump-Biden rematch.""

With his win Saturday in the first-in-the South contest, Trump has now swept every primary or caucus on the GOP early-season calendar that awards delegates. His performances have left little maneuvering room for Haley, his former U.N. ambassador.

The Border Patrol union mocked President Biden on Saturday for his trip to the Texas border this week.

""Board AF1, take nap. Wake up in place called Brownsville,"" the union wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in a joke itinerary of his day, along with a photo of Biden resting in a beach lounge chair. ""Read large teleprompter message, ‘It's all Trump's fault.’ Board AF1, ask who people in green uniforms were, told they ‘strap’ illegal aliens, express horror, take nap. Wake up, call a lid, hit beach, take nap.""

While in Brownsville on Thursday, Biden lamented that the bipartisan immigration bill failed to pass in the Senate, blaming Trump for using it as a political issue. Many Republicans have expressed their opposition to the bill, which they say doesn't do enough.

""The majority of Democrats and Republicans in both houses support this legislation,"" Biden said in Brownsville, ""until someone came along and said don't do that that'll benefit the incumbent. That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.""

WATCH: BORDER PATROL UNION CHIEF EXPLODES ON BIDEN IN FIERY PRESS CONFERENCE, SAYS AGENTS ‘P----D’ AT POLICIES

The president faces increasing scrutiny over his handling of the border as the Border Patrol continues to report a record number of migrant encounters.

In December alone, there were more than 300,000 encounters – an all-time record.

The issue also threatens to hurt Biden politically ahead of November’s presidential election.

Trump was also at the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday which he said is ""being overrun by the Biden migrant crime,"" invoking the murder of Georgia student Laken Riley allegedly by a Venezuelan migrant last week.

BIDEN, TRUMP MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" Trump said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Biden and his administration have sought to shift the blame for the crisis onto the shoulders of Republicans. The administration says that it is working with a broken system that needs significantly more funding and comprehensive immigration reform. It introduced a bill on Biden's first day in office that included a mass amnesty for millions of migrants already in the U.S., which was immediately rejected by Republicans.

Republicans in the House introduced and passed legislation of their own that would fund more Border Patrol agents, resume wall construction, restart the Remain-in-Mexico policy and severely limit the ability of migrants to claim asylum.

The Border Patrol union frequently mocks the president over illegal immigration.

The organization wrote in part on X on Friday, ""Wasn't it Biden who encouraged people from all over the world to ‘surge the border’? Didn't Biden immediately void all the successful Trump EO's that were keeping our border under control? Didn't he publicly and viciously accuse BP agents of criminal assault, then told the world ‘those people will pay’, and the entire thing was made up BS? Has he apologized or taken responsibility for any of it, or asked forgiveness from the victims of some of the millions of illegal aliens he imported into this country?""

And before Biden went to the border, the group posted, ""Attention President Biden: Keep our name out of your mouth today.""

The murder of a Georgia nursing student allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested in New York City is the ""direct result"" of recent New York City laws that severed ties between the NYPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Republican Councilman Joe Borelli argued.

""It is a direct result of the City Council passing legislation that limits cooperation. If those laws were not enacted, the Department of Corrections would have given ICE the opportunity to issue a detainer against Jose Ibarra,"" Borelli told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week.

Georgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 22, was discovered beaten to death earlier this month after going for a run on the University of Georgia’s campus. The Augusta University student crossed paths with illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra, according to authorities, and died from blunt force trauma to the head.

Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was granted border ""parole,"" which allows noncitizens to temporarily enter the country due to an emergency or humanitarian reason, authorities have said. Ibarra soon made his way up to New York City, where he was arrested in August and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,"" according to ICE.

7.2M ILLEGALS ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

The NYPD, however, has said it does not have a record of Ibarra's arrest.

Typically, when ICE learns an illegal immigrant is arrested on criminal charges, the agency will issue a detainer that requests the local police department hold the suspect until ICE can take over and begin deportation proceedings.

In Ibarra’s case, ICE said he was released by the NYPD before a detainer could be issued.

New York City, however, is a ""sanctuary city"" with relatively recent laws passed by City Council severing many ties between the NYPD and ICE.

""A woman is dead in Georgia because the New York City Council passed local laws barring the NYPD from cooperating with ICE, and as such the suspect was released without any notification to federal law enforcement,"" Borelli tweeted this week, accompanied by a list of laws that restricted local cooperation with the immigration agency.

Under a pair of 2014 laws, the local Department of Corrections and NYPD were restricted from complying with ICE detainers under certain conditions. The DOC, for example, is only allowed to comply with an ICE detainer if it is accompanied by a warrant from a federal judge and if the suspect has been convicted of a violent crime in the last five years.

""Our city is not served when New Yorkers with strong ties in the community are afraid to engage with law enforcement because they fear deportation. Today, we send another message to Washington that the time to act has come to provide relief to so many individuals who contribute to our nation’s growth,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said when the two laws were enacted.

""I’d like to thank Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the City Council for passing this legislation, which further establishes New York City as a leader in immigration reform.""

Similar reforms continued under the de Blasio administration, including in 2017, when the City Council passed a bill prohibiting ""City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law.""

""The de Blasio Administration today announced the issuance of citywide guidance and new NYPD protocols to clarify and institutionalize the City’s policy that it will not voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities, and will only coordinate in limited circumstances, including where there is a public safety risk,"" a press release from the de Blasio administration stated of the law at the start of 2018.

Borelli, who has served on City Council representing portions of Staten Island since 2015, argued ""it's interesting to see people trying to backtrack on the impact that these laws have on the cooperation between ICE and city law enforcement.""

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""But the proof is in the pudding,"" he said.

The New York Republican pointed to comments made by local politicians when the laws were passed, arguing that Democrats wanted to sever communication between local law enforcement and federal authorities when involving illegal immigrants.

""The day we start helping ICE is the day we lose the public trust, which is why this guidance and protocol is so critical,"" a former NYC council member said in 2018, when de Blasio announced the prohibition of city agencies partnering with the Department of Homeland Security when related to immigration laws.

Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams also supported the measure in 2018, when he served as Brooklyn borough president.

""It is important for our police officers and City employees to have clear guidance and protocol on how to interact with federal immigration enforcement, especially considering the overaggressive behavior of ICE agents. Public safety for all of our residents must come first,"" Adams said, according to the de Blasio-era press release.

Following Laken Riley’s murder, Adams said this week that he supports altering city laws that would open the doors to New York City officials working with federal authorities on immigration matters involving violent suspects or repeat offenders.

""I want to go back to the standards of the previous mayors who I believe subscribed to my belief that people who are suspected of committing serious crimes in this city should be held accountable,"" Adams told reporters at City Hall Tuesday.

""We should not be allowing people who are repeatedly committing crimes to remain here, and we cannot collaborate with ICE in the process,"" the mayor added.

Adams has repeatedly spoken out in support of keeping New York City as a sanctuary city, saying illegal immigrants in the Big Apple should not live in fear of receiving city services, such as attending a school, due to their immigration status.

When asked about Borelli's comments and the laws passed by City Council under his administration, de Blasio told Fox News Digital in a statement that it's time for ""tougher border policies.""

""I trust the NYPD, and they say they never encountered the accused individual. But it’s sickening that a young, promising life was cut short. Any way you slice it, we need tougher border policies and comprehensive immigration reform,"" de Blasio said.

The former mayor also pointed Fox Digital to an opinion piece he wrote this month, in which he proposed accepting ""Republican demands for greater border security in exchange for full funding of a humane and functioning asylum process,"" along with ""spending billions to create the facilities necessary on the Mexican side of the border, including the concessions and incentives the Mexican government would require in order to accept this plan.""

Borelli argued the push by the City Council to sever ties with federal authorities back when de Blasio was in office evolved from Democrats in the city wanting to resist what they saw as a ""Trump agenda"" on immigration.

""This was a reaction by the de Blasio administration and the City Council to push back on what they saw as the Trump agenda. And as long as they were doing what they could to oppose Trump, they didn't care,"" he said.

Borelli said the local legislation is now backfiring as New Yorkers and others question the laws’ logic.

""It's completely backfired when people start to question, ‘What is the logic of having people who are here illegally in the first place, and then commit crimes against New Yorkers and others?’ There's limited rationale for keeping them here, even if you were a progressive who is sympathetic to people coming here in the first place,"" Borelli said.

Laken Riley’s murder has shocked many Americans and heightened outrage about the Biden administration’s border policies. More than 7 million illegal immigrants have flooded the nation since President Biden took office in 2021, a figure larger than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News Digital analysis previously found.

Riley was reportedly so badly beaten during the murder that her skull was disfigured, investigators reported in an affidavit.

""He’s a sick puppy,"" Borelli told Fox Digital when asked about the brutal attack. ""[He] would not have withstood screening, we hope, if we had a proper system of vetting and deporting people.""

Ibarra is in custody and was charged with the felonies of malice murder, murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and concealing the death of another, as well as the misdemeanor of physically hindering a 911 call, according to the affidavit filed Feb. 23.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER: MEDIA OUTLETS FOCUS ON LONE JOGGERS, DOWNPLAY SUSPECTED KILLER’S IMMIGRATION STATUS

New York State Senate Republicans on Wednesday announced the renaming of legislation that would allow local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE. The legislation will now be known as ""Laken's Law"" in memory of Riley.

""Because of New York law, because of New York sanctuary state laws, local law enforcement do not notify federal immigration officials when they take someone into custody, even if they're here — especially when they're here illegally,"" Republican New York state Sen. Robert Ortt said at a press conference Wednesday.

""So, Laken Riley's murderer, albeit an alleged murderer, was in custody, law enforcement custody, and he was released without notification to ICE, to federal authorities, because of policies and laws passed by Democrats here in New York State,""

Montgomery County officials met with ICE’s Baltimore Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to discuss cooperation on Tuesday. In a statement, county officials said there was a ""productive discussion"" between County Executive Marc Elrich and Baltimore Field Office Director Darius Reeves ""about improved communications and operational challenges with custody transfers."" An ICE official told Fox News Digital that a dialogue had been opened on honoring detainers and they were looking forward to a mutually beneficial arrangement.

ICE lodges detainers against illegal immigrants who are brought into local police custody when ICE believes them to be deportable. Those detainers request that the police notify ICE when they are about to be released and sometimes hold them for a limited additional time so that ICE can take them safely into federal custody and act to remove them.

However, ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions refuse to honor such detainers. Montgomery County claims it is not a sanctuary county, and that it works with ICE in their work on ""immigration and customs violations and drug and human trafficking."" Elrich said on a press call on Wednesday that the county does honor some detainers when an illegal immigrant is convicted of violent crimes.

Despite that claim, ICE says no detainers have been honored in the county in either the last fiscal year or this one. Director Reeves told Fox News Digital this week that in FY 2023, ICE issued 198 detainers, none of which were honored. So far in FY 2024, the agency has issued 119 detainers and none have been honored by the county.

He said those included illegal immigrants with convictions for assault, robbery, illegal firearm possession, sex abuse of a minor, rape and other sex offenses. He also said there was at least one MS-13 gang member among those whom ICE had requested, but they had been rebuffed by the county.

In the state of Maryland as a whole, the agency arrested 152 sex offenders in FY23. He said the counties that do not honor detainers – which he said includes Montgomery County – account for 46% of at-large sex offender arrests.

On Tuesday, ICE told Fox 5 that a Salvadoran national charged this week with the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland had been arrested twice in Montgomery County and released both times despite ICE lodging a detainer. Elrich said his initial arrests were for theft and were not on the list of violent crimes that would have resulted in him being turned over to ICE.

Reeves says ICE will go into the community and locate many of those illegal aliens, and brought them into custody, but stressed that releasing them onto the streets poses a threat to both ICE agents and the public.

""Any at-large operation like that, it's just an inherent risk and risk to the officer and risk to the subject of our arrest and it's a risk to normal day-to-day citizens that happen upon the scene,"" he said.

""The most violent of folks potentially have weapons on them. You can have incidents where… they take off in their vehicles and crash into other folks. It's just a whole host of issues that would not occur if the detainers were being honored. We could come to the jails and we can take them out of the jails in a safe environment and move them toward their immigration hearings.""

He also stressed that it is not a major burden on state and local jurisdictions.

VENEZUELAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST 14-YEAR-OLD IN VIRGINIA

""We're not asking any of these jurisdictions that are unwilling to cooperate to hold anyone for us beyond the 48 hours after their state release. What we are asking is to have advance notice of 48 hours so we can have the resources made available to pick up these individuals and in a very safe manner,"" he said.

In 2021, the Biden administration implemented significantly narrowed ICE enforcement priorities, limiting ICE to recent border crossers, national security threats and public safety threats. So Reeves stressed that the illegal immigrants they are typically targeting are normally serious criminals.

""We are focused on egregious offenders, major public safety threats and, national security threats. We are not focused on the single mother, migrant mother who happens to steal diapers or formula from the local bodega to feed her children. We are interested in guns. We're interested in sex trafficking, human trafficking, violence, rape, murderers, gangs. Those are the people that we're concentrating on.""

In its statement, the county said the meeting is one of a number of such meetings, and the two sides will be meeting again in the coming weeks.

""The County cleared up some misconceptions about our policy on immigration enforcement (ie Montgomery County is not a sanctuary county) and ICE underscored their need for more notice prior to releases,"" the statement said.

""Director Reeves offered resources and training for our Department of Corrections staff and the County shared our policy on notification to allow ICE to provide feedback,"" the statement said.

The meeting comes as ""sanctuary"" policies have come into focus after a number of high-profile crimes have been committed by illegal aliens after they have been previously arrested and then turned back onto the streets despite an ICE detainer lodged against them. In New York City, one of the most high-profile sanctuary cities, Mayor Eric Adams said this week that sanctuary laws need to be modified to turn migrants who have committed felonies over to ICE.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The first son is expected to take questions from lawmakers and congressional investigators behind closed doors before the House Oversight and Judiciary committees.

The deposition was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.

Hunter Biden's expected testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Tony Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

He added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

Also last week, congressional investigators heard testimony from a former business associate of Hunter's — Jason Galanis, who is serving a 14-year prison sentence. Galanis testified during a rare transcribed interview from an Alabama prison that Joe Biden was allegedly considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.

Joe Biden's involvement would bring ""political access in the United States and around the world,"" he claimed.

JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES

Hunter Biden was first subpoenaed to appear for a closed-door deposition in November. The deposition was slated for Dec. 13, but the first son defied the subpoena. Instead of appearing to testify, he held a press conference on Capitol Hill during which he defended himself and his father, saying the president ""was not financially involved in my business.""

Ahead of his subpoenaed deposition, Hunter Biden had offered to testify in a public setting.

Comer and Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, rejected his request, noting that the first son would not have special treatment and pointing to the dozens of other witnesses who have appeared as compelled for their interviews and depositions. Comer and Jordan vowed to release the transcript of Hunter Biden’s deposition.

But after he defied the subpoena, the committees in January passed resolutions to hold the first son in contempt of Congress for defying the congressional subpoena. Before those resolutions were able to be considered by the House Rules Committee and the full House, Hunter Biden’s attorneys offered to discuss scheduling a new deposition for the first son — something House Republicans were willing to do.

HUNTER BIDEN DEPOSITION SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH AFTER RISK OF BEING HELD IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS

The president’s son’s deposition comes after years of congressional investigations into his business dealings, beginning in September 2019 in the Senate. That investigation was led by senators Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis.

Hunter Biden’s business dealings and foreign relationships came under heightened scrutiny in the fall of 2019 during the first impeachment of former President Trump.

Trump was impeached after a July 2019 phone call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine, specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings and Joe Biden’s successful effort to have former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin ousted.

FLASHBACK: GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SHARE HUNTER BIDEN'S CHINA-LINKED BANK RECORDS WITH US ATTORNEY LEADING CRIMINAL PROBE

Hunter Biden was quietly under federal investigation, beginning in 2018, at the time of the call, a probe prompted by suspicious foreign transactions.

Trump's request was regarded by Democrats as a quid pro quo because millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen. Democrats also said Trump was meddling in the 2020 presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a Democratic political opponent.

Republicans had been investigating Hunter Biden’s business dealings, specifically with regard to Burisma Holdings. House Republicans, who were in the minority at the time, made several requests to subpoena Hunter Biden for testimony and documents related to the impeachment of Trump and his business dealings that fell at the center of the proceedings.

FLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE

Biden has acknowledged that when he was vice president he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, and Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board, receiving thousands of dollars per month. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion of critical U.S. aid at the time if Shokin was not fired.

""I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion.' … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,’"" Biden recalled telling then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Biden recalled the conversation during an event for the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

""Well, son of a b----, he got fired,"" Biden said during the event. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

Biden allies maintain he pushed for Shokin's firing when he was vice president due to concerns the Ukrainian prosecutor went easy on corruption, and they say that his firing, at the time, was the policy position of the U.S. and international community.

FLASHBACK: HUNTER BIDEN 'TAX AFFAIRS' UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION; LINKS TO CHINA FUNDS EMERGE, SOURCES SAY

Now, as part of the impeachment inquiry, Republicans are investigating any involvement Joe Biden had in his son’s business dealings.

Last year, the federal investigation into Hunter Biden that began in 2018 also came under heightened scrutiny when two IRS whistleblowers claimed politics were influencing prosecutorial decisions throughout the years-long probe.

Those allegations sparked congressional investigations and, ultimately, the impeachment inquiry. They also put pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to give then-U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware David Weiss special counsel authority.

WEISS SAYS HE 'WASN'T GRANTED' SPECIAL ATTORNEY AUTHORITY IN HUNTER BIDEN PROBE DESPITE REQUEST: TRANSCRIPT

Special counsel Weiss indicted the first son on federal gun charges in Delaware last year. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges. His attorneys are attempting to have that case dismissed.

Also last year, Weiss charged Biden with nine federal tax charges, which break down to three felonies and six misdemeanors for $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid.

Weiss charged Hunter Biden in December, alleging a ""four-year scheme"" in which the president's son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.

A group of Democrats who started a movement in opposition to President Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza sent a clear message in the Michigan primary, exceeding the amount of votes the group was aiming for and complicating the key battleground state ahead of this year's general election.

""Yesterday was a resounding victory,"" Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who joined the ""Listen to Michigan"" movement, said during a news conference Wednesday claiming victory for the movement.

The comments come following the movement's push to have Democratic voters select ""uncommitted"" in Tuesday's Democratic primary surpassed the group's expectations, with just over 101,000 people selecting the option, according to Associated Press numbers as of Wednesday afternoon. That mark was more than 10 times the group's stated goal, which was to get 10,000 people, or roughly the same as the margin of victory in the 2016 election in the state, to select the option.

POLL SHOWS BIDEN'S LEAD OVER TRUMP SHRINKING IN 2024 MATCHUP AS CONCERNS OVER PHYSICAL FITNESS GROW

Despite the apparent resounding success, Biden easily captured the state and gained 115 delegates while hauling in over 81% of the vote, further solidifying his grasp on the nomination and setting up a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in November.

""I want to thank every Michigander who made their voice heard today. Exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy is what makes America great,"" Biden said in a statement after the Michigan victory while warning that there is ""much left to do"" to defeat Trump in November. ""You’ve heard me say many times it’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of America. It’s never a good bet to bet against Michiganders either. This fight for our freedoms, for working families, and for Democracy is going to take all of us coming together. I know that we will.""

Meanwhile, Listen to Michigan supporters have warned they are willing to continue growing the movement ahead of the general election, a potential headache for the Biden campaign in a battleground state that has seen close margins in the last two presidential elections.

JAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER 'UNCOMMITTED' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: 'HUGE PROBLEM'

Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a Biden campaign spokesperson noted that the share of uncommitted votes, 11%, was actually in line with the previous time an incumbent was on the ballot in the state in a Democratic primary, which was during the 2012 re-election campaign of Former President Barack Obama. Nevertheless, the spokesperson stressed that the campaign is still working hard to earn the votes of holdouts and will continue working towards peace in Gaza.

But the movement started by Listen to Michigan may not be in Biden's rearview mirror after Michigan, with the group saying activists in future primary states have reached out about joining the cause.

""Two of the states where organizers have reached out specifically are Minnesota and Washington State,"" a Listen to Michigan spokesperson said during Wednesday's news conference. ""We have our eye on those states… and are ready to have conversations with anybody organizing for an anti-war future.""

The organization has also brushed off suggestions that it may at least indirectly help Trump regain the presidency, arguing that it is up to Biden to earn their votes.

""We are not electing Donald Trump. President Biden is the one seeking the highest office, and he is the candidate who's facing off against Donald Trump,"" Hammoud said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said Thursday the brother of the suspect charged with the murder of Georgia student Laken Riley was arrested multiple times in Athens, Georgia, in 2023, but its requests to take him into custody were ignored.

Diego Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, was arrested last week and charged with green card fraud.

His younger brother, Jose, is charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another in the homicide of Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student.

The two brothers from Venezuela were living in the United States illegally. ICE confirmed Jose's illegal status earlier this week.

In a statement Thursday, ICE said Diego Ibarra had first entered the U.S. April 3, 2023, near Eagle Pass, Texas, but was removed via the COVID-era Title 42 process. He reentered April 30 and was enrolled into ""Alternatives to Detention,"" by which migrants are monitored via GPS tracking when released.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

He was released May 12, 2023, but by May 25 was judged to have bolted from the program after abnormalities with his GPS tracking device. Enrollees can be tracked in a number of ways, including a bracelet or a cell phone app. Last year, the administration pushed for a reduction in ICE detention beds and more funding for ATD but is now pushing for more detention beds.

The ICE statement said he has several arrests in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, but that ICE detainers — requests that ICE be notified when an illegal immigrant is being released for a transfer to ICE custody — were not honored.

The Athens-Clarke County Police Department told Fox News Digital it is not responsible for ICE notifications and does not have access to immigration status. It said that is instead handled by the Clarke County jail and directed Fox to the Clarke County Sheriff’s office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why the detainers were not honored.

The revelation comes a day after Athens Mayor Kelly Girtz repeatedly rejected the characterization Athens is a ""sanctuary"" city.

""There's been no legislation from this government that’s created sanctuary city status,"" he said.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Fox reported this week that Diego Ibarra was fired from the University of Georgia after it was discovered he presented a fake green card to work at the school's dining hall.

""Diego Ibarra presented a fake green card to the hiring unit to begin a temporary position as a dishwasher in Bolton Dining Hall at the University of Georgia on Feb. 6, 2024,"" UGA spokesperson Greg Trevor told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Diego then failed to ""submit further documentation required to keep the job and was never paid by the university"" before he was ""fired,"" Trevor added.

The White House on Wednesday issued a statement to Fox News Digital calling on local governments to work with ICE on deporting violent criminals.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities.

""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the southwest border. (The) 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013.""

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is urging the Department of Defense (DOD) to share information about the agency's contract with a Chinese-owned financial corporation that provides tutoring services for U.S. military families.

On Thursday, Cotton sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calling the business relationship with Hong Kong-based Primavera Capital Group ""ill advised, reckless,"" and a danger to U.S. national security.

Primavera, the capital group associated with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, owns the tutoring service Tutor.com and has provided critical funding to the TikTok giant.

""We should not be giving the Chinese communists access to the data of United States servicemembers and their families,"" Cotton, a member of the Senate's intelligence committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""I look forward to a full explanation from the Department of Defense on their continued use of Tutor.com.""

Like ByteDance and any other Chinese tech company, Primavera is subject to Chinese national security laws which require tech companies to release confidential business and customer data. Primavera acquired Tutor.com in January 2022.

""While providing educational services, Tutor.com collects personal data on users, such as location, internet protocol addresses, and contents of the tutoring sessions,"" Cotton wrote. ""As Chinese national security laws require companies to release confidential business and customer data to the Chinese government, we are paying to expose our military and their children’s private information to the Chinese Communist Party.""

Cotton also sought clarification on whether an internal review has been conducted to determine the continuation of the business relationship with Tutor.com, and if such a review has not taken place, an explanation is requested. Additionally, Cotton wants statistics on the annual usage of Tutor.com by military personnel or their dependents, and whether users are informed that their data may be shared with a Chinese company.

Cotton has previously called for a nationwide ban on TikTok, saying last month that the CEO is ""lying"" about the app being safe for users.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seeking to amend the city's sanctuary laws to exclude illegal migrants who have committed violent crimes.

Adams has mentioned his desire to tighten the city's regulations on illegal migrants multiple times this week, with his latest at a Tuesday press conference.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS DOUBLES DOWN ON CALL FOR CHANGES TO CITY'S 'SANCTUARY' STATUS AMID MIGRANTS CRISIS

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

This echoes the New York City mayor's previous remarks made during a Q&A session at an event on Monday.

""The overwhelming amount of migrants that are here, they want to work. I still don’t understand why the federal government’s not allowing them to work,"" Adams said Monday. ""They need to have the right to work like all of us that have come to this country had the ability to do so.""

MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS NEW YORK CITY HAS 'RUN OUT OF ROOM' FOR MIGRANTS: 'IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER'

""But those small numbers that are committing crimes, we need to modify the sanctuary city law that if you commit a felony, a violent act, we should be able to turn you over to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and have you deported.""

He added, ""It is a right to live in this city, and you should not be committing crimes in our city. Right now, we don’t have the authority to do so.""

Adams commended his administration on Monday for doing an excellent job during a challenging time, but he stated his hands are tied by federal and local law.

The mayor spoke about some migrants participating in robberies and using mopeds to commit snatch-and-grab stick-ups.

Adams has said before that migrants committing crimes should be handed over to ICE and deported.

Under the proposal from Republican Sen. John Polk of Hattiesburg, the board that governs the eight schools would choose three to close by June 30, 2028. The bill does not specify which institutions would close but says the board would make the decision based on enrollment, federal aid, tuition rates, degree programs and local economic impact.



MISSISSIPPI MAN GETS OVER 3 YEARS FOR RACIST, HOMICIDAL THREATS MADE ON SNAPCHAT

House Universities and Colleges Committee Chairman Donnie Scoggin, a Republican from Ellisville, said he had not studied Polk's bill, but a study committee to evaluate those metrics would be a necessary prerequisite.

""I am not for closing any of the colleges at this time without having a whole lot more knowledge,"" Scoggin told The Associated Press. ""I would not support that without knowing a whole lot more.""

Citing declining enrollment at several institutions, Polk has said the Legislature is appropriating too much money to keep the universities afloat. He declined to comment further on Wednesday.

Polk's proposal is not the first attempt to reduce the number of universities in Mississippi.

In 2009, then-Gov. Haley Barbour said Mississippi could not afford to keep all eight. Barbour, a Republican, proposed reducing the number to five by merging Mississippi University for Women into Mississippi State University and consolidating the three historically Black universities — Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi Valley State — into one school with Jackson State in charge. His proposal never gained traction because of widespread opposition from legislators and alumni groups.

Democratic Sen. Hillman Frazier of Jackson said Barbour’s failure showed there has never been a strong appetite for closing institutions in Mississippi. He also said the universities could reverse their enrollment declines with more state support.

""If you give the institutions the tools they need to attract students, that will address that,"" Frazier said. ""It sounds good politically, trying to be a fiscal conservative, but we need to give our universities the tools they need to be successful.""

Mississippi University for Women has attempted to recruit more students by switching to a name that doesn’t include the word ""Women."" But the university said last week that it was pausing that rebranding effort.

The eldest son of Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., was arrested Tuesday after several property thefts were reported in Rifle, Colorado, police said.

Tyler Jay Boebert, 18, faces five felony charges and more than a dozen misdemeanor offenses in connection to a recent string of vehicle trespass and property thefts, the Rifle Police Department said.

He is charged with four counts of criminal possession of ID documents belonging to multiple victims, one count of conspiracy to commit a felony and ""over 15 additional misdemeanor and petty offenses,"" the department stated.

""This is an ongoing investigation, no further information will be released at this time,"" Rifle police said, adding that all suspects are considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

REP. LAUREN BOEBERT'S EX-HUSBAND ARRESTED FOLLOWING ALTERCATION WITH CONGRESSWOMAN AT RESTAURANT

Online jail records show the teen is currently in the custody of the Garfield County Sheriff's Office. There is no bond information listed.

Reached for comment, Rep. Boebert said, ""I love my son Tyler, who has been through some very difficult, public challenges for a young man and the subject of attention that he didn't ask for.""

""It breaks my heart to see my child struggling and, in this situation, especially when he has been provided multiple opportunities to get his life on track,"" she said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""I will never give up on him and I will continue to be there for him. As an adult and father, Tyler will take responsibility for his actions and should be held accountable for poor decisions just like any other citizen.""

Boebert, 37, announced last year that her son Tyler, then-17, fathered a baby boy with his girlfriend, making her a grandmother.

Police were involved with Boebert's family earlier this year when officers received reports that the congresswoman was fighting with her ex-husband and Tyler's father, Jayson Boebert.

Jayson was arrested on Jan. 9 following the incident on charges of misdemeanor assault and criminal mischief. He was later released on bail from Garfield County Jail, according to the New York Post.

BOEBERT RESPONDS TO REPORTS OF FIGHT WITH EX-HUSBAND AT COLORADO RESTAURANT AFTER POLICE CALLED

A judge granted Boebert a temporary restraining order against her ex-husband earlier this month after she alleged Jayson threatened to harm her and himself.

In court papers, the lawmaker claimed her former spouse ""made multiple suicidal threats and threats to harm me over the past 14 months,"" according to the Denver Post.

Jayson told The Associated Press in an interview that he was the victim at the restaurant. ""I would never harm Lauren. I just want to move on and be in peace,"" he said.

He also accused his ex-wife of using the restraining order to ""justify"" her move to a new congressional district.

In her request, Boebert also cited a physical fight between her ex-husband and their 18-year-old son on Jan. 9. As Tyler called authorities, Jayson allegedly grabbed a rifle and left, according to court documents. Jayson was charged with harassment, prohibited use of a weapon and third-degree assault, court documents show. Boebert was not present during that altercation.

A Republican who has served two terms in the U.S. House representing the western side of the state, Boebert announced on Dec. 27 that she was switching congressional districts this year to run for a seat representing the eastern side of Colorado. The 4th Congressional District seat is open with the retirement of Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.

Six people were arrested Tuesday after police say they disrupted a city council meeting.

Officers were called to Seattle City Council chamber around 2:55 p.m. ""as people filled the room and continued to interfere with the session,"" police said in a news release.

The three men and three women were told to leave the chamber, but police say they refused and were told they would be arrested if they continued to interrupt. All six were charged with criminal trespass, and one of the men was also charged with obstruction.

Video of the meeting was posted on the city's Seattle Channel website, lasting just under two and a half hours. Two recesses were taken during that time, including one taken at the time police were called. It was supposed to last 15 minutes but went on for more than an hour.

Police say the city council meeting was able to resume after the arrests and many others left the chamber without any issues, but chanting and banging on windows could be heard when council members attempted to continue.

""Our physical safety is being threatened by the actions of the demonstrators outside banging on the windows, which could easily get broken, and we will have a mob scene,"" District 5 council member Cathy Moore said while asking for police assistance. ""I physically feel threatened.""

The protesters were referred to as ""progressive activists"" by local radio reporter Jason Rantz on the social media platform X. He said they were demanding that the city fund housing for refugees, even though ""they are not even being housed in Seattle currently.""

Many of them used the public comment portion of the meeting to talk about the issue.

""The issues of refugee housing and police surveillance are related,"" a woman named Lauren said. ""More money for police surveillance and ineffective and racist technologies like [‘Spothotter’] means less money for asylum seekers and other low-income people who desperately need housing.""

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday downplayed the notion that President Biden’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday was political and blamed Republicans for making the crisis worse.

President Biden and his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, are both scheduled to make dueling trips to the border on Thursday. Biden will visit Brownsville, while Trump will visit Eagle Pass, an area that has seen high levels of illegal crossings and has become a flashpoint in an ongoing battle between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the Biden administration.

Responding to a reporter’s question that Biden’s visit was merely in reaction to Trump’s visit – during an election year, no less – Jean-Pierre said the president’s schedule couldn’t just be upended on such short notice.

""[The president] has said that when Republicans rejected that Senate bipartisan bill on border security, on the immigration policy to fix a broken system that has been broken for decades, he said he was going to take it directly to the American people and also at the same time, hear from law enforcement and frontline personnel who deal with this issue every day,"" Jean-Pierre said.

President Biden, despite reversing many Trump-era border policies upon taking office, has repeatedly said his hands are tied on the border issue, saying the matter must be solved via legislation.

A bipartisan Biden-backed border security deal crafted by Senate negotiators amid an unprecedented surge in immigration collapsed in early February after Trump signaled his disapproval. That, in turn, has given the White House fodder to accuse Republicans of not taking the border issue seriously.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE, AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Jean-Pierre said Republicans, having rejected the deal, are ""getting in the way"" when it comes to fixing the border.

""This is not about politics for this president. This is about how we're going to fix an issue that the majority of Americans care about, a broken immigration system, the challenges at the border. That's why the president thought it was important to go at this time,"" Jean-Pierre said.

Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich noted that the administration has often criticized Republicans who go to the border to hold similar press conferences, writing them off as ""publicity stunts"" and ""photo ops.""

Jean-Pierre said Biden’s visit was ""very different,"" and repeated her assertion that Republicans ""constantly get in the way.""

""They consistently get in the way of what the president is trying to do to get more resources,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""They are turning this into a political stunt by listening to Donald Trump and saying that they need to kill it.""

On the suggestion that Biden just happened to be going to the border during an election year, despite it being a problem for the past three years, Jean-Pierre pointed to Biden’s ""comprehensive immigration policy"" implemented on day one of his presidency.

""He did that on the first day. That was his first piece of legislation. I would hope the American people would see how serious this president was or is about fixing this issue,"" she said.

MARYLAND COUNTY TO OPEN ICE COOPERATION AFTER PAST STONEWALLING, RELEASE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

After taking office, Biden signed two executive orders on immigration and pledged to roll back many of the policies put in place by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Within a few months, Biden took more than 90 actions related to the border.

Under the president’s stewardship, illegal immigration has skyrocketed to historic levels. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report for fiscal 2023 showed that the number of illegal immigrants on the non-detained docket soared from 3.7 million in FY 2021 to nearly 4.8 million in FY 2022 to nearly 6.2 million in FY 2023.

Thursday will mark Biden’s second visit to the border since taking office. The area he is visiting, the Rio Grande Valley, which includes Brownsville, gives Biden a platform where illegal crossings have dropped sharply.

The area is also a friendly congressional district that – as noted by Border Patrol Union President Brandon Judd – historically hasn’t seen much illegal traffic, in large part due to the infrastructure Trump provided while in office, and more recently due to the actions of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott since Biden took office.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

End of an Era

Longtime Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in an emotional speech in the Senate shortly after noon.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said. McConnell's first Senate term started in 1985, under the late President Reagan, and McConnell remained a huge fan (despite Reagan at first calling him ""Mitch O'Donnell -- Close enough""). But McConnell didn't reminisce much.

""There'll be plenty of time to express my gratitude and greater detail as I sprint towards the finish line, which is now in sight,"" he said.

McConnell's dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference after the November election, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, who said at a Fox News town hall recently: ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Yet after McConnell's announcement, gratitude poured in from both McConnell's allies and his critics. ""I’m grateful for his service.... I think Mitch's tenure has had many legacies. But no legacy is more consequential than the nomination and confirmation of hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary. And that is a lasting benefit to the American people for which I'm deeply grateful,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters.

McConnell said he intends to finish his current Senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

Oklahoma authorities are investigating a local high school after footage from a fundraiser event appeared to show students sucking and licking one another's toes last week.

The footage from Deer Creek High School in Edmond, Oklahoma, shocked and disgusted social media users across the country this weekend. Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters soon announced an investigation into the incident, calling it ""disgusting.""

The footage, originally obtained by Fox 25, was taken during a week-long fundraiser for a local coffee shop that employs people with special needs. Students from 9th through 12th grade volunteered to take part in various class competitions that students paid to attend, according to the outlet.

The video shows student volunteers who were paired up, one set sitting on chairs while the others laid down below them and licked peanut butter off of their toes.

""This is disgusting,"" Walters said in a statement on Friday. ""We are cleaning up this filth in Oklahoma schools. Our agency is investigating.""

Outrage librarian Libs of TikTok soon shared the footage on social media, demanding to know ""who approved this."" The account mistakenly claimed that the students were paired up with adults in the activity, however.

Reactions to the incident rolled in, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declaring ""this is child abuse.""

Walters then replied to Cruz' statement, saying ""Completely agree. We are stopping this in Oklahoma.""

Parents and students also reacted in statements to Fox 25. One parent who spoke with the outlet anonymously said

""It was surprising,"" one student told the outlet. ""I didn't think they were going to do all that. I was just shocked. I didn't really have like a feeling. I was kind of disgusted, and then kind of glad I wasn't over there.""

""Whenever she told me yesterday that was happening, I had to ask her, 'Wait, what? They're licking peanut butter off of toes? What?"" one parent said of a conversation with their student.

Meanwhile, the school celebrated the ""success"" of the fundraiser in a public statement.

""This afternoon, Deer Creek High School announced a grand total of $152,830.38 raised for Not Your Average Joe Coffee, an organization created to 'inspire our community by including students and adults with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities,"" school staff wrote.

""On Thursday, February 29, 2024, Deer Creek High School hosted an assembly called the Clash of Classes for students who paid to attend. During this assembly, ninth through twelfth grade students volunteered to participate in various student-organized class competitions, in the spirit of raising money for NYAJ. All participants in the assembly were students who signed up for the game(s) they played ahead of time. No Deer Creek faculty or staff participated in any of the games during this Clash of Classes assembly. Many dedicated students gave generously of their personal time to achieve this momentous accomplishment, which will serve communities beyond the boundaries of Deer Creek. We would like to thank all of the patrons, businesses and sponsors who contributed to the success of this year’s Wonderful Week of Fundraising,"" the statement continued.

The tax credit bill received bipartisan support, passing the chamber by a vote of 162-3. It provides a state income tax credit of up to $300 that could be used to pay for training and gun storage devices.

But Democrats decried the second bill banning the merchant code as a giveaway to the gun lobby that would make the state less safe.

STATE DEMS ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘BACKDOOR GUN TAX’ ON LAWFUL FIREARM OWNERS

Both bills now go to the state Senate for consideration.

Merchant category codes exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers. In 2022, Visa and other credit card companies said they would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, though they later put that decision on hold in the face of opposition from the gun lobby and conservative politicians.

There had been hope that categorizing credit and debit card purchases would allow authorities to potentially see red flags — like significant ammunition purchases — before a mass shooting could happen.

Republican state Rep. Jason Ridley, noting the ISO is based in Switzerland, said the code could be used to create a registry of gun sales.

""I don’t care which side of firearms you stand on,"" he said. ""Nobody should know what you’re buying and keeping a registry, especially a foreign country.""

Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state.

""She probably should drop out,"" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. ""I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.""

But Jodi said ""she should still stay in the race.""

""She's a better candidate than Trump,"" she added.

Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday.

""I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,"" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. ""I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.""

""I really don't know what she's doing,"" he continued. ""She's out of control.""

Similarly, Scott said, ""she needs to get out"" of the race. ""It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,"" he added.

KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT

Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman.

""She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do."" George said. ""If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.""

But Dan said he had ""no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.""

""She’s got no path to victory,"" he continued.

Theresa said: ""She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.""

Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination.

""I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.""

Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because ""we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.""

""I like Trump,"" he said. ""Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.""

But Josh said Haley's effort ""seems pointless.""

""It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,"" he told Fox News, ""which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden's predictions of a cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel are looking too sweet to be true, with multiple Hamas officials rejecting the current deal.

Biden predicted between licks of an ice cream cone on Monday that Hamas would accept a deal with Israel in the coming days, but statements from Hamas officials show little hope of progress.

""I hope by… the end of the weekend,"" Biden said Monday with cone in hand. ""My national security advisor tells me we’re close. We’re close. It’s not one yet. My hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a cease-fire.""

Meanwhile, multiple Hamas officials indicated on Tuesday and Wednesday that no breakthrough in negotiations had been made, according to The New York Times.

ISRAELI SECURITY EXPERTS SAY BIDEN’S PALESTINIAN STATE PUSH IS AN ’EXISTENTIAL THREAT’

""We are not interested in engaging with what’s been floated, because it does not fulfill our demands,"" Hamas official Ahmad Abdelhadi said in an interview with a Lebanese broadcaster.

BIDEN TO GO TO UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO FORCE TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE ON ISRAEL, HALT RAFAH OFFENSIVE

More concerning, Hamas spokesman Basem Naim said the terrorist organization had not even received ""any new proposals"" since the parties met last week.

Hamas is not the only party warning Biden to pump the brakes. Qatar, which has played a major role throughout the negotiations, indicated on Tuesday that there is no deadline for an agreement.

""The efforts are ongoing; all the parties are conducting regular meetings,"" Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters, according to NYT. ""But for now, while we certainly hope it will be achieved as soon as possible, we don’t have anything in our hands so as to comment on that deadline.""

Meanwhile, Israel is deep in the planning process for an expected invasion of Rafah, the Gaza town on the border with Egypt that plays host to both the final remnants of Hamas and key routes for aid.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an invasion would proceed at some point regardless of whether a cease-fire agreement is reached.

President Biden visited the southern border in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday, and was joined by a number of top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but Vice President Kamala Harris was not among them.

Biden spoke in Brownsville after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He urged Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that he believes will help solve the raging crisis at the southern border.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

BIDEN, DURING VISIT TO OVERWHELMED BORDER, URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK SENATE BILL: ‘TIME TO ACT’

But the vice president, who was tasked in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration, was not there.

The administration had initially leaned firmly into the root-causes narrative in early 2021, claiming that those causes – which include climate change, violence, poverty and economic insecurity – were driving migration to the U.S. border. Its answer, therefore, was to engage with governments and to invest in targeting those causes, eventually bringing migration down.

The assignment quickly led to Harris being dubbed the ""border czar"" – a title the White House rejected, stressing instead that it was more to do with international engagement. She would go on to visit the border in El Paso in June 2021 after facing pressure.

As part of that effort, Harris has been attempting to rally private-sector investment to the region via a Call to Action – particularly into the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

""First, I do believe most people don't want to leave home. They don't want to leave their grandmother. They don't want to leave the place where they worship and the community that they've always known,"" Harris said in 2022. ""And so, when they do, it is usually for one of two reasons: They are fleeing harm, or to stay means they simply cannot satisfy their basic needs or the needs of their family.""

A year ago, Harris announced an additional $950 million in response to the Call to Action, bringing in a total of more than $4.2 billion since May 2021.

But since then, her public role only appears to have continually shrunk, even amid a historic year for illegal immigration, with more than 2.4 million migrant encounters in FY 23. FY 24 has been similarly overwhelming, with over 300,000 encounters in December.

Harris was not part of the border tour on Thursday, nor was she part of a delegation to Mexico City in December with Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

In that meeting, the two countries, according to a White House readout, ""reaffirmed their existing commitments on fostering an orderly, humane, and regular migration.""

""This includes reinforcing our partnership to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, inequality, and violence, and for the two countries’ initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans,"" it said.

Yet, despite the discussions on root causes, Harris was not in attendance. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.

The L.A. Times recently reported that Harris will meet with new Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo in Washington to announce more private-sector investment.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

But root causes, while still on the agenda, have appeared to be less of a focus for the administration in its border strategy — in part because the migration surge has increasingly been coming from countries coming outside of the Northern Triangle, including from Venezuela, Nicaragua and China.

The administration is now focused on passing the Senate border bill, which has bipartisan support but has struggled to gain enough support to pass due to conservative opposition. The bill includes additional funding for staffing at the border, funding for cities and NGOs, as well as rules tightening asylum and a mechanism to shut down entries when they reach a certain level. Conservatives say it would codify an unnecessarily high level of illegal entries.

Harris has put out a statement calling for Congress to pass the bill earlier this month.

""Let us remember: we are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants have always helped strengthen our country, grow our economy, and drive innovation. We know that in America, diversity is our strength,"" she said. ""So rather than politicize this issue, let us all address it with the urgency and seriousness it requires.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Washington state Republican Chair Jim Walsh has called having voters write their party affiliation on the outside of their mail-in ballot a ""questionable design decision"" as some Washingtonians have raised concerns.

Walsh told Fox News Digital on Friday the requirement to declare one’s party is ""codified in law"" and is only for the primary, not the general election.

""The design where the attestation, the declaration is on the outer part of the envelope, that is not state law, that is a guideline, an administrative decision made by the Washington Secretary of State in conjunction with local county level election officials,"" he said.

Walsh added, ""That is not statutory, that’s just a questionable design decision by the Secretary of State working in conjunction with the local county elections people.""

Walsh said state Republicans have been trying since 2016 to change the law requiring voters to declare their party ""so that people can choose to be unaffiliated,"" but have been blocked by the Democrat-led legislature.

One X user snapped a photo of their ballot envelope, showing where voters must declare themselves as Democrats or Republicans, writing on Thursday, ""New Washington State envelopes for mail-in ballots. NEVER had to disclose my party declaration on the OUTSIDE of my ballot before. Don't feel really good about this.""

Cartoonist Scott Adams reposted it, writing, ""How can this be real?"" and X owner Elon Musk responded, ""What!?""

Another voter wrote, ""QUESTION- Why am I REQUIRED to list party affiliation on the outside of the envelope to VOTE?""

A third X user posted a picture of their envelope, writing, ""Washington State Presidential Primary Ballot … you have to declare on the outside of the envelope?!? Also no option for independents! This is how ballots get tossed before they can even be counted!""

""We’re not keen on the law, but we understand it is the law and that we do need to comply both with state law and with some national and with some national party rules,"" Walsh told Fox News Digital of the requirement to declare a party.

He said the ""spirit of the law"" is to keep voters from people from ""gaming the system, being part of one party and trying to vote in the other party’s primary"" but he felt there could be genuine security concerns with the declaration being on the outside of the ballot.

He told Seattle-area radio host Jason Rantz this week that he suggests voters take their ballot to a ballot box rather than mailing it in.

""Deliver it to a ballot box. Or give it to a trusted person to deliver,"" he said.

But Rantz noted in an opinion piece, that ""Fraud at the primary stage doesn’t make a whole lot of sense this election cycle. Donald Trump will be the nominee and it’s unlikely any other candidate would come close enough for stealth fraud to take place. And while fraud (and mistakes) obviously occur, there’s been no recent evidence of widespread fraud that would be enough to change national elections. But voters rightly remember the scandal around the recount between then-gubernatorial candidates Dino Rossi (R) and Christine Gregoire (D).""

The Washington Secretary of State’s Office has included examples of protests voters wrote on their ballots in 2016 — in showing voters the correct way to mark their ballot — that included statements such as, ""Actually I’m an Independent but if it makes you happy,"" ""Don’t tell me what I need to be … the voters are furious"" and ""I feel like I am being forced to choose a party and that’s not fair.""

The voter's party declaration choice is removed after 60 days, according to the secretary of state's office, noting on its website, for the ""Presidential Primary only, the major political parties require voters to mark and sign the party declaration. If you choose to participate, your choice of party will not affect how you may vote in future elections. You must mark and sign the political party declaration (box) on your envelope for your vote to count.""

The office has not clarified why the declaration is on the outside of the ballot. Fox News Digital has reached out to the secretary of state's office.

A New York state appeals court has denied an attempt by New York City leaders to implement a law that would let non-citizens vote in local elections.

In a 3-1 ruling issued Wednesday by the Appellate Division for the Second Judicial Department, the body said the law violated the New York Constitution and Municipal Home Rule Law.

It ""must be declared null and void,"" the court said in a 43-page ruling.

The law was passed in December 2021 by the City Council and created a class of ""municipal voters,"" comprising non-citizens who reside in the city for at least 30 days before an election and register or pre-register to vote. Municipal voters would be granted the right to participate in elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president and council member.

WISCONSIN'S GOP-LED LEGISLATURE MAKES SECOND ATTEMPT TO DRAW MAPS BEFORE SUPREME COURT DOES

The law faced legal challenges almost immediately.

It would have applied to some 800,000 new eligible voters in a city of 8.5 million. However, the appellate court said that the clause in the state constitution that says ""every citizen shall be entitled to vote…"" applies exclusively to U.S. citizens.

""As there is no reference to non-citizens, and thus, an irrefutable inference applies that non-citizens were intended to be excluded from those individuals entitled to vote in elections,"" the court said.

New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022. It was ruled illegal several months later. The mayor defended the law and appealed a lower ruling against it.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Adams' office and it was not clear if he would appeal Wednesday's ruling.

REPUBLICAN PARTY INFIGHTING ESCALATES IN OHIO AS MARCH PRIMARY NEARS

Many Democrats championed the law, saying it would make the city's politics more inclusive, while Republicans contended it could lead to voter fraud and that Democrats were only looking to pad their numbers.

""Great news! We won in the appellate court and @NYCMayor’s attempt to implement the law to register non-citizens to vote in #NYC elections has been struck down,"" U.S. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-New York, posted on X. ""This is a big victory in preserving both the integrity of our elections & the voice of American citizens!

Malliotakis, who represents New York's borough of Staten Island, was one of several plaintiffs to sue over the law, along with Borough President Vito Fossella.

""Fortunately, common sense prevails in New York, thanks to the decision reached by the Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department. The New York State Constitution is clear in that only citizens can vote in our local elections. It is simply irresponsible and nonsensical to extend this right to non-citizens. We are pleased that the Appellate court shared this understanding. This is a win for New York citizens and upholds the integrity of our elections,"" Fossella said.

The New York Immigration Coalition said it was disappointed in the ruling.

""For generations, New York City’s culture and economy have benefited from the immigrants who have come here to work, raise their families, uplift their communities and pay taxes in New York,"" NYIC Executive Director Murad Awawdeh said in a statement. ""While we are still reviewing the decision and its impact on immigrant New Yorkers, the lawsuit remains another shameful attempt by xenophobic Republicans who would disenfranchise residents rather than promote a more inclusive and participatory democracy. Immigrant New Yorkers deserve a say in how their local government functions and spends their tax money, and we remain committed to ensuring the expansion of voting rights.""

The ruling comes as New York City is grappling with a surge in migrants that has resulted in an uptick in crime and anger from residents. In December, Adams warned that the city was at its ""breaking point"" as city resources and shelter services had become strained.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

After coming into office in 2021, Biden regularly launched rhetorical bombs at Georgia and other states as being ""Jim Crow 2.0"" or ""Jim Eagle,"" for requiring voter ID for mail-in voting. However, Georgia allows three weeks of early voting.

Delaware Superior Court Judge Mark H. Conner ruled in a 25-page opinion, ""The enactments of the General Assembly challenged today are inconsistent with our Constitution and therefore cannot stand.""

Delaware’s constitution in Article 5 Section 1 states that a ""general election shall be held biennially on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November."" The Delaware early voting law, enacted in 2019, allows in-person voting up to 10 days before an election.

FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS DOJ PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE BLACK GEORGIA VOTERS WOULD BE HURT BY SHORTER EARLY VOTING

""The conflict between these two passages is obvious,"" the judge wrote. ""Our Constitution enumerates the one day an election shall be held biennially, and the Early Voting Statute allows for voting at least 10 days before that date.""

The Delaware Board of Elections argued that the words, ""election shall be held"" refers to the last day votes can be cast.

MICHIGAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION GIVES COMMUNITIES MORE TIME TO HANDLE ABSENTEE BALLOTS

The plaintiffs in the case were Delaware state Sen. Gerald Hocker, a Republican, and Delaware resident Michael Mennella, an inspector of elections for the Delaware Department of Elections. Mennella was represented by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a Northern Virginia-based election watchdog group.

""This shows that states have to follow their own constitutions,"" J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Fox News Digital.

He noted this comes days after a New York state appeals court ruled that New York City’s law to allow noncitizens to vote in municipal elections violated the state constitution.

When asked about Biden’s remarks toward other states such as Georgia, Adams said there was some irony.

""There is a little bit of irony, though he never served in the Delaware legislature that passed these laws,"" Adams said. ""But if he wants to talk about state voting, he might want to devote his energy to Delaware.""

Currently 46 states and the District of Columbia allow early in-person voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That tally includes Delaware, which could still appeal the decision.

Neither the Delaware Board of Elections nor the state attorney general’s office responded to inquiries from Fox News Digital for this story about whether there were plans to appeal. Adams said he was not aware of the state’s plans.

This marks Mennella and the legal foundation’s second victory over the state of Delaware in less than two years. In December 2022, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in Mennella’s favor when he challenged the constitutionality of the state’s universal vote-by-mail and same-day voter registration laws.

The lower court judge on Friday also determined a provision of the early voting law that allowed registered voters to get permanent absentee voting status was unconstitutional based on Article 5 Section 4A. This section was added to the state constitution in 1943 and specifies conditions when someone is ""unable to appear"" for in-person voting because a voter is away from home or is sick or disabled. This would also be determined on a per-election basis.

""By granting indefinite absentee voting to those who are unable to vote in a single election extends beyond the limited authority granted to the General Assembly by our Constitution,"" the judge ruled.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Trump and his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were barred earlier this month from operating their business in New York for a range of two to three years. Trump was also found liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

TRUMP BARRED FROM OPERATING BUSINESS, ORDERED TO PAY OVER $350 MILLION IN NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

The former president is appealing the ruling.

On Wednesday, though, a New York Appeals Court judge ruled that the former president must post a bond for the full amount of the judgment and the independent director of compliance will be appointed.

The judge will temporarily allow Trump and his sons to continue running the business as they appeal the decision.

The filing is a temporary order before the motion goes before the full Appeals Court. James’ brief to the panel is due March 11, and Trump's replies are due March 18.

The ruling comes after New York Judge Arthur Engoron handed down his decision earlier in February after a months-long trial beginning in October and stemming from James' lawsuit alleging the former president inflated his assets and committed fraud.

Engoron ruled that Trump and other defendants were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The judge also barred Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or legal entity in New York for two years.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Engoron also ""permanently"" barred defendants Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and former corporate controller Jeffrey McConney from ""serving in the financial control function of any New York corporation or similar business entity registered and/or licensed in New York State"" and as a director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in New York for three years.

James brought the lawsuit accusing Trump and the Trump Organization of fraudulent business practices. The court proceedings were contentious, with Engoron repeatedly placing Trump under a partial gag order to prevent him from criticizing court staff.

James had sought $370 million, plus 9% interest in penalties from Trump. Any awarded funds would go to the New York State Treasury, unless directed elsewhere by the state comptroller.

Trump dismissed the trial as a ""witch hunt"" throughout the process, accusing both Engoron and James of serving as political operatives for Democrats. Trump's legal team also repeatedly blasted the lack of a jury in the trial.

""There was never an option to choose a jury trial,"" a Trump spokesperson told Fox News Digital last month. ""It is unfortunate that a jury won’t be able to hear how absurd the merits of this case are and conclude no wrongdoing ever happened.""

Trump and his family denied any wrongdoing, with the former president saying his assets had been undervalued. Trump's legal team insisted that his financial statements had disclaimers, and made it clear to banks that they should conduct their own assessments.

JUDGE IMPOSES PARTIAL GAG ORDER IN TRUMP ORG TRIAL, BLOCKING PARTIES FROM VERBAL ATTACKS AGAINST COURT STAFF

Trump has said his financial statements were ""perfect,"" and stressed that the bank loans were repaid and ""as happy as can be.""

Throughout the trial, Trump attorneys brought witnesses, including former Deutsche Bank top executives, who testified the banks sought additional business from Trump, whom they viewed as a ""whale of a client.""

Trump's defense also brought in expert witnesses, including New York University accounting professor Eli Bartov, who reviewed the Trump financial statements at issue in the case and said he found no evidence of accounting fraud.

Bartov testified last month that Trump’s financial statements did not violate accounting principles, and he suggested that anything problematic — like a huge year-to-year leap in the estimated value of his Trump Tower penthouse — was simply an error.

The U.S. delivered its first air drop of aid supplies to Gaza on Saturday, with President Biden's administration saying it would be a ""sustained effort"" to bring more food and other aid.

The first of the airdrops landed in Gaza on Saturday, delivering some 38,000 MREs, or meals ready-to-eat. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says drops will continue throughout the coming weeks in partnership with Jordan and other allies.

""We need to do more and the United States will do more,"" Biden told reporters on Friday. ""Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough.""

The U.S. is also considering the delivery of aid by U.S. navy vessels in the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Gaza.

PALESTINIAN HUNGER CRISIS CONTINUES AS DESTROYED BAKERIES STRUGGLE TO REOPEN

The U.S. delivered the aid in a joint operation with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, according to a statement from CENTCOM.

Saturday's drop comes after more than 100 people were reported dead and hundreds more wounded when Palestinians rushing toward trucks loaded with humanitarian aid encountered fire in Gaza City early Thursday, according to local media reports.

The exact circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear; while several reports suggested Israeli troops fired on the crowd as they descended upon the trucks, the Israeli military suggested that most who died were trampled.

Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, said at least 104 people were killed and around 760 were wounded, describing the incident as a ""massacre.""

Israel has contested that description, however, saying the vast majority of those killed in the incident were trampled in the rush toward aid.

""Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip , Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered,"" Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling. The incident is under review.""

The IDF suggested that fewer than 10 civilians were injured by Israeli forces opening fire during the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Hamas says it holds Israel and Biden's administration ""fully responsible"" for the incident and for the ""ethnic cleansing"" of its people. The group called for worldwide demonstrations against Israel's bombardment of Gaza.

Former President Trump attacked his Republican opponent Nikki Haley on Saturday, claiming that former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is ""a little bit"" smarter than her.

Trump addressed an enthusiastic crowd in Richmond, Virginia on Saturday night, days before the Super Tuesday votes are scheduled to take place.

Earlier on Saturday, Trump won the Idaho, Missouri, and Michigan Republican contests. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in the evening, the former president lamented about media coverage of his statements referring to President Biden as ""President Obama.""

Trump maintained that he refers to Biden as ""Obama"" intentionally. He also acknowledged that he has mixed up Haley, who he calls ""Birdbrain,"" with Pelosi.

""I purposely mix up a name, like Birdbrain… you know who Birdbrain is, right, Nikki, with Nancy Pelosi,"" he began.

""I put them in because they're interchangeable in my mind,"" Trump added. ""Except I have to say, I shouldn't say this about a semi-Republican, but I think Pelosi's probably a little bit smarter, actually.""

In January, Haley said that Trump was not ""mentally fit"" for office after he referred to Pelosi as Haley during a speech.

""Last night Trump is at a rally and he’s going on and on, mentioning me multiple times as to why I didn’t take security during the Capitol riots. Why I didn’t handle Jan. 6 better. I wasn’t even in D.C. on Jan. 6. I wasn’t in office then,"" Haley said during a January rally in Keene, New Hampshire.

""They’re saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he’s talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario.""

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

AIR FORCE VET SEEN IN CAPITOL WITH ZIP TIES INTENDED 'TO TAKE HOSTAGES,' PROSECUTOR SAYS

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

Instances of antisemitism and Islamophobia have both risen in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, when militants entered the southern part of the country and slaughtered more than 1,200 people during a music festival.

Israel has responded with heavy shelling and a ground invasion of Gaza. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not delineate between fighters and civilians, has said that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed so far.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

HALEY SAYS US WILL HAVE 'FEMALE PRESIDENT' — EITHER HERSELF OR KAMALA HARRIS

""Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,"" the user added. ""If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

One user responded: ""Vasu Abhiraman (left) is quite partisan, actually.""

""I really appreciate community notes!"" added another.

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

The former president began his remarks from the border Thursday afternoon by saying he spoke to the parents of Riley, who he described as ""an incredible young lady.""

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" he said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Trump's visit to the border coincided with President Biden's own trip to a different section of the border between Texas and Mexico. Biden did not mention Riley in his public remarks.

Trump detailed the brutal murder of 22-year-old nursing student Riley last week.

""A beautiful 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia was barbarically attacked. She was on a morning run… she was a beautiful young woman,"" he said. ""I spoke to her parents yesterday, they are incredible people. They are devastated beyond belief. She was so beautiful in so many ways.""

Trump said she was ""brutally assaulted, horrifically beaten, kidnaped, and savagely murdered.""

""The monster, the charge, charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump said, adding that he ""took the name from Hillary because she’s no longer relevant I guess.""

Trump, the 2024 GOP frontrunner, visited Eagle Pass, Texas, Thursday and toured Shelby Park with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and state officials. He also received a briefing and met with Texas officials, as well as Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council.

The former president and 2024 GOP frontrunner also met with Texas National Guard leadership.

Trump made remarks Thursday following the briefing and tour, slamming Biden for being ""incompetent,"" and for destroying the ""most secure border in history"" under his administration.

""I call him Crooked Joe because he's crooked and he's a terrible president, the worst president our country has ever had, probably the most incompetent president we've ever had,"" he continued. ""But it's allowing thousands and thousands of people to come in from China, Iran, Yemen, the Congo, Syria and a lot of other nations.""

Trump said many of those crossing are ""entire columns of fighting-aged men.""

Trump added that the border crisis ""is like a war… it’s a military operation.""

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

ICE CONFIRMS GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT ENTERED US ILLEGALLY, WAS PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED IN NYC

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, ICE confirmed he had been encountered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in August 2022, after entering near El Paso and was ""paroled and released for further processing.""

ICE also confirmed that Ibarra had been arrested by the New York Police Department a year later, on Sept. 14, 2023, and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation.""

When ICE learns that what it believes to be a removable illegal immigrant has been arrested on criminal charges, the agency will normally lodge a detainer — a request asking local law enforcement to keep the suspect in custody until they can be transferred to ICE and put into deportation proceedings.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER SUSPECT JOSE IBARRA LIVED WITHIN 5-MINUTE WALK OF UGA CRIME SCENE

In this case, however, ICE's statement says Ibarra was released before a detainer could be issued. NYC is also a ""sanctuary city,"" which generally restricts law enforcement from complying with ICE detainers.

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.

Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was ""election interference"" and ""weaponization against a political opponent."" Trump said he was being punished for ""having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.""

Former President Trump's campaign appealed a ruling from an Illinois judge that removed the 2024 presidential candidate from state ballots on Thursday.

The Trump campaign appeal contests Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter's ruling that Trump is disqualified from candidacy under the Constitutional ban on ""insurrectionists.""

Porter's ruling reversed last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter urged the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

The Trump campaign promised an appeal within hours of the ruling, and the order is currently on hold until litigation can be completed.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court battle will likely be rendered moot thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court taking up the same question in an upcoming case. In the case, the court will consider for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

The relevant section states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

Trump has not been charged with inciting an insurrection, but he does face allegations of election interference in Washington, D.C. and Georgia.

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

Former President Trump is leading President Biden in a new poll from the New York Times/Sienna College released Saturday, with voters saying they have little confidence in Biden's leadership.

The survey found that 43% of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 48% said they would vote for Trump. The poll further found that 47% of respondents ""strongly disapprove"" of Biden's handling of the presidency, in addition to 14% who said they ""somewhat disapprove.""

Just 17% stated that they ""strongly approve"" of Biden's handling of the job.

NYT and Sienna conducted the poll from Feb. 25-28, surveying 980 registered voters across the country. The poll was conducted in both English and Spanish using cellphones and landline telephones. It advertised a margin of error of 4%.

The poll further found that just one in four voters believe the country is headed in the right direction. And the number of Americans who believe Biden's policies have hurt them is double the number who believe they have helped, according to the Times.

With regard to the border, 50% of respondents said they would support restricting migrants' ability to apply for asylum, while just 43% said they would oppose the move.

The numbers were even worse for Biden when it comes to the economy, with 74% of Americans saying it is ""poor"" or ""only fair,"" compared to 26% who said the economy is doing ""good"" or ""excellent.""

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had ""devastating consequences,"" and demands immediate action.

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

""Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,"" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. ""Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.""

TRUMP BLAMES 'BIDEN'S BORDER INVASION' FOR LAKEN RILEY MURDER, VOWS 'LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION' IF ELECTED

They added, ""Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.""

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the ""invasion"" that led to Riley’s death.

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

RAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as ""belligerent.""

She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.

McAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it’s ""clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.""

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: 'LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

""We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election.

""If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,"" Haley said in the interview.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House.

""We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,"" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley blamed former President Trump Friday for recent Republican losses in critical electoral races, including those for seats in the Senate, while expressing hope the GOP's new leader in the upper chamber is focused on setting a tone rather than courting Trump.

""You're seeing the wave of what Congress thinks they need to do to win,"" Haley told reporters during a briefing at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood.

Haley was likely referencing Trump's dominance over the House and Senate relative to endorsements and influence.

But Haley suggested lawmakers who cater to the former president are misguided because Republicans have lost pivotal matchups since his presidency.

SENATE REPUBLICANS KEEP HOPE FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT ALIVE

""All of these losses happened after Donald Trump became president in 2016,"" she said, noting gubernatorial, federal and statewide losses in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia.

Haley claimed the only reason Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., was elected in 2021 was because ""he distanced himself"" from Trump.

Youngkin's political team declined to comment to Fox News Digital.

""It’s not an accurate statement,"" according to Zack Roday, a former Youngkin adviser and partner at Ascent Media.

DC PRIMARY REPRESENTS HALEY'S BEST CHANCE YET TO BEAT TRUMP

""Glenn Youngkin won because he built a movement and coalition of Republicans, independents and even Democrats who wanted a new direction for Virginia.""

Despite the losses, Haley claimed members of the House and Senate are now ""falling all over themselves to show that they're more Trump than everybody else.""

Haley weighed in on what the next Senate Republican leader should bring to the table after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's surprise announcement Wednesday that he's stepping down. She didn't suggest any specific senators for the role but explained she wants a leader focused on the people and ""not rewarding people for peacocking on TV.""

""I want to see somebody inspirational. I want to see somebody that says, ‘You know what, we can do things differently,'"" Haley said. ""My hope is that we will. But we'll have to see.""

Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital the campaign's focus is now on Biden and the general election.

""Republican voters have delivered resounding wins for President Trump in every single primary contest, and this race is over,"" she said.

Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father ""because there isn't any,"" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

""Do you think it started before she hired him?"" Merchant asked via text on Jan. 5, three days prior to filing the motion.

""Absolutely,"" Bradley replied.

But in court Tuesday, Bradley claimed he was ""speculating"" in those text message exchanges.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

Mike Dunleavy has threatened to veto an education package overwhelmingly passed by lawmakers after a bruising debate, saying it lacks provisions he favors, including a pilot program offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers.

Dunleavy, a former educator, said this week that there is still time for lawmakers to address issues like the proposed bonuses and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting such schools. The governor has 15 days, excluding Sundays, to act on a bill sent to him if the Legislature is in session.

He can sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. A decision is expected by March 14.

ALASKA FACES TEACHER SHORTAGE AS EDUCATION FUNDING DEBATE DOMINATES LEGISLATURE

Some key lawmakers say the package was a compromise and question whether the state can afford the bonuses — or even if they would work.

Debate over education funding has dominated this legislative session. The House last week voted 38-2 to support a compromise package that included a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula; language encouraging districts to use some of the extra funding for teacher salary and retention bonuses; a state education department position dedicated to supporting charter schools and additional funding for K-3 students who need reading help. The vote followed a period of intense debate that also showed divisions within the Republican-led majority.

The Senate, led by a bipartisan coalition, agreed 18-1 on Monday to support the package, sending it to Dunleavy.

The compromise stemmed from negotiations after the House failed to support bringing up for debate a version of the bill that advanced from the House Rules Committee. That version included Dunleavy’s bonus plan, charter provisions and a roughly $80 million increase in state aid through the formula.

After the bill passed the House, Republican Speaker Cathy Tilton said that while the compromise ""fell short"" of the earlier proposal, ""I’d still call it a ‘qualified’ success.""

School officials had sought a roughly $360 million increase in funding, citing the impact of inflation and high energy and insurance costs. But the state, which relies heavily on oil and earnings from Alaska's nest-egg oil-wealth fund, has struggled with deficits over the last decade, and some lawmakers questioned whether that amount was realistic.

The Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million boost last year, but Dunleavy vetoed half that. Lawmakers did not have enough votes for an override.

Dunleavy has cast the bonuses and support of charter schools as a way of doing things differently. He has questioned whether simply increasing funding to districts will improve student performance.

He has proposed paying teachers bonuses of $5,000 to $15,000 a year over three years, with the highest amount for those in the most remote areas. Estimates suggest the program could cost about $55 million a year.

The language in the education package encouraging districts to use some of the funds for bonuses ""does not ensure the desired ends are realized,"" Dunleavy spokesperson Grant Robinson said by email Thursday.

Republican Senate President Gary Stevens told reporters this week that there is a limit to what the state can afford. A revised revenue forecast is expected by mid-March, and lawmakers haven't even begun publicly debating how big this year's dividend payout to residents from oil-wealth fund earnings should be — typically one of the most contentious debates of the session.

Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, raised questions about how well bonuses might work. He said he thinks there's a ""fair expectation"" that teachers from overseas or the Lower 48 would leave after the three years is up.

He said the level of support for the compromise bill was ""pretty unheard of these days"" for a controversial measure.

Tom Klaameyer, president of NEA-Alaska, a teachers' union, said if Dunleavy vetoes the education package, ""then our schools remain in crisis.""

The measure ""was simply a life preserver that was being thrown or could have been thrown to schools to stem the crisis,"" he said.

He added: ""We’re saying, throw the life preserver.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Speaker Mike Johnson bucked the House GOP’s right flank to pass a short-term federal funding bill on Thursday, setting up Congress to avoid a partial government shutdown.

The bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), extends fiscal 2023’s government funding levels to two deadlines: March 8 and March 22. It passed the House, 320-99.

Majorities in both parties voted for the bill, although more Democrats than Republicans supported it – 113 GOP lawmakers voted for the CR while 97 voted against, and 207 Democrats voted for it versus just two who were opposed. In a modest win for Johnson, however, this CR got more GOP votes than the extension he put on the House floor in January, which got 107 Republicans' support.

Congress is currently operating under a CR passed in January that extended funding for some of its 12 appropriations bills to March 1 and others to March 8.

TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS FLEE CAPITOL HILL AMID RISING CHAOS, DIVISION: 'A BAD WORKPLACE'

House GOP leaders were forced to seek Democrat votes, which were likely anyway, to pass the bill. They fast-tracked it under suspension of the rules, meaning it forgoes the normal process of going through the House Rules Committee and a House-wide procedural vote in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.

It comes after GOP rebels weaponized procedural House votes several times to deliberately sink their own party’s legislation as a protest against leadership.

Many of those same rebels have pushed Johnson to allow for the government to shut down instead of extending the previous Democrat-controlled Congress’ funding levels. They argued that a shutdown, even a partial one, would give House Republicans leverage to push for conservative policies.

HOUSE GOP LEADERS JETTISON PROMISE TO VOTE ON 12 INDIVIDUAL SPENDING BILLS

With expected furloughs of federal employees and suspension of government programs, however, a government shutdown is a politically perilous outcome for both Republicans and Democrats.

This is the fourth CR the House has passed since fiscal 2023 ended on Sept. 30.

""We have to be willing to do what's difficult to save America. I'm not scared of a government shutdown if it's the price we need to pay to secure our border, get our debt under control and stop the government from going after my fellow Americans,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

But Johnson said during his weekly press conference that it would buy negotiators just enough time to release legislative text for their first six spending bills over the weekend while avoiding the negative effects of a partial shutdown.

""All of our members will have 72 hours to review it. That's our commitment. That's our rule. We're respecting it. And that's the only reason we need the process CR, to allow us time to do that,"" Johnson said.

""If I did it the way … [former House] Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi did, we just drop that bill and vote on it within hours. We're not going to do that.""

The CR must now pass the Senate and be signed by President Biden to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

CHINESE HACKERS HAD ACCESS TO US INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 'AT LEAST 5 YEARS' BEFORE DISCOVERY

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

The head of the union that represents Border Patrol agents across the country exploded on President Biden during a Thursday press conference, declaring agents were ""mad as hell,"" and ""p----d"" over his policies that allowed the situation at the border to deteriorate so badly.

National Border Patrol Council (NBCP) President Brandon Judd appeared alongside former President Donald Trump in Eagle Pass, Texas, which he described as the ""epicenter"" of the border crisis, as Biden held a dueling event a few hundred miles away at the less affected Brownsville, Texas.

""Sir, I want you to know your agents, my agents, they're mad as hell — absolutely mad that President Biden went to Brownsville, Texas, rather than going to Arizona, rather than going to San Diego, California, rather than coming to Eagle Pass, Texas, which has been the epicenter,"" Judd said after Trump invited him to the microphone to speak.

Judd said the trip allowed Trump to see how his policies worked compared to those implemented by the Biden administration, and that he had the clarity on how to expand them should he be elected president in November.

""Your agents … they are pissed. Border patrol agents are upset that we cannot get the proper policy that is necessary to protect human life, to protect American citizens, to protect the people that are crossing the border illegally,"" Judd said. ""We can't do that because President Biden's policies continue to invite people to cross here.""

""Thank goodness we have a governor like Governor Abbott. Thank goodness we have somebody that's willing to run for President of the United States, forego everything else he's been doing to serve the American people. Mr. President, thank you,"" he added.

President Biden signed a funding measure on Friday that was agreed upon by congressional leaders and passed in both the House and Senate, once again averting a government shutdown.

Biden signed H.R. 7463, a funding bill titled ""Extension of Continuing Appropriations and Other Matters Act, 2024,"" which extends the March 1 funding deadline for the first slate of appropriations bills by one week, pushing it to March 8.

Those bills will head to the House and Senate for votes in the next week.

The funding bill also moves the second deadline for a second slate of bills to March 22.

However, the second group of appropriations measures still need to be finalized and agreed upon before heading to the floor for votes.

""We are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Wednesday, along with House Appropriations Committee Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine.

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A Lubbock, Texas, federal judge ruled Tuesday that lawmakers unconstitutionally passed the $1.7 trillion government funding bill in 2022 when they did so under a pandemic-era rule allowing members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on the matter by proxy instead of in person.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, requested the courts block a provision of the funding bill that gave pregnant workers stronger legal protections.

U.S. District Judge Wesley Hendrix reviewed the request and issued a ""limited"" ruling on one of two provisions Paxton sought to have blocked.

Hendrix, appointed by former President Trump, ruled the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was wrongfully passed, blocking the law from being enforced against the state as an employer.

TEXAS AG KEN PAXTON SAYS STATE WON’T COMPLY WITH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ORDER TO REOPEN PARK TO FEDERAL AGENTS

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, enacted in December 2022, requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers.

In his ruling, Hendrix noted that his injunction is only applicable to state government employees.

Paxton filed a lawsuit last year, arguing the federal spending package was unconstitutionally passed because over half of the House of Representatives were not physically present to provide a quorum, yet they still voted by proxy.

EAGLE PASS MAYOR SAYS SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TEXAS, FEDS OVER BORDER CONTROL IS 'FRUSTRATING,' A 'CONSTANT STRUGGLE'

In May 2020, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, helped get a rule in place allowing lawmakers to vote by proxy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

When Republicans took control of the House in 2022, they ditched the proxy rule after challenging it in court unsuccessfully.

Hendrix said in a 120-page ruling that for over 200 years leading up to the voting proxy rule’s adoption, Congress understood that the majority of members of the House or Senate were required to be physically present to have a quorum to pass legislation, as stipulated under the Constitution’s quorum clause.

TEXAS AG PAXTON SUES NGO AIDING MIGRANTS, ACCUSES IT OF ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

""Supreme Court precedent has long held that the Quorum Clause requires presence, and the Clause’s text distinguishes those absent members from the quorum and provides a mechanism for obtaining a physical quorum by compelling absent members to attend,"" he wrote.

Paxton said Congress acted ""egregiously"" when it passed the $1.7 trillion funding bill.

""Congress acted egregiously by passing the largest spending bill in U.S. history with fewer than half the members of the House bothering to do their jobs, show up and vote in person,"" Paxton said. ""Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi abused proxy voting under the pretext of COVID-19 to pass this law, then Biden signed it, knowing they violated the Constitution. This was a stunning violation of the rule of law. I am relieved the court upheld the Constitution.""

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

Reuters reported that Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer Matthew Miller said the ruling ""correctly"" concluded a physical quorum was required to vote.

Hendrix also found in his ruling that Texas did not have standing to challenge $20 million appropriated in the bill to fund a pilot program providing case management and other services to noncitizens during immigration removal proceedings.

FIRST ON FOX — Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott slammed what he called a ""two-tiered standard"" concerning President Biden mulling executive action to handle the border crisis, and how former President Trump was treated during his presidency when he attempted to do the same thing.

""Well, there's no question that there's a two-tiered standard in our national media. The way they cover President Trump versus the way that they use kid gloves to cover Joe Biden. There's no question about that,"" Scott said during a Thursday interview with Fox News Digital when asked about reports that Biden is weighing executive action to crack down on asylum-seeking.

""More important, however, is that when we had President Trump in office, we actually had a basically sealed southern border. Crossings were around a thousand a day. Under President Biden in December, we had 10,000 crossings on average per day,"" he added. ""That contrast should be what the media is covering.""

TRUMP VP AUDITIONS: SCOTT RAMASWAMY HIT TRAIL IN SOUTH CAROLINA ON BEHALF OF FORMER PRESIDENT

An administration source told Fox earlier this week that Biden is considering executive action to restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum amid historic numbers of border crossings facing the country, but that it’s one of ""several"" plans being looked at.

An administration official also stressed that there have been no final decisions on what actions, if any, could be taken and that exploring policy options does not mean they will come to pass.

One of the options reportedly on the table is use of 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to restrict certain categories of foreigners who are deemed ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Trump attempted to use it but was blocked by a federal court, a ruling later upheld by the Supreme Court.

HISPANIC HOUSE DEMS ACCUSE BIDEN OF LEAVING THEM IN DARK ON POSSIBLE EXECUTIVE ACTION AT BORDER

The former president also faced sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the liberal media for attempting to use executive action on immigration, including being called ""xenophobic"" and ""racist.""

Biden has yet to face the same widespread level of criticism, although some of the more progressive Democrats have lashed out at the idea of Biden reverting to the previous administration's approach.

""Democrats CANNOT solve immigration problems by adopting Trump-like policies,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote in a post on X, while Rep. Jesús García, D-Ill., claimed, ""President Biden would be making a grave mistake if he moves forward with this policy.""

DEMOCRAT IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE UNDER FIRE FOR PAST AMNESTY, SANCTUARY CITY ‘SUPPORT’ AS BORDER CRISIS SPIRALS

The possible executive action by Biden comes just under two weeks after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border crisis.

During a gaggle with reporters after casting his vote in the South Carolina primary earlier in the day, Scott told Fox that he ""certainly"" supported Mayorkas' impeachment, and he praised the House for having the ""courage"" to take such action. However, he admitted the task likely wouldn't go anywhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

""The best way to eliminate Mayorkas being the secretary is to actually fire Joe Biden,"" he said. ""If we really want to change the trajectory of the country as it relates to immigration — illegal immigration — we have to do so by having someone, a commander-in-chief, who respects our borders, who wants to close our borders.""

Wade was hired in 2022 to help prosecute the sweeping case against Trump and 18 other co-defendants on charges related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including racketeering, violating the oath of office, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, forgery and false statements.

Four co-defendants in the case alleged in subsequent court filings that Wade was romantically involved with Willis at the time he was hired and that she financially benefitted from his employment because of their relationship and lavish vacations they took together.

Co-defendants have also alleged that Wade’s ""lack of experience"" prosecuting complex cases makes him ""unqualified"" to work the case and questioned why Willis hired him in the first place.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

A John Marshall Law School graduate, Wade worked in private practice at his firm Wade & Campbell prior to his work with the Fulton County DA’s office.

""Whether you are in need of representation after a major car accident or are going through a change in your personal life that requires representation with a family law issue; whether you have a contract dispute, or whether you are involved in any type of civil litigation, Nathan J. Wade will be a zealous advocate for you,"" his firm’s website reads.

The New York Times reported that public records show ""scant evidence"" that he has prosecuted major criminal cases, with no evidence that he has handled a major political corruption case or one involving the state’s ""complicated racketeering statute"" under which all the defendants in the Trump case have been charged.

FANI WILLIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH WINK ON THE STAND, LABELS FORMER LOVER NATHAN WADE A 'SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN'

In 1999, Wade spent four months as an assistant solicitor in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County. From 2011 to 2021, he was an associate municipal court judge in Marietta, Georgia, handling misdemeanor cases.

Wade ran for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court three times between 2012 and 2016 but lost each time.

5 EXPLOSIVE MOMENTS FROM FANI WILLIS' HEATED TESTIMONY IN TRUMP FULTON COUNTY CASE: 'IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN …'

Wade took the stand on Thursday during a tense court hearing to hash out evidence to allegations that Willis had financially benefitted from Wade’s employment.

Both Willis and Wade testified that Wade had routinely paid for the trips and that Willis would reimburse him with cash. When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep six months of regular expenses on hand in cash.

Wade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that had been made in cash.

Wade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims.

""You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?"" Gillen asked.

""No, sir,"" Wade said.

""Not a single solitary one,"" Gillen pressed.



""Not a one.""

Willis, in her testimony, called Wade a ""southern gentleman."" Willis said her relationship with Wade ended roughly last summer but that the two remain ""very good friends"" and are ""probably closer than ever because of these attacks.""

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradict testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office. Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" the Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

Yeartie testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021, and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, to when she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie's testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie to be a friend.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A transgender lawmaker stormed out of the Virginia Senate chamber in protest after Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears referred to the lawmaker as ""sir"" on Monday.

Sen. Danica Roem, a Democrat and the first transgender person to serve in the Virginia legislature, is biologically male but identifies as a woman. Roem asked a question about a piece of legislation during a general session on Monday afternoon.

""Madam President, how many votes would it take to pass this bill with the emergency clause?"" Roem asked.

""That would be four-fifths, Senator,"" Sears responded.

""And what would be the exact number of that, Madam President?"" Roem asked again.

""Yes, sir, that would be 32,"" Sears said.

Roem could then be heard putting down the microphone and leaving the chamber. The lawmaker did not cast a vote in the roll call vote moments later.

Sears offered an apology for the incident later in the session, though she did not specifically apologize for referring to Roem by the lawmaker's biological gender.

""I upset Sen. Roem,"" Sears said. ""Let it be known I am not here to upset anyone. I am here to do the job the people of Virginia have called me to do, and that is to treat everyone with respect and dignity. I myself have at times not been afforded that same respect and dignity.""

""But in this body, as long as I am president of the Senate and by the grace of God, I will be treated with respect and dignity, and I will treat everyone else with respect and dignity,"" she added. ""It is never my intention to make anyone offended, and I hope that others would consider that they would try not to offend me as well,"" she said. ""We are all equal under the law. And so I apologize, I apologize, I apologize, and I would hope, I would hope, that everyone would understand there is no intent to offend but that we would also give each other the ability to forgive each other.""

Please enter a valid email address.

FIRST ON FOX - Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and her former lover Nathan Wade are facing two ethics complaints from a conservative government watchdog group based on their court testimony on allegations they had an 'improper' affair.

The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) is requesting that the Georgia state bar open disciplinary proceedings against the Fulton County DA and Wade for violations of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct.

AAF is alleging Wade lied under oath about his relationship with Willis, and alleging that Willis admitted to keeping campaign money for personal use on the witness stand.

""To ensure that the citizens of Fulton County and the State of Georgia understand that the Bar will not countenance any violation of its ethics by those charged with upholding it, we urge you to revoke Ms. Willis’ license to practice law and permanently bar her from practicing law,"" adding the same request in a separate complaint against Wade.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

The complaint against Willis notes that on Feb 15. 2024 she testified before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee and was questioned regarding her reimbursement of Wade and her use of cash with no bank or transaction receipts. Willis was asked where the cash originally came from, to which she replied:

""Cash is fungible. I’ve had cash for years in my house. So for me to tell you the source of where it comes from ... when you go to Publix and you buy something and you get fifty dollars and you throw it in there. It’s been my whole life. When I took out a large amount of money during my first campaign, I kept some of the cash of that.""

AAF claims that Willis’ ""admission"" represents ""the admission of a clear violation of Georgia Campaign Finance law."" The portion of that law they say is applicable states that, ""Nothing in this Code section shall permit or authorize a candidate to utilize campaign funds for the purpose of making gifts, loans, or investments directly to: (A) The candidate…""

""The statute is unambiguous – and the facts are not in dispute – as Ms. Willis described in her testimony, she placed the money that was intended for her campaign into a ""fungible"" slush fund with other moneys that she would use for various other purposes, including reimbursing her boyfriend for leisure travel,"" the complaint states.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

The complaint also states that her ""keeping some of the cash"" was a ""willful intentional act and denied the citizens of Georgia the ability to exercise effective oversight over her campaign.""

""It is unreasonable to believe that a barred attorney running for public office would not have been aware that the strict reporting guidelines of Georgia campaign finance law existed to protect the public’s right to oversee elections and that she had an obligation to scrupulously abide by them,"" the complaint states.

The complaint against Wade alleges that he lied under oath on more than one occasion. When asked on an interrogatory to ""describe each instance in which you have had sexual relations with a person other than your spouse during the course of the marriage,"" and he said, ""none.""

Wade testified that his marriage ""was irretrievably broken in 2015"" but that he and his wife agreed to delay a divorce for the sake of their children.

""First it is simply not credible that Mr. Wade did not know that he had sexual relations with Ms. Willis when he replied to the interrogatories above in his divorce case. Put simply, it is clear Mr. Wade knew that he had had sex with Ms. Willis, and he knew that at the time he was still married, and he simply lied in the interrogatories,"" the AAF complaint states.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

""Whether he was married was not a complicated question. In fact, he was the plaintiff in a divorce case, a case that cannot proceed without the parties being married. As an officer of the court, this is simply unacceptable. It is challenging to think of a more clear-cut example of ‘dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,’"" the complaint says.

The complaint goes on to say that Wade’s ""rationale for not answering the interrogatories truthfully under questioning shows a whole lack of understanding of the law that makes him unfit to practice law in the State,"" deeming him a risk to future potential clients.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""The Bar owes the profession and the public a duty to guard the practice from charlatans and incompetents. Any simple reading of Mr. Wade’s testimony quickly reveals that he is so grossly unfamiliar with the simple understanding of a legal concept like marriage that the risk he and his incompetence poses to vulnerable members of the public requires his exclusion from the profession,"" it states.

Willis and Wade did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

House managers serve as ""prosecutors"" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.

One impeachment manager told Fox they had been given ""no clear guidance"" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.

Fox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Fox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.

RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS

Several factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.

That said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.

Some House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.

A senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a ""comprehensive briefing"" last week and ""detailed"" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.

Despite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that ""we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.""

Some House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.

Fox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing ""mock trial"" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.

HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS

""We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,"" said one frustrated manager.

There has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.

Managers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned ""subject lanes"" to argue before the Senate.

One manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.

FIRST ON FOX: A GOP lawmaker accused a nonprofit shelter network of sponsoring a migrant who was recently accused of killing a Georgia nursing student, letting him use its federally funded resources after he entered the U.S. illegally and before he allegedly committed the crime.

Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, sent a letter to Covenant House, a national network of youth homeless shelters, saying that Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) documents indicate that Jose Ibarra, 26, used a New York facility as his sponsor address after he crossed the border in September 2022.

Covenant House denied sponsoring Ibarra.

Gooden questioned whether Covenant House was properly vetting people who came through its doors, whether Ibarra lied about allegedly staying there, and if the organization was encouraging migrants to use its address on federal forms.

Covenant House told Fox News Digital it did not sponsor Ibarra and denied being contacted by federal authorities about him.

""Covenant House does not sponsor the entry of any migrants into the United States. It is neither a policy nor a practice. Covenant House New York did not sponsor Jose Antonio Ibarra’s entry into the country and has not done so for any other person,"" a spokesperson said.

""We do not know how our address came to be on his form, but there have been and continue to be instances when our address is given at the border. We have not been contacted by ICE/DHS regarding this matter, nor have we ever been contacted by them about the use of Covenant House’s name on a form at the border.""

Gooden's letter, sent to Covenant House CEO Bill Bedrossian, stated: ""According to CBP documents, after illegally crossing into El Paso, Jose Antonio Ibarra provided The Covenant House, a federally funded NGO in New York, as his sponsor address. These NGOs receive hundreds of millions in taxpayer funding per year through a left-wing loophole designed to circumvent a federal law that prevents tax dollars from funding illegal immigration.

""I have been fighting to hold NGOs like Covenant House accountable for years. Their usage of federal funds to traffic millions of migrants is unacceptable and has now become deadly.""

GEORGIA NURSING STUDENT FOUND DEAD ON UGA CAMPUS IDENTIFIED AS LAKEN RILEY

Ibarra is charged with murdering 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student Laken Riley, who was killed while jogging at the nearby campus of the University of Georgia.

Her death has sparked renewed scrutiny over how effectively U.S. officials are evaluating migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border before granting entry, primarily to await immigration court proceedings.

In his letter, Gooden asked Covenant House how long Ibarra had stayed at its facility, if he did, and whether Covenant House coordinates with groups in Mexico to share its address with people trying to enter the U.S.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

""Instead of prioritizing the safety and security of American citizens, the Biden administration has chosen to prioritize the interests of illegal immigrants, providing them with sanctuary and support at the expense of taxpayers,"" Gooden wrote.

""Covenant House and other federally funded NGOs must provide accountability and allow oversight from Congress. Failure to do so will result in swift action in the form of subpoenas.""

Gooden's letter does not indicate when Ibarra allegedly used the Covenant House address in New York. It is not uncommon for migrants who first arrive in the U.S. to list a shelter as their place of residence.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

FIRST ON FOX: A bicameral coalition of more than 130 Republican lawmakers penned a letter to the White House on Thursday, urging it to withdraw proposed tailpipe emissions regulations, forcing a transition to electric vehicles (EV).

The Republicans — led by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho — argued that the regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are a ""de facto EV mandate"" phaseout of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. They addressed the letter to President Biden and Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, which is expected to soon finalize the regulations.

""President Biden has made his intentions clear,"" Feenstra said in a statement. ""He would rather force American families — who are already facing financial hardship under the weight of inflation spurred by trillions in wasteful government spending — to buy electric vehicles to advance his Green New Deal agenda than allow folks to choose the best car or truck for their families, businesses, and farms at an affordable price.""

""This misguided decision also strengthens China while weakening our economy because the critical materials needed to manufacture electric vehicles are primarily sourced from China,"" the Iowa lawmaker added. ""Alongside Senator Mike Crapo, I’m proud to lead nearly 140 of my colleagues in urging President Biden to withdraw the proposed rule that would attempt to replace liquid fuels and combustion engines with unreliable and unaffordable electric vehicles.""

BIDEN ADMIN REPORTEDLY DOUBLING DOWN ON GAS CAR CRACKDOWN

Feenstra added that stories of Americans stranded in the cold waiting for their EV to charge during the winter provided further evidence that mandating EVs nationwide is ""ridiculous.""

Overall, under the proposal, which EPA unveiled in April 2023, the White House projected that 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases would be electric by 2032. In addition, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck, 35% of short-haul freight tractor and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could also be electric by then.

The White House said at the time that the tailpipe emissions proposal, which represents the most aggressive proposal of its kind ever proposed, would ""accelerate the clean vehicle transition"" and reduce oil imports by 20 billion barrels.

17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH

However, the proposal has faced widespread opposition from Republicans, as well as some Democrats and energy industry groups who say it will reduce consumer choice, lead to higher prices and benefit China, which dominates the EV battery supply chain. In December, the House voted 221-197, with five Democrats joining 216 Republicans, to pass a resolution nixing the EPA's proposal, but that bill has yet to receive a Senate vote.

""The reality is that most Americans still prefer the internal combustion engine vehicle, and EPA’s proposed rule unnecessarily restricts consumer choice and forces expensive EVs onto Americans at a time when they can least afford it,"" Feenstra, Crapo and the other Republicans wrote in their letter on Thursday.

""Major U.S. automakers have recently lowered their targets and pulled back planned investments in EVs due to low consumer demand and struggling EV units,"" they continued. ""Further, automobile dealers across the country have said EVs continue to sit unpurchased on dealership lots, despite automakers accepting massive losses and unsustainable government incentives.""

Late last year, thousands of auto dealers nationwide, including dealers in all 50 states and who collectively sell every major car brand, called on Biden to rescind the EPA proposal. They warned that, while some consumers are happy with EVs, demand is not keeping pace with supply and their lots are filling up with unwanted EVs.

VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE'

Further, the Republicans argued the Biden administration's proposal would make the U.S. more dependent on foreign supply chains, particularly those established in China. According to the International Energy Agency, China produces about 75% of all lithium-ion batteries and boasts 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% for anodes, two key parts of such batteries.

""Consequences of rules and regulations driven by the Biden Administration’s radical green agenda drastically reduce consumer choice and the affordability of vehicles available to Americans,"" said Crapo. ""Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable vehicles fueled by American-made energy products, not those primarily supplied by China.""

According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents several major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrid, up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.

At the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000.

In addition to Crapo, 23 other members of the Senate signed the letter, including Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Ranking Member John Barrasso, R-Wyo. Additionally, 113 House members signed the letter, including GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing JBS USA, the world's largest producer of beef, over the company's emissions and for ""greenwashing"" by allegedly misleading the public about its environmental impact.

In an announcement, James noted that beef production has the largest greenhouse gas footprint of any major food commodity and that animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. According to James, JBS USA's various net-zero pledges for 2030 and 2040 are therefore misleading and ""not feasible"" given the scope of its worldwide beef production operations.

""As families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis, they are willing to spend more of their hard-earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment,"" James said in a statement. ""When companies falsely advertise their commitment to sustainability, they are misleading consumers and endangering our planet.""

""JBS USA’s greenwashing exploits the pocketbooks of everyday Americans and the promise of a healthy planet for future generations,"" she added. ""My office will always ensure that companies do not abuse the environment and the trust of hardworking consumers for profit.""

GOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING UN FOR CALLING ON AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT

The lawsuit was applauded by state Democrats and national climate advocacy organizations like Earthjustice, Mighty Earth, Friends of the Earth US, Citizens Campaign for the Environment and Stand.earth.

""JBS repeatedly claims that it will reach net zero by 2040. This claim was found to be misleading and yet JBS continues to assert it,"" said Peter Lehner, an attorney at Earthjustice. ""While it is critical for every company to reduce its climate change impact, JBS would need to implement enormous operational changes to achieve this goal. However, JBS is doing very little and is not taking anywhere close to the steps that would be required.""

UN CLIMATE SUMMIT SERVING GOURMET BURGERS, BBQ AS IT CALLS FOR AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT

In her announcement and lawsuit, James pointed to several instances in which JBS USA and its executives made pledges to reduce the company's impact on the environment. She also stated the company — which has a market cap of more than $10 billion and whose North American beef business earns tens of billions of dollars annually — has acknowledged consumers are more interested in sustainable products.

For example, in March 2021, JBS announced a pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 across global operations and including indirect downstream emissions. The company then began a publicity campaign touting the pledge, running a full-page advertisement one month later in The New York Times stating ""it's possible"" for meat production to be ""part of the climate solution.""

Since then, JBS and its subsidiaries have continued to tout the 2040 pledge and other sustainability goals. The company even presented at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai late last year, announcing additional sustainability initiatives and investments.

TWO DOZEN REPUBLICANS CALL ON BIDEN TO DISAVOW JOHN KERRY'S REMARKS TARGETING FOOD PRODUCTION

""JBS takes its commitment to a more sustainable future for agriculture very seriously,"" JBS USA spokesperson Nikki Richardson said in an email to Fox News Digital. ""We disagree with the action taken today by the New York Attorney General’s office.""

""JBS will continue to partner with farmers, ranchers and our food system partners around the world to help feed a growing population while using fewer resources and reducing agriculture’s environmental impact,"" she continued. ""Our belief that American agriculture can help sustainably feed the world is undeterred.""

James' lawsuit comes as environmental groups and lawmakers worldwide increasingly set their sights on the agriculture industry. The global food system — which includes land-use change, actual agricultural production, packaging and waste management — generates about 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of 34% of total worldwide emissions, according to a 2021 study published in the Nature Food journal.

President Biden's international climate envoy John Kerry warned last year that decarbonization would be impossible without a concerted effort from the agriculture industry to achieve green goals.

""We can't get to net-zero, we don't get this job done unless agriculture is front and center as part of the solution. So all of us understand here the depths of this mission,"" Kerry said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Supreme Court expressed strong concerns on Monday about the sweep of state laws restricting how large social media companies moderate user content, a digital free speech case with implications in the political and business arenas.

Separate laws that passed in Florida and Texas and are now challenged in court would require Big Tech companies like X, formerly Twitter, and Facebook to host third-party communications but prevent those businesses from blocking or removing users' posts based on political viewpoints.

The regulations aim to address what some lawmakers call ""censoring"" of conservative messages, and banning politicians, like former President Trump, for violating subjective policies over offensive or ""problematic"" content.

But tech firms claim a First Amendment right as private entities to editorially regulate the billions of daily voices on their platforms — from political discourse and recipe sharing, to incitement and obscenity.

GOP AGS ASK SUPREME COURT TO PEEL BACK CONTENT MODERATION FROM BIG TECH IN LANDMARK FIRST AMENDMENT CASES

Justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum openly questioned whether the regulations would make it impossible for private companies to operate as a forum for free speech and expression.

""It covers almost everything,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor of Florida's law, which she said would affect what the arts and crafts retailer Etsy would have to allow on its digital marketplace. ""That's viewpoint discrimination. This falls under a whole lot of your listings and bans and disclosure requirements. Why are we imposing that on something like this?""

""The First Amendment restricts what the government can do,"" Chief Justice John Roberts told Texas' solicitor general. ""What the government’s doing here is saying 'you must do this, you must carry these people — you’ve got to explain if you don’t.' That’s not the First Amendment.""

But there was widespread unease about the best approach they should take at this stage.

Some justices suggested large companies that host wide-ranging speech platforms may be able to exercise greater editorial control, but that e-commerce sites like Etsy, Venmo, and Uber could be regulated by the states to some extent.

""This is a sprawling statute and it makes me a little bit nervous,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, over how a court opinion could be applied across the infinite variety of digital media. She said the competing interests ""had a bunch of landmines.""

Others on the bench wondered what the effect the big tech companies have on public discourse.

""There's a lot of new terminology bouncing around in these cases, and just out of curiosity — and one of them is content moderation,"" said Justice Samuel Alito. ""is it anything more a euphemism for censorship?""

JAN 6 RIOTERS, ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS: A LOOK AHEAD AT LANDMARK CASES SCOTUS WILL HEAR IN 2024

Alito also warned about resisting ""the Orwellian temptation to recategorize offensive conduct in seemingly bland terms.""

The Florida law would block a social media platform from engaging in censoring, prioritizing, or so-called ""shadow banning"" ""based on the content."" It also would prevent ""willfully deplatforming a candidate"" for public office for material posted by or about that candidate.

Both Florida and Texas would also require those companies to notify a user when their content has been modified or edited, along with an explanation for that action.

The states argue social media companies have outsized influence over what news and information the public sees, and say they have a long tradition of ensuring their citizens have full access to a range of viewpoints, calling social media platforms the new ""digital public square.""

The Florida and Texas laws were passed shortly after Twitter/X and Facebook separately removed Trump for their platforms, for his posts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots by his supporters.

Trump and a coalition of Republican-led states are among those filing separate amicus briefs supporting Florida and Texas

The Biden administration has opposed the state laws.

GOP SENATOR URGES SCOTUS TO REIN IN BIG TECH'S CONTENT CENSORSHIP THAT DEFIES 'LOGIC'

Trade groups representing big tech companies told the court the laws violate their free speech rights to decide what content meets their policies — saying their forums should not be an open-ended portal for offensive or dangerous speech — including school bullying, harassment, terrorist ideology, racial hatred, medical misinformation and voter fraud.

In almost four hours of oral arguments stretching well into the afternoon, the justices weighed whether to offer a sweeping ruling on the First Amendment implications of the state laws, or a more limited approach that might have the lower courts take another look at how those content moderation policies would be applied.

""Why isn't that a classic First Amendment violation for the state to come in and say, 'We're not going to allow you to enforce those sorts of restrictions?'"" asked Justice Elena Kagan.

""In your opening remarks,' Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked of Florida's Solicitor General Henry Whitaker, ""you said the design of the First Amendment is to prevent ‘suppression of speech.’ And you left out what I understand to be three key words in the First Amendment or to describe the First Amendment, 'by the government,'"" with Kavanaugh suggesting private companies should be given broader latitude to moderate their users content.

Attorneys for the states told the court that social media companies lack free speech protection since they only ""host"" viewpoints, similar to the telecommunications industry — known as ""common carriers"" — which transmits speech with no editorial oversight.

""Separating the wheat from the chaff here is pretty difficult,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch.

Justice Clarence Thomas, who light-heartedly noted he was the only member of the court who pre-dated the widespread use of the Internet was especially animated in his extensive bench remarks on the implications, asking tough questions of both sides.

""What do you do if it's a deep-learning algorithm which teaches itself and has very little human intervention?"" he asked at one point. ""So who's speaking then, the algorithm or the person?""

After the arguments, Florida Gov. Ron De Santis — on Twitter/X no less — said, ""We're gonna make sure we're doing everything we can to ensure people have a right to speak in these public forums. We want more speech, not less speech.""

These cases are just the latest in what is shaping up a busy term on the digital front at the Supreme Court.

The justices in March will hear an appeal from GOP-controlled states over whether federal government efforts to combat disinformation online violate the free speech rights of users on social media platforms.

Here too, those states say conservative political views are being silenced, after pressure on social media firms by the Biden administration.

And the justices have already heard arguments over whether public officials can block critical comments on their social media accounts from constituents.

Rulings in the cases argued Monday, Moody v. NetChoice, LLC and NetChoice, LLC v. Paxton, are expected by late June.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Former President Donald Trump claims that his wife Melania is expected to make more regular public appearances on the campaign trail.

Trump made the remarks during his interview at a Fox News townhall earlier this week with host Laura Ingraham.

""It’s funny, she was a very successful model, very, very successful, and yet she was a private person. She’s going to be out a lot. Not because she likes doing it, but she likes the results,"" he said Tuesday. ""She wants to see this country really succeed. She loves the country.""

TRUMP SAYS IT'S 'CRAZY' HOW CHRISTIANS, PEOPLE OF FAITH CAN VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS

""You know, a lot of first ladies would go out — they want to be everywhere. They get angry at their husband because he’s not introducing them,"" Trump continued. ""If I didn’t introduce Melania, she’d be very happy about it. She’s just a different kind of a person.""

Melania has been largely absent from her husband's 2024 presidential bid thus far, making few public appearances and staying out of the media.

Her absence, until recently, has been explained by the passing of her mother, Amalija Knavs, earlier this year. But as the campaign season becomes more intense, political commentators have questioned whether she will step back into efforts supporting Trump.

Trump also expressed appreciation that Melania has been dedicated to raising their son, Barron Trump.

""Her life revolves around that boy. It’s so important to her,"" Trump said. ""At the same time, it also revolves around our country and the success of our country. She’s raised a lot of money for charity. She’s a private person.""

""And she loves the country,"" Trump added. ""She’s going to be out a lot, but she does it for the good of the country, not for her. She’s somebody with a lot of confidence. She doesn’t need that.""

Trump's Fox News town hall came four days before South Carolina's Republican presidential primary, which commences Saturday.

The latest public opinion polls indicate that he maintains a very large double-digit lead over former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last major rival for the GOP nomination.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden told reporters on Wednesday that his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center went ""great,"" tamping down concerns over his health as the presidential election draws near.

Biden had just finished delivering remarks on how his administration’s policies on fighting crime in communities across the country are working when one reporter can be heard shouting if there’s anything Americans should know following his annual doctor’s visit.

""Well, they think I look too young,"" Biden replied.

Biden assured reporters that ""everything’s great"" regarding the check-up and that ""there is nothing different than last year.""

JACK SMITH RESPONDS TO BLISTERING HUR REPORT FOR FIRST TIME, SAYS BIDEN, TRUMP CASES NOT SIMILAR

Biden had revealed earlier Wednesday that he was making an unannounced trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a physical exam.

The exam comes after the report from Special Counsel Robert Hur that claimed the president had significant memory issues.

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, does not believe a cognitive test is necessary. She said O'Connor believes Biden proves his cognitive ability ""every day [in] how he operates and how he thinks.""

EX-OBAMA AIDES SAY AGE IS ‘VERY REAL ISSUE’ FOR BIDEN, WHO SOUNDS ‘FRAIL,’ ‘MUMBLY’

Biden received his last physical on Feb. 16 of last year, when his physician gave him a clean bill of health in a letter that said Biden was ""fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.""

Biden has undergone yearly physical examinations since the beginning of his term, in line with every other commander in chief since President Richard Nixon.

The Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the Global Times, touted President Biden and his campaign's use of TikTok, and critiqued the ""deep hypocrisy"" of America's politicians who call the social media platform a national security threat.

The opinion article in the CCP's state media said that Biden's campaign use of TikTok ""highlights the unjust suppression"" and ""proves the hype nonsense.""

""As a social media app that has been heavily portrayed by the US as a ‘national security threat,' TikTok being used by Biden's campaign highlights the unjust suppression of TikTok by American politicians and proves the hype nonsense,"" the article said.

BIG TECH FACES BRUTAL QUESTIONING ON CAPITOL HILL OVER CONTENT HARMING KIDS

The Global Times argued that the short-form video social media platform has become a ""necessary means"" for American politicians to reach young voters.

Citing a 2023 survey report by the Pew Research Center, the Global Times said that about one-third (32 percent) of young Americans aged 18 to 29 say they regularly get their news from TikTok.

The CCP newspaper said that American politicians are ""very self-contradictory when it comes to TikTok.""

The article argued that the Biden campaign's use of TikTok proves that the social media platform is not a national security threat and proves the ""deep hypocrisy"" of American politicians.

""In the end, we are witnessing that Washington's behavior toward TikTok is unacceptable to the public and society, so politicians have to choose to compromise for votes,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.

Jake Denton, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center, told Fox News Digital that Biden's ""hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats"" posed by TikTok.

President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America. — Jake Denton, Research Associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center

""Once again, President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America,"" Denton said. ""By choosing to use TikTok for his reelection campaign, he is callously disregarding warnings from both parties and national security experts that this Chinese-controlled technology imperils our national security through invasive data gathering and its ties to the CCP.""

""We cannot let one man’s thirst for social media virality and votes endanger our country,"" Denton said. ""The President must put America before his personal electoral interests, immediately delete TikTok, and join the bipartisan efforts to ban the app from operating on American soil.""

The Biden campaign's TikTok video sparked outrage after the administration banned the Chinese-owned app from federal devices over security concerns.

TIKTOK CEO GRILLED ON CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY INFLUENCE, SEARCHES OF TAYLOR SWIFT VS. TIANANMEN SQUARE

Last February, the administration set a 30-day deadline for government agencies to purge the app from federal devices.

The social media platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is popular among younger Americans.

Biden previously joined forces with TikTok influencers amid his re-election run, and the Democratic National Committee also joined the platform.

The president's campaign joining the Beijing-based social media platform could present unique security risks.

The Senate passed a stopgap measure Thursday night to avoid a government shutdown, which would have begun on Saturday, the first funding deadline for appropriations bills as laid out in the previous two-pronged spending bill.

Senators voted 77-13 to pass the continuing resolution, making the chamber aligned with the House. The bill now goes to President Biden to sign.

The continuing resolution passed the House earlier in the day, by a vote of 320-99. The bill moves funding deadlines to March 8 and March 22, rather than March 1 and March 8 initially agreed upon.

""We are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Wednesday, along with House Appropriations Committee Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine.

According to the lawmakers, six funding bills each for Agriculture-FDA, Commerce-Justice and Science, Energy and Water Development, Interior, Military Construction-VA, and Transportation-HUD will be taken up for votes and enacted ahead of the first deadline on March 8.

Negotiators are in agreement on the first six measures, which will be guided by both the Fiscal Responsibility Act discretionary spending limits, as well as the January topline spending agreement, per the statement. The deal laid out a $1.6 trillion topline amount for spending in the fiscal year, with $886 billion allotted for defense spending and $704 billion for non-defense purposes.

An additional slate of six bills, including those for Defense, Financial Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS, Legislative Branch, and State and Foreign Operations, are set to be agreed upon, taken up for votes, and signed into law ahead of the later March 22 deadline.

The latest continuing resolution is the fourth such extension since the Congress's failure to pass separate appropriations bills by the Sept. 30 deadline. It now heads to President Biden's desk for a signature to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.

EXCLUSIVE: Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican leader, is endorsing former President Trump for reelection.

It’s a key win for Trump from the establishment wing of the Republican Party. The South Dakota Republican is Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s top deputy in the Senate GOP.

""The primary results in South Carolina make clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president in this year’s pivotal presidential election. The choice before the American people is crystal clear: It’s Donald Trump or Joe Biden,"" Thune told Fox News Digital.

TRUMP MOVES CLOSER TO LOCKING UP GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WITH 20-POINT WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA

""I support former President Trump's campaign to win the presidency, and I intend to do everything I can to see that he has a Republican majority in the Senate working with him to restore American strength at home and abroad,"" he continued.

""Together we must put an end to the disastrous Biden-Schumer agenda. Our country cannot endure another four years of Bidenomics, continued lawlessness at our southern border, and American weakness on the global stage.""

Thune and Trump spoke by phone on Saturday night after Trump’s commanding victory in the South Carolina Republican primary, a source familiar with the call told Fox News Digital.

It wasn’t clear before now whether Thune, who’s seen as one of McConnell’s potential successors to lead the Senate Republican Conference, would endorse either of the two major candidates for the 2024 GOP nomination.

ONLY ON FOX: WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT HALEY AFTER TOPPING HER IN HER HOME STATE

Like McConnell, he suggested he would support whoever Republican voters chose as their presidential nominee, but Thune has for the most part avoided mentioning the former president.

He previously endorsed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott’s presidential campaign and was present at Scott’s launch event. Scott dropped out in November and endorsed Trump last month.

The Sunday announcement puts added pressure on McConnell, who has brushed off scrutiny on whether his frosty relationship with Trump would stop him from endorsing the ex-president in the Republican primary.

McConnell said at a press conference this month when asked about the race, ""I've stayed essentially out of it, and when I change my mind about that, I'll let you know.""

Both Thune and McConnell were targeted by Trump for criticizing his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and the 2020 election.

Thune won a landslide reelection victory for a fourth Senate term in 2022 despite Trump calling for a primary challenger against him.

His endorsement of the former president comes after Trump beat former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state primary on Saturday night. The ex-president won roughly 60% of the vote compared to 40% for Haley.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

FIRST ON FOX: A House Republican who has been critical of rushing to impeach President Biden is calling for his removal over questions about his mental fitness for the job.

Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told Fox News Digital that he plans to introduce a resolution on Monday to call on Biden’s Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution.

His most-cited reason was Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents. The report did not recommend any charges for the president but repeatedly painted him as an aging leader with a poor memory.

Buck said the report ""addressed what many Americans have long witnessed with their own eyes – that President Biden is no longer fit to successfully discharge the critical duties of his office.""

JAMES BIDEN SAYS HIS BROTHER 'HAS NEVER HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT' OR ANY 'FINANCIAL INTEREST' IN BUSINESS VENTURES

""Numerous instances were articulated in the report, and have played out in full public view, showing President Biden’s apparent cognitive decline and lack of mental stamina,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""The societal challenges and security threats our country faces are innumerable and require a chief executive with both strong mental and physical faculties. The time has come for the vice president and the Cabinet to put our country first and move forward on invoking the 25th Amendment.""

DEVON ARCHER: HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA EXECS ‘CALLED DC’ TO GET UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR FIRED

In his resolution text, Buck also cited Biden’s verbal stumbles and public gaffes as evidence of mental decline. It pointed out that Biden recently confused French President Emmanuel Macron with a predecessor who died decades prior, and that he also mixed up German leaders’ names and mistakenly referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico.

Biden and his allies have vigorously denied that his mental acuity is suffering.

But Buck’s resolution is a significant addition to the growing pressure for Biden officials to address scrutiny over the president’s mental fitness.

The Colorado Republican, who is retiring at the end of this term, is one of the few House GOP lawmakers who have publicly expressed wariness over the push to impeach Biden over allegations that he and his family’s businesses profited off of his political weight.

Buck voted along with the rest of the House GOP Conference to formalize the Biden impeachment inquiry in December, but just last week he criticized the probe’s leaders for relying on allegations made by FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who was recently indicted for lying to the bureau.

""We’ve always been looking for a link between what Hunter Biden received in terms of money and Joe Biden’s activities or Joe Biden receiving money. This clearly is not a credible link at this point,"" Buck said in a CNN interview.

He told the network in September, ""I want to make sure we don’t ruin this institution over a tit-for-tat impeachment. If the evidence is there… I will absolutely vote for impeachment. I don’t see the evidence at this point.""

Section 4 of the 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the White House Cabinet to declare the president unfit to perform his duties, transferring power to the vice president.

The president is able to take those powers back by writing to Congress that he is able to serve. The Cabinet would then have four days to refute that, after which Congress would vote on whether the president could remain in power.

Buck is one of several Republican lawmakers who have called for the constitutional amendment to be invoked in the wake of Hur's report, including Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, as well as Reps. Mary Miller, R-Ill., and Mike Collins, R-Ga.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment on Buck's resolution.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.

""This is a Joe Biden invasion,"" Trump said of the border crisis.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Colorado state legislature advanced a bill on Friday aimed at mandating K-12 schools statewide to implement policies requiring educators to address transgender students by their preferred name in all school settings – including in records and documents – independent of parental approval or a formal legal name change.

The bill will need one more round of voting before advancing to the Senate floor.

House Bill 1039 — a bill largely backed by the progressive group Colorado Youth Advisory Council — would also impact charter schools and mandates that educators use students' non-legal names in all school-related functions, including extracurricular activities, rosters, attendance lists, yearbooks and student ID cards.

In its proposal to lawmakers, the youth council said many ""school administrative systems cause humiliation for transgender Colorado youth when schools use the students’ deadnames (birth names that do not align with their gender identities).""

INDIANA PARENTS WARN NATION AFTER CHILD IS REMOVED FROM HOME FOR IMPROPER PRONOUN USAGE: ‘CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE’

""When schools keep a student’s former name and gender marker on school transcripts and records, it outs transgender students to their peers, thereby violating their privacy,"" the group wrote prior to the legislature's vote.

One Colorado, a progressive LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, also supports the bill, alongside the Colorado School Counselors Association.

The bill would also deem that ""intentional use of a name other than a student's chosen name is discriminatory.""

State Rep. Anthony Hartsook, a Republican, called the bill ""open-ended and ill-defined"" that could lead to ""many, many paths.""

""We open up Pandora's Box for discernment on what is discriminatory and what is not, what is intentional and what is not,"" Hatsook said on the House floor. ""Who starts deciding that when and where do we start deciding that? When and where do we bring the parents into that discussion?""

CAMPUS RELIGIOUS GROUPS REPORT GREATER INTEREST FROM STUDENTS TRYING TO FIND MEANING IN ‘CRUMBLING’ CULTURE

Republican State Rep. Brandi Bradley agreed with Hartsook and urged colleagues to vote ""no"" on the legislation.

""And now we have told the teachers that they're being discriminatory,"" Bradley said of the bill. ""I have four teenagers. They are awesome kids, but sometimes they like to play games. So tell me how codifying or putting this bill in is not going to go against teachers and their rights in a field where we already have so much shortage?""

Republican State Rep. Rose Pugliese added she does not want schools to know more about her kids than she does.

""Parents have the right to know,"" said Pugliese.

Other Republican lawmakers argued students would be allowed to change their names more than once, furthering burdening teachers to remember their new names.

Meanwhile, State Rep. Stephanie Vigil, a Colorado Springs Democrat co-sponsoring the bill, contended that some transgender kids who may not have come out to their parents yet would be in danger if the legislation is not approved. On the other hand, parents who support their transgender children would also have their parental rights usurped if they approve of the name change.

RESEARCHERS ARGUE ‘RAPID ONSET GENDER DYSPHORIA’ DOES EXIST, DESPITE NARRATIVE AGAINST IT

""And so I would just suggest to you all as we talk through this bill today that we bear in mind that there is such a thing as a kid who's not safe with their own parents,"" said Vigil. ""Certainly, kids belong with their parents – that relationship is precious. But I do not accept the premise that a child is anyone's property or that their safety isn't to be prioritized, even when the person who is a danger to them is their own parents.""

The bill was also sponsored by Democratic State Sens. Faith Winter, of Westminster, and Janice Marchman, of Loveland. State Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat and the legislature's only transgender member, is also a co-sponsor.

If cleared by the Senate and signed by the governor, the bill would go into effect in July 2025.

Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah are several states that have passed laws restricting pronoun use in schools.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Ahead of President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday, the White House debuted a new term for illegal immigrants arriving in the country, calling them ""newcomers.""

Biden will travel to Brownsville, Texas, in an effort to reassure voters who have soured on his handling of the border crisis. Republicans have lambasted the Biden administration for weak enforcement of immigration laws, and a recent poll showed that just 26% of Americans approved of the president's job on immigration.

The language the White House used to describe the crisis may not alleviate voters' concerns. In a fact sheet distributed by the White House press office to advocate for the bipartisan border agreement Biden has endorsed, officials pointed out that the bill includes $1.4 billion ""for cities and states who are providing critical services to newcomers.""

BIDEN'S BORDER VISIT LANDS ON ONE OF THE LEAST TRAFFICKED TOWNS, WHILE TRUMP IS HEADED INTO THE THICK OF IT

The reference to illegal immigrants as ""newcomers"" — which suggests equal status to migrants who come to the U.S. legally — provoked a swift condemnation from House Republicans.

""The Biden White House is now referring to illegal immigrants as ‘newcomers.’ Joe Biden is not serious about stopping the illegal immigration into the United States. This is a catastrophe by design,"" the House GOP conference posted on X.

White House officials have shot back at their GOP critics several times in recent weeks, asserting that if Republican lawmakers were serious about securing the border, they would support the bipartisan legislation President Biden has endorsed.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATIONS OF 36 STATES

The border bill negotiated in the Senate would increase Border Patrol staff and tighten asylum rules, expand law enforcement's authority to tackle fentanyl smuggling and increase funding to cities and states receiving asylum seekers.

Republicans argued the bill would normalize high levels of illegal immigration and do little to stop the flow of people and drugs over the border.

""We have done the work to make sure we're dealing with a broken immigration system. The Republicans have gotten in the way. They have gotten in the way,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday on CNN.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

""And so look, this is a serious matter, that‘s why the president is going to the border. The president was at the border a year ago in El Paso, visiting the border back in January 2023. He put a comprehensive, a comprehensive immigration policy on day one,"" she added.

Biden's choice of Brownsville for his border visit is an area that has seen comparatively small numbers of migrant crossings in Texas.

CBP data shows that Brownsville has seen just 46 migrant encounters over the past five days, compared to 2,106 in Eagle Pass. The former averaged 17 migrant encounters per day in February, while the latter averaged 462.

Brownsville is part of the CBP's Rio Grande Valley sector, which has seen 87,426 migrant encounters so far in FY 2024. The Del Rio sector that encompasses Eagle Pass has seen 182,077 encounters, but even that is far below the busiest sector, which lies around Tucson, Arizona, and has seen 297,380 encounters.

Former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, will visit Eagle Pass on Thursday in a competing visit, one of the most heavily trafficked areas in Texas and ground zero for Gov. Greg Abbott's fight with the Biden administration over enforcing immigration law.

Harris made the statement during a a recent interview last week before the Thursday release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on Biden's mishandling of classified documents, which described the president’s memory as having ""significant limitations.""

""I am ready to serve. There’s no question about that,"" Harris told The Wall Street Journal, adding that everyone who observes her work ""walks away fully aware of my capacity to lead.""

BIDEN CONSIDERED RESIGNING VICE PRESIDENCY ‘IN PROTEST’ OVER OBAMA'S AFGHANISTAN POLICY: HUR REPORT

Hur's report recommended no charges against Biden over his actions pertaining to the mishandling of classified documents, partly because he would have a defense at trial as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""

Republicans piled on Biden following the Hur report's release last week, but Democrats have also begun voicing — or at least admitting — greater concern surrounding Biden's age and whether that could hurt his chances at winning re-election this year.

Former President Bill Clinton's lead strategist, James Carville, argued Saturday that the White House has little confidence in Biden after he turned down a Super Bowl Sunday interview.

TREASURY CONFIRMS TERMS LIKE ‘MAGA,’ TRUMP,' KAMALA,' ‘BIDEN’ USED IN PRIVATE BANK TRANSACTION SEARCHES

""It’s the biggest television audience, not even close, and you get a chance to do a 20-25-minute interview on that day,"" Carville said. ""And you don’t do it? That’s a kind of sign that the staff, or yourself, doesn’t have much confidence in you. There’s no other way to read this.""

Another former Clinton strategist, Paul Begala, said Hur’s indictment of Biden’s memory and Biden's subsequent response was ""terrible for Democrats.""

""Oh yeah. Look, I’m a Biden supporter, and I slept like a baby last night: I woke up every two hours crying and wet the bed,"" Begala quipped on CNN last Friday. ""This is terrible for Democrats. And anybody with a functioning brain knows that,"" he declared.

The Biden administration finalized energy efficiency regulations targeting residential clothes washers and dryers in an effort to curb carbon emissions, as part of its broad climate agenda.

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced the final rules, which it projected will collectively save American households $2.2 billion per year on utility bills while reducing nearly 71 million metric tons of ""dangerous carbon dioxide emissions"" over the next three decades. DOE's regulations targeting the popular home appliances are slightly scaled down compared to the agency's draft proposal issued a year ago.

""For decades, DOE’s appliance standards actions for clothes washers and dryers have provided loads of savings for American families while also decreasing harmful carbon emissions,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.

""With strong support from industry leaders and consumer advocates, DOE will continue to roll out innovative appliance solutions throughout 2024 to lower costs for the American people — continuing the cycle of household savings that are the backbone of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,"" she continued.

BIDEN ADMIN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TARGETING HOME APPLIANCES WITH ECO REGULATIONS IN 2023

Under the regulations, certain less-efficient models of washers and dryers will be barred from being sold, according to DOE.

The clothes washers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 0.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 3% compared to the profile of models currently on the market. And the dryers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 2.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 11% compared to products on the market now.

BIDEN ADMIN BACKS OFF GAS STOVE CRACKDOWN AFTER WIDESPREAD PUSHBACK

DOE said the regulations largely reflect an agreement issued in September by environmental groups and industry associations.

""Standards at these levels will significantly reduce household energy bills and planet-warming emissions, period,"" Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said after the agreement was reached at the time.

""Swiftly establishing standards at these strong levels will allow the Department of Energy to continue to make progress with the highly successful efficiency standards program — which already saves the average household $500 annually on their energy bills,"" added Natural Resources Defense Council staff attorney Joe Vukovich.

BIDEN ADMIN'S WAR ON HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES WILL CAUSE HIGHER PRICES, DIRTIER CLOTHES AND DISHES, EXPERTS WARN

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) — which heavily criticized DOE's original proposal last year on washers and dryers — also signed onto the agreement. AHAM CEO Kelly Mariotti said in September that the compromise regulations would allow ""manufacturers to continue to offer a complete range of energy-efficient products.""

""What we're learning is that the government ought to get out of the business of doing these regulations,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""And not try to just float really extreme ones and then come up with something that's less extreme.""

""The main concern with these negotiated rulemakings is that it mostly involves the manufacturers and the energy efficiency activists,"" he added. ""One wonders how much the interests of consumers are taken into account during this process.""

The new standards for washers and dryers, meanwhile, are the latest in a long string of energy efficiency regulations unveiled by DOE over the last 12 months. Climate activists have argued such regulations are necessary to combat global warming, noting that the commercial and residential sector accounts for the largest share of total end-use carbon emissions of any sector in the U.S.

However, Republican lawmakers and free market advocates have argued the rules restrict consumer choice and lead to increased upfront costs.

""DOE should be looking for ways to address the problems caused by the existing washing machine regulations rather than making things worse with tougher new regulations,"" Lieberman told Fox News Digital.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Catch me at the border

President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday reflects his wishful thinking on the issue, arriving at one of the least-trafficked towns on the border.

Biden will visit Brownsville, Texas, which ranks as the 29th-most trafficked town by illegal border-crossers, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Former President Trump, meanwhile, is set to hold a competing visit to the border, though he will arrive at Eagle Pass, Texas, one of the most heavily-trafficked towns in the country.

Biden's trip to Texas is an attempt to address his deep unpopularity on the issue, with a recent poll showing just 26% of Americans support his handling of the border.

The White House says Biden will use the visit to renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing at the border as well as tightening asylum rules, moved to tackle fentanyl smuggling, and increased funding to communities and NGOs receiving migrants. Republicans argued it fell well short of what is necessary.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.

While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November.

Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says ""the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.""

""I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,"" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'

Smith’s ""primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,"" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, ""there might not be a trial.""

Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a ""host"" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as ""motivated"" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall.

Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.

HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Manual states, ""Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.

""Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,"" Turley said.

John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.



""If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,"" Shu said. ""It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.

""The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.""

""This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,"" Shu added.

On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, ""Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.""

But, Turley said, ""the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.""

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

""The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,"" Turley said.

""The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection.

""So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.""

Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said ""the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.""

""But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,"" Trusty said.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

A New York judge presiding over former President Donald Trump’s civil fraud case has denied his legal team’s request to avoid paying a $355 million penalty in the case.

Trump lawyers had asked Judge Arthur Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an ""orderly post-judgement process.""

In an email to the defendants posted Thursday to the court docket, Engoron said they had ""failed to explain, much less justify, any basis for a stay.""

""I am confident that the Appellate Division will protect your appellate rights,"" he wrote.

Last week, Trump was barred from operating his business in New York for three years and was found liable for $355 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

HAYLEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: ‘LET’S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

James said Monday she was prepared to seize Trump's assets if he is unable to pay the massive judgment handed down in his civil fraud case.

Trump could be at risk of losing some of his prized properties if he can't pay his staggering New York civil fraud penalty. With interest, he owes the state nearly $454 million — and the amount is going up $87,502 each day until he pays.

Engoron concluded that Trump lied for years about his wealth as he built the real estate empire that vaulted him to stardom and the White House. Trump denies wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal.

Trump's ability to pay his mounting legal debts is increasingly murky after back-to-back courtroom losses. In January, a jury ordered him to pay $83.3 million for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.

Trump claimed last year that he has about $400 million in cash — reserves that would get eaten up by his court penalties. The rest of his net worth, which he says is several billion dollars, is tied up in golf courses, skyscrapers, and other properties, along with investments and other holdings.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.""

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said.

Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.

SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY

Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.

NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,"" a spokesperson said. ""He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.""

Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.

GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered ""no"" when asked if ""undocumented immigrants"" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.

In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.

But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are ""inherently more unsafe.""

""It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.

""Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,"" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.

""But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,"" he said.

""And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,"" he said.

There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel will formally resign her position after the March 5 Super Tuesday primaries, weeks after former President Trump asked her to step down.

The announcement comes weeks after Trump revealed his recommendations for changes within the RNC earlier this month. He proposed that North Carolina GOP chair Michael Whatley take over as chairman, while his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita also receive leadership positions.

""It has been the honor and privilege of my life to serve the Republican National Committee for seven years as Chairwoman to elect Republicans and grow our Party,"" McDaniel said in a statement. ""I have decided to step aside at our Spring Training on March 8 in Houston to allow our nominee to select a Chair of their choosing. The RNC has historically undergone change once we have a nominee and it has always been my intention to honor that tradition.""

""I remain committed to winning back the White House and electing Republicans up and down the ballot in November,"" she added, before thanking her husband, family and RNC staff.

As he has moved closer to securing the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has been ramping up his calls for changes and new leadership at the GOP's national party committee.

TRUMP RECOMMENDS NORTH CAROLINA GOP CHAIR WHATLEY TO REPLACE MCDANIEL AT RNC: SOURCE

The former president met with McDaniel at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida in early February.

Trump wrote in his Truth Social platform following the meeting that McDaniel was a ""friend"" but that he would be urging changes at the RNC after the Feb. 24 South Carolina GOP presidential primary.

McDaniel was nominated by Trump soon after his presidential election victory in 2016, and she won re-election in 2019, 2021, and January of last year.

Gov. Kathy Hochul has called on online map and social media companies to stop listing unlicensed cannabis dispensaries.

Yelp said the company believes ""consumers have a First Amendment right to read and write about all businesses, even if unlicensed.""

After failing to wipe illegal cannabis dispensaries off the map, New York is asking online sites to hide them.

Since the state legalized marijuana in 2021, unlicensed pot shops have proliferated across New York City, with limited pushback from authorities. On Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul called on online map and social media companies to stop listing them.

""If you type in ‘cannabis dispensaries’ in Google Maps or Yelp, you’ll get a long list of unlicensed illegal vendors,"" Hochul, a Democrat, said Tuesday, speaking to reporters alongside some of the owners of licensed, legal weed stores that make up a tiny minority of the cannabis shops in New York City.

FEDERAL JUDGE GREEN LIGHTS NEW YORK MARIJUANA LICENSING DESPITE 'DISASTER' LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET ROLLOUT

In a statement, Yelp said the company believes ""consumers have a First Amendment right to read and write about all businesses, even if unlicensed.""

""Allowing users to contribute and see information ... about unlicensed businesses serves the public interest and provides a resource for regulators to determine whether any particular business has appropriate licenses,"" the statement read.

Legal marijuana shops in New York pay a vice tax, purchase from local farms, and submit to quality control testing to ensure their products aren’t laced with other drugs and aren’t stronger or weaker than their label says.

NEW YORK GOV. KATHY HOCHUL PROPOSES LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL POT SHOPS

But so far, fewer than 80 cannabis licensed stores have opened around the state, where strict eligibility requirements and lawsuits have contributed to slowing the rollout. Meanwhile, it’s common for a single neighborhood in New York City to have a dozen illegal ones.

Hochul vowed to crack down eight months ago, but has failed to make noticeable progress.

Aiming to avoid an echo of prohibition-era criminalization of drug sales, New York state’s marijuana legalization doesn’t include severe criminal punishment for illegal sales and doesn’t allow most law enforcement agencies to enforce pot laws.

Legislation that Hochul signed last May gave the state powers for inspections, seizures, fines that can reach $20,000 a day and, in some cases, close shops and go after landlords.

But the governor on Wednesday said she has since learned that it wasn't enough. She said the fines aren't high enough to deter people, and noted the appeals process takes many months, allowing shops to continue raking in tax-free profits off unlicensed products that are less expensive because they can be purchased out of state.

New York City itself has tried to stem the tide by going after landlords, but Mayor Eric Adams has been imploring Albany to grant the city more power to respond.

Hochul has asked the Democrat-controlled state Legislature to pass new legislation to grant more enforcement authority to city agencies, increase fines, and give law enforcement permission to shut down illegal stores before the appeals process plays out.

In the meantime, Hochul is asking tech companies ""to not be posting the sites that are illegal and ensure that they’re posting the legal shops.""

Local cannabis entrepreneur Osbert Orduña said Google Maps keeps delisting his legal shops, one in New Jersey, and another in Queens, New York. He said he’s never had trouble with his listings on Yelp, though he’d like the site to delist illegal operators as well.

NEW YORK LAWMAKERS CONSIDER ADDING POT SHOP CRACKDOWN TO OVERDUE BUDGET

""Four times, Google has taken us down off of their platform for ‘violating their terms of service.’ We’ve done nothing other than have our store hours and our basic business information listed,"" he said.

Google didn't immediately respond to a query about Orduña's specific circumstances, but noted in a statement responding to Hochul's comments that it does remove listings for closed venues.

""If we can confirm that a business has closed for any reason – including license issues – we’ll reflect that it’s closed in the listing. We also prohibit cannabis ads in New York and remove them upon detection, often before they ever run,"" the statement read.

Orduña said he also wants his illegal competitors, some of whom he knows personally, to be closed down. He says they tell him he's playing a ""sucker's game."" But as a former Marine, he likes to do things by the book and even plans on expanding to open another store in Queens next week.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

""This is an open primary,"" Haley emphasized in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview this week.

The former two-term Palmetto State governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in the former president's administration notes that ""anybody can vote in the primary, as long as you didn't vote in the Democrat primary on February 3rd in South Carolina.""

LIVE UPDATES: SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRIMARY

Trump is the 2024 GOP frontrunner as he bids a third straight time for the White House. He grabbed a majority of the votes last month in Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary victories and won by a landslide earlier this month in the Nevada and U.S. Virgin Island caucuses to close in on locking up the nomination.

HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL WIN THE NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: ‘LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

The final polls in South Carolina showed Trump maintaining a large double-digit lead over Haley, the last remaining major rival challenging the former president.

Independents helped fuel Haley's 43% showing in New Hampshire, where she lost to Trump by 11 points. But while independent voters have long played a crucial and influential role in the first-in-the-nation primary, they are much less of a factor in South Carolina's more conservative electorate, where evangelical voters enjoy prominence in GOP contests.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS ‘A**-KICKING' FOR HALEY IN HER HOME STATE, BUT SHE SAYS ‘I REFUSE TO QUIT’

A Monmouth University poll about South Carolina's primary conducted last weekend had Trump with a 72%-to-25% lead among Republicans questioned, similar to how he performed with GOP voters in New Hampshire. Haley, meanwhile, held a narrow 53%-46% advantage among independents.

The problem for Haley is nearly two-thirds of those sampled by the survey indicated they were Republicans, with only 28% identifying as independents.

Longtime South Carolina-based Republican consultant Dave Wilson, who remains neutral in the primary, noted ""there is no party registration in this state.""

""They're targeting what would be considered independent or swing voters. There's just not that many in South Carolina. You're either an R or a D in this state,"" Wilson said, addressing Haley's campaign efforts.

He added the Haley campaign and aligned groups are ""trying to find people who are so against Donald Trump that they're willing to step into a Republican booth and choose her name just to vote against Trump.""

Haley's allies are also making a pitch for Democrats who didn't cast a ballot in the party's relatively low turnout presidential primary earlier this month to vote in the GOP contest.

HALEY ACCUSES TRUMP OF SIDING WITH A DICTATOR AND TYRANT'

""If you did not vote in the February 3rd Democratic primary, you are eligible to vote on February 24th."" a mailer sent to Democratic voters by the Haley-aligned super PAC SFA Fund states.

""Your vote can make a difference,"" the mailer emphasized. ""Please participate by voting for Nikki Haley and make your voice heard.""

Haley has repeatedly vowed to march on regardless of her finish on Saturday. Michigan, on Tuesday, holds the next contest, and it's also an open primary.

In early March, nearly 800 delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday, and over 150 will be at stake over the ensuing two weeks. Among the states holding contests on Super Tuesday are delegate-rich California and Texas, and other big states like Florida, Illinois and Ohio will hold winner-take-all primaries March 19. Polling in many of those states indicates Trump holding large leads over Haley.

But Haley's campaign notes that 11 of the 16 Super Tuesday contests aren't limited to registered Republicans.

Campaign manager Betsy Ankeny in a recent memo highlighted that the upcoming open primaries contain ""significant fertile ground for Nikki.""

Trump and his allies have repeatedly blasted Haley over the courting of independents and even some Democrats.

""The Democrats are giving her money, and she's playing into the game. And I think she just can't get, she just can't get herself to get out. She is doing poorly in the polls. Look, if she was doing well, I'd understand it, but she's doing very poorly,"" Trump said Tuesday in a Fox News town hall in Greenville, South Carolina.

Haley, in an interview the next morning on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom,"" fired back.

TRUMP RUNNING MATE AUDITIONS ON THE SOUTH CAROLINA CAMPAIGN TRAIL

""He can keep saying I have big Democrat donors. At the same time, look at his disclosures. But I don't ask donors whether they're Republican, Democrat or independent,"" she said.

""We're fighting for the Republican primary, but there are a lot of independents who left the Republican Party because of Donald Trump. We are pulling them back. … We're pulling Reagan Democrats back. And Republicans need to remember this is not about pushing people out of our party. And that's why I do well with everybody, not just Republicans, not just independents.""

Seasoned Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams pointed out that ""it's up to each state to choose its process. … That's generally been a principle of states' rights that Republicans have long supported.""

Williams, a veteran of Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, noted that when Romney won the nomination a dozen years ago ""we were essentially the establishment and tried to draw in independents to offset what seemed to be a rotation of conservative challengers.

""We courted independent voters, and we had an eye on the general election too,"" Williams recalled. ""We wanted to make sure we were drawing independents to vote for us in the primary who would hopefully stick around for the general election.""

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News,"Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.

In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.

Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.

When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.

The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.

That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.

ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT

As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.

Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.

TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.

Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.

""We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,"" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. ""The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.""

The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.

The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.

Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.

""If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,"" Kim said.

Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.

""I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,"" she said. ""I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.""

She added: ""Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.""

REPUBLICAN HOPES

The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.

Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.

GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES

Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.

Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send ""ticked off"" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.

A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.

""We’ll come together,"" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. ""The threat from Republicans is too much.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.

The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a ""bump stock"" device is a ""machine gun"" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""

After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that ""bump stocks"" are machine guns.

The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.

GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several ""bump stocks"" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.

""It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,"" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.

But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.

The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.

""I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.""

Justice Samuel Alito called that ""disturbing.""

""These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.""

A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.

TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE

As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will ""bump"" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.

Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.

The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.

GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'

Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.

The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.

The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.

Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.

The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire ""automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""

Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.

""The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.""

After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, ""Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?""

But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.

""Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ""but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?""

The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.

""This is totally confusing,"" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.

""Now I'm completely lost,"" added Sotomayor at one point.

Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

""If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,"" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.

Supporters of the ban say it saves lives.

""Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,"" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. ""ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.""

A ruling is due by early summer.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The LAO laid out the grim forecast in a Tuesday report that cautions that a $24 billion ""erosion in revenues"" corresponds to a $15 billion increase in the state's budget problem. Due to this, the budget deficit, which last month was estimated to hit $58 billion, could now go as high as $73 billion.

""The actual increase in the state's budget problem will depend on a number of factors, including formula-driven spending changes, most notably Proposition 98 spending requirements for schools and community colleges,"" the report said.

H.D. Palmer, the deputy director of California's Department of Finance and Newsom's spokesperson on budget matters, responded to the new LAO report by telling Fox News Digital that their budget shortfall differs from the $38 billion they estimate.

""From now through April, more than $51 billion in income and corporate tax receipts are forecast to come in,"" Palmer said. ""No one can say today with certainty how those numbers may change the budget estimate of a $38 billion shortfall.""

""A responsible step would be for the Legislature to act now on the early action budget measures needed for $8 billion in solutions to help close this gap,"" he added.

California saw its first-ever population decline in 2020 when the state imposed rigid lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 2020 to July 2022, the state lost well over half a million people, with the number of residents leaving surpassing those moving in by almost 700,000.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said she was ""proud"" to cast a protest vote against President Biden in Michigan's Democratic primary on Tuesday.

Tlaib's comments were shared in a video by Listen To Michigan, a group dedicated to getting Democrats in the Great Lakes State to vote ""uncommitted"" in the primary election.

Biden's stance on Israel's war in Gaza has earned him fierce backlash from Arab American and Muslim community leaders, particularly in Michigan, which is home to one of the largest Muslim communities in the U.S.

""Hi everyone, it's Rashida. I was proud today to walk in and pull a Democratic ballot and vote uncommitted. We must protect our democracy, we must make sure that our government is about us, about the people,"" Tlaib said. ""When 74% of Democrats in Michigan support a ceasefire yet President Biden is not hearing us, this is the way we can use our democracy to say listen.""

TRUMP SAYS SOUTH CAROLINA IS 'BIGGER WIN THAN WE ANTICIPATED,' LOOKS FORWARD TO SAYING 'JOE, YOU'RE FIRED'

""Listen to the families right now that have been directly impacted, but also listen to majority of Americans that are saying enough. No more wars, no more using our dollars to fund a genocide. No more. So please, take your family members, use our democratic process to speak up about your core values, where you want to see our country go.""

Tlaib said it was the first time her 18-year-old son had voted in an election.

Progressive-led campaigns and lawmakers have hammered Biden's re-election campaign over the U.S.'s handling of the Middle East conflict.

In addition to Listen To Michigan, a group called Abandon Biden has been pushing voters to actively oppose the president for his failure to call for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza.

TRUMP 'REALLY NOT THINKING ABOUT' HALEY AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA VICTORY, SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON BEATING BIDEN

Abandon Biden is specifically targeting voters in swing states, which could prove critical in the 2024 race that is likely to pit Biden against his old political foe, former President Trump.

Tlaib has been among Biden's most vocal left-wing critics in Congress in the wake of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants launched a surprise invasion in southern Israel, killing over 1,000 people and taking dozens more hostage.

Israel has responded with heavy bombardment and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters, has said nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in the resulting conflict.

Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, has spent the last day urging Michiganders on social media to also protest Biden in the Democratic primary.

She wrote in one post on her Instagram Story, ""We attend marches and protests all the time! We can stand at a polling station for EVERY CHILD KILLED in Gaza. Don't stay home. Help the uncommitted campaign.""

Gun Owners Of America came out swinging against Senator John Cornyn, R-TX, after he entered the race to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Aidan Johnston, Gun Owners Of America’s (GOA) Federal Affairs Director, said tCornyn has failed to stand firm on conservative values and has instead, compromised with Democrats on gun control bills.

""Every time gun control gains steam in Congress, Senator John Cornyn is right there working with Democrats on a 'compromise.' That isn't conservative leadership, it's capitulation!,"" Johnston said.

CROWDED FIELD OF POTENTIAL MCCONNELL SUCCESSORS EMERGES IN SENATE

The GOA said that Sen. Cornyn's record on gun rights makes him ""wholly unfit"" to become the Senate minority leader.

""In the eyes of gun owners and all those who treasure our liberties, the traitor from Texas' record makes him wholly unfit to lead Republicans in the Senate,"" Johnston said.

The conservative gun rights group said Cornyn has helped pass a series of bills that are ""gross infringements"" on the Second Amendment.

The GOA pointed to Cornyn over the Safer Communities Act, which he cosponsored with Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy in 2022.

The bill incentivizes states to pass extreme risk protection laws, also called ""red flag"" laws, that allow members of the public and law enforcement to petition the courts for a civil order to temporarily suspend a person's access to firearms for fear that person might do violence.

MITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER

After gun rights advocates raised Second Amendment concerns, Congress included requirements that states applying for federal grants to implement red flag laws include certain due process protections.

""Sen. Cornyn is responsible for helping pass the so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that, among other things, bribes states to enact 'red-flag' gun confiscation laws, creates a national de facto wait period for young adults to buy a gun, and creates a backdoor ATF rule to eliminate the private sale of firearms,"" Johnston said. ""These are gross infringements on the Second Amendment.""

""The best thing Senator Cornyn could do for gun rights is join Mitch McConnell in retirement,"" he said.

Another conservative group, the National Association for Gun Rights, also came out against Cornyn's bid to replace McConnell.

""Cornyn is the most anti-gun Republican in Congress,"" said Dudley Brown, President of the National Association for Gun Rights. ""His sponsorship of ‘Fix NICS’ and proud role in passing the largest gun control bill in decades (Biden’s so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act) is repulsive to law-abiding gun owners.""



""When the most anti-gun President in history calls an anti-gun Republican ‘rational’ that should set off alarm bells in every law-abiding gun owners’ head,"" Brown added.

The gun groups' statements on Sen. Cornyn came after McConnell, 82, announced Wednesday that he plans to step away from leadership after becoming the longest-serving party leader in Senate history.

""I am asking my Republican colleagues to give me the opportunity to succeed Leader McConnell,"" said Cornyn, 72, in a statement released Thursday.

In the developing pool of potential successors, Cornyn is frequently mentioned as one of the ""three Johns"" likely to next lead the conference. The other two are Sens. John Thune, R-S.D. and John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Sen. Cornyn's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Former President Trump will win the Michigan Republican Primary Tuesday night, winning yet another early contest and additional delegates — bringing him one step closer to being able to formally secure the GOP nomination.

The Associated Press projected Trump will win the primary shortly after polls closed Tuesday night.

With the Michigan win, Trump has claimed victory in every primary and caucus of the 2024 GOP presidential primary cycle.

Trump, who will likely secure the GOP nomination by next week after the Super Tuesday primary contests, dominated the Iowa caucuses, left New Hampshire with a commanding victory, swept caucuses in Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, won South Carolina with a ""bigger win"" than he anticipated.

MICHIGAN PRIMARY PUTS MAJOR BATTLEGROUND STATE IN PLAY FOR 2024

Trump needs 1,215 delegates to formally secure the nomination.

Both Republican and Democratic voters in Michigan hit the polls Tuesday to cast their ballots in the state-run primaries.

Republican voters on Tuesday had their choice from Trump, the clear frontrunner, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — the only two GOP candidates in the race — and others who have since dropped out, including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

JAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER 'UNCOMMITTED' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: 'HUGE PROBLEM'

There are 16 delegates at stake.

Trump called into the Michigan GOP Watch Party Tuesday night shortly after the race was called in his favor.

""I just want to thank everybody. This was a great day,"" Trump said, pointing to the state's autoworkers, saying Democrats ""destroyed the autowork business,"" but vowed to ""bring it all back into Michigan"" if elected.

""I just want to thank everybody…the numbers are far greater than we even anticipated,"" he said, adding that he will ""be doing a lot of campaigning over the next couple of months.""

""I can tell you this November cannot come fast enough,"" Trump said. ""We have the worst president in history--the most incompetent and the most corrupt president, and we can't let this continue.""

""So that day, November 5th, and January 20th is when we take over,"" Trump said, referring to Election Day and Inauguration Day. ""We're going to make America great again, greater than ever before.""

Democratic voters also had their chance to vote in the primary, casting ballots for President Biden or his Democratic challengers, Rep. Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson. Those voters also had the option to cast an ""uncommitted"" vote.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

It is almost too early to truly understand and divine where the votes might for someone to succeed retiring Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

The reason? The universe and conditions under which Republican senators will vote next fall to pick their new leader haven’t formed yet. Yes, take a look at the three Johns: Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), former Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). Even someone like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) could be in play. A source tells FOX is interested in the race.

GOP WON’T TAP MCCONNELL'S SUCCESSOR UNTIL NOVEMBER

But beyond that, we don’t know much.

Here’s why:

We have to first know who wins the presidential election. And if 2024 is anything like 2020, we might not definitively know until week or more after the election. A delay in figuring out the winner could delay the internal secret leadership election which Senate Republicans will take in mid to late November. But the winner of the presidential election will dictate who the GOP wants – especially if former President Trump prevails and has much to say about it.

Ironically, FOX is told that the antipathy between the former President and McConnell was not a major factor in the decision-making of the Kentucky Republican to step down.

MITCH MCCONNELL SENDS 'SHOCKWAVES' THROUGH SENATE WITH SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT

Another factor: who has control of the Senate – and by how many seats. Keep in mind we didn’t know until January 2021 as to which party would control the Senate in the last Congress.

This is why other figures may emerge. Especially dark horses.

As I have written before, leadership elections in Congress are not ""partisan politics"" They are ""particle politics."" The person who is propelled into leadership is not always the obvious choice: Think former House Speakers John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Or even current House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

WHY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS' IMPEACHMENT TRIAL MAY BE ON 'HIATUS'

FOX is told that some Senate Republicans are tired of what one senior Senate GOP leadership source termed a ""weekly MAGA show"" by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), JD Vance (R-Ohio) and others at the weekly Senate Republican Conference meetings. So if former President Trump loses and if the GOP doesn’t have control of the Senate, that could dictate who Republicans pick.

However, if Republicans prevail with a substantial majority, look at Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) as a possibility. He leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP’s campaign arm. Daines has made many of the right moves so far in GOP contests. If Republicans win the Senate by a good margin, some members (especially the new ones), might be willing to give Daines a look – if he’s interested.

The same factor could undercut Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). It’s not clear if Scott is interested. He ran unsuccessfully against McConnell in the fall of 2022. Scott led the GOP’s campaign efforts in 2022 – and Republicans failed to win the Senate. That could be an albatross for Scott and potentially inhibit him from making another run at leadership.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A top House Republican lawmaker is changing his mind about retirement after urging from former President Donald Trump.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., said on Thursday that he is reversing course on his decision to not run for a fourth term.

""While my strong desire was to leave Congress at the end of this year, since my announcement, I have received countless calls from constituents, colleagues, and President Trump urging me to reconsider,"" Green said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""I will be running for re-election so I can be here on Day 1 next year to help President Trump end this border crisis once and for all.""

TRUMP WINS THE MICHIGAN GOP PRIMARY, BRINGING HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO SECURING REPUBLICAN NOMINATION

His announcement came shortly after Trump urged Green to reconsider in a post on his Truth Social account. The former president said he would endorse Green if he ran.

""Mark Green has had lots of options because of his political talents, and the great job he has done as a Congressman, but given the fantastic work he’s doing as Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I hope he runs for Re-Election to the U.S. House of Representatives. If he does, he has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"" Trump wrote.

In addition to running for his own re-election, Trump is throwing his influence into House and Senate races across the country with various endorsements and behind-the-scenes maneuvering.

TRUMP HOLDS LARGE DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD OVER HALEY AHEAD OF CRUCIAL SHOWDOWN

He met recently with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ campaign arm.

Their sit-down at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, earlier this month primarily involved discussions about the 2024 election cycle and how to keep and expand Johnson’s razor-thin two-seat House majority.

As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Green has played a leading role in the House’s impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

He told Fox News Digital last week that his role has been ""challenging, rewarding and meaningful.""

EXCLUSIVE: A New York City police officer who was attacked by migrants in Times Square is coming to Washington, D.C., to watch President Biden tout his administration’s work over the last year in his State of the Union address.

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only Republican representing New York City in the House, told Fox News Digital she invited NYPD Lieutenant Ben Kurian to the president’s major address on Wednesday.

""Our NYPD officers are on the front line every single day working to keep our streets safe, and unfortunately, now they are being forced to deal with hundreds of violent crimes being committed by those in our country illegally,"" Malliotakis said.

ICE OFFICIAL RIPS NYC POLICIES SHIELDING POLICE-BEATING MIGRANTS FROM DEPORTATION

""The horrifying video of Lt. Kurian and his fellow officer being attacked by a mob in Times Square was hard to watch, but it shed a light on just how difficult our officers’ jobs have become.""

She said his presence at Biden’s speech will ""bring attention to the need for the Biden administration to end its dangerous border policies.""

A now-viral video from late January showed two officers being attacked by a group of migrants in the heart of New York City’s tourist area.

NYPD CHIEF BLASTS MIGRANTS' ATTACK ON OFFICERS AS MUGSHOTS OF SUSPECTS RELEASED

One suspect can be seen kicking an officer in the head twice while another person kicked the other officer in the back.

The attack began after the police officers asked migrants who were blocking the sidewalk outside a shelter to disperse, the NYPD has said.

The incident was a flashpoint in the tension that’s long been simmering in New York City since it was flooded by thousands of migrants, many seeking asylum. A number were bussed up by Southern governors whose states were buckling under the strain of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

More than 161,000 migrants have come to New York City in need of shelter and other city resources since the middle of 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said.

AMERICANS AREN’T SAFE WITH BIDEN'S OPEN BORDER AND THE SYSTEM IS ‘FLASHING RED’

Earlier this week, Adams, a Democrat, called for curtailing the city’s ""sanctuary"" status to allow migrants ""suspected of serious crimes"" to be turned over to federal law enforcement.

Republican lawmakers, including Malliotakis, have denounced the city’s sanctuary policies as a primary driver of the migrant crisis.

When reached for comment on Malliotakis' speech invitation, the White House referred Fox News Digital to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre's earlier condemnation of the attack.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.

Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.

Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.

Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.

The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.

The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was ""no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.""

Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.

Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.

Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.

""I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,"" Austin said at the time. ""I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden said Monday a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is close and hoped to see one materialize by ""the end of the weekend.""

The seemingly casual comments, carrying massive geopolitical significance, came during the president’s stop at an ice cream parlor near Peacock Network’s headquarters, where he had just wrapped up an interview with Seth Meyers on the ""Late Night"" show.

Asked by a reporter when he expected the ceasefire to begin, Biden, with a mint ice cream cone in hand, said he hoped by at least ""the end of the weekend.""

""At least, my national security advisor tells me that we’re close. We’re close. It’s not done yet,"" Biden said. ""And my hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a ceasefire.""

Biden also spoke about his planned trip to the southern border this Thursday where he will meet with border agents and discuss the need for bipartisan legislation.

Biden joked that ""my good friend"" would be making a border stop as well, a subtle nod to GOP rival, former President Trump, who is traveling to the border as well.

Biden's visit comes after the murder of Augusta University student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus in Athens last week allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant. Her murder has reinvigorated calls for Biden to take more stringent border measures.

The stop in Van Leeuwen came after a taped interview with Meyers, where dozens of pro-Palestinian activists were arrested for demonstrating in the lobby.

Negotiations are underway for a weekslong cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to allow for the release of hostages being held in Gaza by the Iranian-backed terrorist group in return for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The proposed six-week pause in fighting would also include allowing hundreds of trucks to deliver desperately needed aid into Gaza every day.

FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans have introduced legislation that would allow states to secure the border by constructing temporary border barriers along the southern and northern borders to stop the entry of illegal immigrants.

Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., is introducing the CONTAINER Act in the House – a bill that aims to give states the authority to build temporary barriers on federal land in an effort to stop illegal immigrants and drugs like fentanyl from entering into their states via the U.S.-Mexico border.

The bill is in response to legal battles that hit both Arizona and Texas over their efforts to secure the border with new barriers after border wall construction largely stopped when President Donald Trump left office.

BIDEN, DURING VISIT TO OVERWHELMED BORDER, URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK SENATE BILL: ‘TIME TO ACT'

In 2022, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, set up hundreds of double-stacked shipping containers across the border in an effort to stop illegal immigrants as numbers rose in his state. In 2023, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott installed wrecking-ball-sized buoys and razor wire along the Rio Grande as part of his Operation Lone Star.

Arizona’s barrier has since been removed. In December, a judge ordered Texas to remove its buoys in the Rio Grande, and a court battle between Texas and the Biden administration is ongoing after Texas sued the federal government for cutting the wire.

""Not only has the Biden Administration failed to enforce our laws and secure our border, but they have also barred border states from executing more robust border security measures,"" Rouzer said in a statement. ""No community is immune to the drugs, sex trafficking and crime these policies are incentivizing while enriching the cartels. This bill will give border states the explicit ability to erect physical barriers to protect not only their citizens, but all of America, from President Biden’s catastrophic open-border policies.""

Co-sponsors on the bill include House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R–Texas, and Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas.

""States like my home in Texas have the right to secure their borders when the White House refuses to do so,"" Pfluger said.

Companion legislation was previously introduced in the Senate by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who said last month that ""it’s clear Congress must act to give border states the explicit authority to protect their communities and the sovereignty of the United States.""

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Republicans have repeatedly called for border barrier construction as one of the ways to help secure the southern border. The House Republican border legislation, which passed the chamber last year, would restart border wall construction. However, it has not yet been taken up in the upper chamber.

The Biden administration has largely ended border wall construction, calling it ineffective. Some construction has continued where money has already been appropriated by Congress in previous fiscal years. It has also called for Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate border bill that does include some funding for border wall construction. But conservatives have warned that the legislation would normalize already-high levels of illegal immigration.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter Monday ahead of the government funding deadline later this week urging Republicans to reauthorize the federal radiation compensation policy.

The policy, known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), is on track to expire this spring. It was originally enacted in 1990 to compensate Americans exposed to radiation during the Manhattan Project and Cold War testing. While RECA has compensated many, there are still people awaiting claims, and certain affected groups have been overlooked, Hawley said.

""It is our duty to reauthorize and update RECA this spring. I emphasize that this is not a welfare program. It is a matter of basic justice for those the government poisoned,"" Hawley wrote in the letter. ""We’ve developed the most advanced nuclear weapons on earth, but we cannot forget the working people of this country who were sacrificed for it.""

BIDEN CALLS JOHNSON, SCHUMER FOR WHITE HOUSE MEETING AMID CONGRESSIONAL CHAOS STIRRING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FEARS

Hawley, a skeptic of additional funding to Ukraine, added, ""If we can send hundreds of billions of dollars in security assistance to foreign nations, we can spend a fraction of that on our own constituents who deserve help.""

Studies show that radiation from decades of mining, processing and enriching continues to permeate sites used during World War II and the Cold War.

In the 1940s, the U.S. was ramping up its military production to prepare for WWII, which included the government converting farmlands in Weldon Springs, Mo. into the Weldon Spring Chemical Plant. The plant produced a massive amount of TNT and DNT explosives for the war effort.

For Hawley, the issue hits close to home. In his home state of Missouri, nuclear waste was reportedly mishandled at one processing site, with leaky barrels left in the open air and contaminating a nearby creek where children have played for years. Hawley says in the letter many of those children have since developed cancer.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

""Tens of thousands of other Americans were exposed to radiation 'downwind' from over 100 atmospheric tests in western States,"" Hawley wrote. ""In most cases, nobody was warned of this danger. In others, the government simply lied. Repeatedly.""

But this could slow up the legislative process to approve government funding at the end of the week, as the upper chamber scrambles to pass full-year appropriations bills that would fund several federal agencies. The current temporary spending patch, known as a Continuing Resolution (CR), expires Friday and Congress will have to pass legislation by then to avert a partial government shutdown. The Senate has not introduced spending agreements yet for the remaining nine bills.

Hawley’s office told Fox News Digital it will seek to attach the RECA reauthorization to any legislative proposal that is likely to get signed into law.

This isn't the first time Hawley has tried to increase RECA's reauthorization chances by attaching it to any legislative vehicle that has a chance of passing. Last year, the Senate initially amended the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to include Hawley's RECA amendment, but it was later removed right before the package passed. Hawley's office has speculated it was removed due to cost.

Last year, some Republicans opposed a similar bill by Hawley that included RECA, arguing it would cost $100 billion over the course of a decade. Hawley proceeded to revise that portion of the bill and slashed the multi-billion dollar price tag, but his colleagues were still not convinced.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has opposed the proposal to reauthorize RECA, citing a commitment to shrink the federal deficit.

The Border Patrol union issued a fiery warning on Thursday to President Biden, telling him to ""keep our name out of your mouth,"" hours before the president is due to meet with officials at the border and urge passage of a Senate border bill.

Biden and former President Donald Trump are both heading to the border, with Biden visiting Brownsville, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders.

""During his trip, the President will receive a briefing on border security operations and an operational briefing from CBP, ICE, and USCIS. Afterwards, the President will deliver remarks to emphasize the need for Congressional Republicans to stop putting politics ahead of our border security and pass the bipartisan border security agreement,"" a White House official said.

BORDER PATROL UNION SLAMS BIDEN BORDER VISIT AS ‘TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE’ JUST TO ‘TRY TO SAVE HIMSELF’

That bipartisan bill, which includes additional staffing for Border Patrol and other agencies, as well as funding for cities and states receiving migrants and limits on asylum, won the backing of the union. Conservative lawmakers, however, rejected the bill and said it would normalize unacceptably high levels of illegal immigration and the bill has not progressed.

While it backed the bipartisan bill that Biden also supports, the National Border Patrol Council has otherwise been intensely critical of the Biden administration’s handling of the border crisis and put that in no uncertain terms in a post on X.

""Attention President Biden: Keep our name out of your mouth today,"" it said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on the post.

The union had issued a statement this week, calling the visit ""too little, too late.""

DUELING BIDEN, TRUMP VISITS TO BESIEGED BORDER COME AMID FRESH SLEW OF VIOLENT CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""But even if he were to put the proper policies in place at this late hour, he’d be doing it only to try to save his Presidency. And self-serving actions when time is winding down should always give Americans pause. Common sense dictates that as a lame duck, he’d revert to his open border policies if re-elected,"" the union said.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

""Biden is going to the border now solely to try to save himself. Border security should never be about politics, it should always be about the safety and security of this great nation and the American people,"" it said.

The trip comes as illegal immigration has become a top election issue, with polls showing a majority of voters see it as a critical threat to the country.

President Biden will seek to put the ball in the Republicans’ camp, repeating the administration’s argument that it is working within a ""broken"" system that needs funding and reforms from Congress. The White House has also pointed to a record of over 550,000 removals since May last year, more than any year since FY 23.

What's Happening?

- Fani Willis' disqualification hearing happening Friday afternoon…

- DC voters make their presidential primary pick…

- Harris' shrinking role in migrant crisis

Where was the VP?

President Biden visited the southern border in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday, and was joined by a number of top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but Vice President Kamala Harris was not among them.

Biden spoke in Brownsville after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He urged Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that he believes will help solve the raging crisis at the southern border.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

But the vice president, who was tasked in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration, was not there.

A year ago, Harris announced an additional $950 million in response to the Call to Action, bringing in a total of more than $4.2 billion since May 2021. But since then, her public role only appears to have continually shrunk, even amid a historic year for illegal immigration, with more than 2.4 million migrant encounters in FY 23. FY 24 has been similarly overwhelming, with over 300,000 encounters in December.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

Biden spoke in Brownsville, Texas, after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He began by addressing recent wildfires in Texas and Oklahoma, and linking them to climate change.

BORDER PATROL UNION TELLS BIDEN TO ‘KEEP OUR NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH’ AHEAD OF TEXAS VISIT

The visit, which coincided with former President Donald Trump's visit to the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, comes as illegal immigration has become a major 2024 election issue and remains a thorny issue for the administration. Polls show that more than half of Americans think large numbers of illegal immigrants entering the U.S. represents a critical threat to the country.

The crisis, now into its third year, has smashed multiple records with more than 2.4 million encounters in FY 23 and over 300,000 in December alone — breaking the record for monthly encounters.

President Biden and his administration have sought to shift the blame for the crisis onto the shoulders of Republicans. The administration says that it is working with a broken system that needs significantly more funding and comprehensive immigration reform. It introduced a bill on Biden's first day in office that included a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants already in the U.S., which was immediately rejected by Republicans.

Republicans in the House introduced and passed legislation of their own that would fund more Border Patrol agents, resume wall construction, restart the Remain-in-Mexico policy and severely limit the ability of migrants to claim asylum.

After the White House made a supplemental funding request, including $20 billion for border funding in late 2023, Senate negotiators hashed out a deal that included additional staffing at the border and in asylum offices, an increased $1.4 billion in funding to cities and NGOs receiving migrants, took action to tackle fentanyl smuggling and would limit asylum claims. It would also increase detention beds to 50,000 and provide additional immigration judges.

DUELING BIDEN, TRUMP VISITS TO BESIEGED BORDER COME AMID FRESH SLEW OF VIOLENT CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""Folks, the bipartisan border security bill is a win for the American people and a win for the people of Texas, and it's fair for those who legitimately have a right to come here,"" Biden said.

""The U.S. Senate need to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits, not on whether it's going to benefit one party or another party,"" he said, also calling for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to put it on the floor in the House.

However, it has failed to gain enough support in the Senate, as conservative lawmakers have warned that a limiting mechanism that only comes into place after an average of 5,000 encounters a day would normalize already-high levels of illegal immigration.

Biden said, however, that it was ""the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.""

He also appealed to his predecessor to back the bill.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

""I understand my predecessor is in Eagle Pass today — here’s what I would say to Mr. Trump,"" Biden said. ""Join me, or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together.""

Republicans in the House, who have recently impeached DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, say Biden doesn’t need additional congressional action to secure the border and can do so with the tools his administration already has.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Speaking to Fox News Digital ahead of the speech, GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., dismissed Biden’s trip as a photo op, and called it ""another sign of Biden’s incompetence.""

""It's just going to be another cleaned up photo op. It's not going to be any actual confrontation of the crisis that this guy created. Time and time again, Joe Biden proves that he cares more about minimizing the political implications of this issue than actually addressing it. So I don't expect much is going to come out of it, except the American people are going to realize once again that Joe Biden doesn't really mean business when it comes to the border,"" he said.

Emmer said that to solve the crisis, Biden needs to tackle the five issues that were in the House GOP bill: end catch and release, reform parole authority, finish the wall, reform asylum and restore Remain-in-Mexico, which kept migrants in Mexico for the duration of their hearings.

Emmer, like others in the House GOP caucus, was dismissive of the contents of the Senate bill that Biden is promoting.

""You're going to make it law now that he can let in up to 5,000 a day before it becomes a shutdown situation? Outrageous. And the fact that anybody even reports it as an option, I think is less than responsible,"" he said. ""You’ve got to do something in the five areas that the House has already addressed, but the bare minimum is to restore Remain in Mexico.""

In the Senate, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., called the speech a ""half-hearted attempt to pay lip service to the crisis his policies have caused.""

""President Biden can fix this crisis, and I hope his visit is the wakeup call he needs to use the authority he already has to build the border wall, reinstate Title 42, and end catch-and-release, so that we can finally secure our border, uphold our national security, and keep Americans safe,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on President Biden to debate former President Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner, arguing that the president could ""beat"" Trump like he did in 2020.

""Biden beat Trump in the prior debates. I look forward to it,"" the California Democrat said during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.

The comment comes as Biden has so far refused to commit to debate Trump, who has a commanding lead in the Republican presidential primary race. Trump, on the other hand, has called on the president to debate him ""immediately,"" arguing such an event would be ""for the good of the country.""

'THE VIEW' HOSTS CLASH OVER WHETHER BIDEN SHOULD DEBATE TRUMP, WORRY PRESIDENT 'CAN LOSE'

Trump's desire to debate Biden comes despite his refusal to appear for debates against GOP primary foes, something Newsom argued Sunday was ""weakness masquerading as strength.""

""This is... pure projection on a guy who refused to debate in his own primary,"" Newsom said.

But not everyone believes Biden has much to gain by debating Trump ahead of this year's election, with the topic recently becoming the subject of a heated debate between the co-hosts of ""The View"" earlier this week.

BIDEN IS LYING LOW AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL AS COMMENTATORS WORRY THAT HE IS SEEN AS ‘NOT IN CONTROL’ OF THE NATION

Co-host Sara Haines had particularly strong feelings on the topic, warning that only Trump would benefit from the two candidates squaring off.

""Biden can lose, he can lose in a debate,"" Haines said. ""Trump will not. The people supporting Trump will support him whether he’s there or not. Biden makes one mistake, and the people who are undecided are out.""

Newsom's comments also come as speculation about his desire to jump into the race have continued to swirl, something the California governor said Sunday was off the table.

""I am here celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration,"" Newsom said, calling the continued speculation about his potential run ""idle chat"" and a ""sideshow.""

""It's not even an interesting conversation,"" Newsom continued. ""I think it's a damning conversation, frankly, the other side wants us to have… they love ginning this stuff up.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Minnesota's budget outlook has improved, officials said Thursday, with a slightly bigger surplus forecast for the current budget that will give the Legislature a little more breathing room this session.

Minnesota Management and Budget said the current two-year budget period, which runs through June 2025, is now expected to end with a surplus of just over $3.7 billion.

""The near-term economic outlook has improved, with growth expected to persist through 2027,"" the budget office said, citing higher tax collections. Corporate tax revenues are showing the largest gains due to higher-than-expected corporate profits.

The budget office is also forecasting a smaller potential deficit for the next two-year budget, which begins in July 2025.

Among those who are being floated as a potential replacement for the leadership position are senators John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; Rick Scott R-Fla.; Tom Cotton, R-Ark.; and Steve Daines, R-Mont.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced in a floor speech Wednesday he will step down from leadership in November. The Kentucky Republican is the Senate's longest-serving party leader in history.

Speculation about Thune, Barrasso or Daines taking over as leader stems from their current roles in GOP leadership. They serve as Republican whip, Senate Republican Conference chairman and National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, respectively.

MITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER

""Chairman Daines is laser-focused on taking back the Senate majority,"" NRSC communications director Mike Berg told Fox News Digital.

One source familiar with Senate Republican conference discussions shared that the ""three Johns"" — Thune, Cornyn and Barrasso — are not of the same political stripe. Barrasso is considered the most conservative out of the three, the source said. Barrasso is also believed to be a more palatable option for the various factions of Republicans in the Senate who don't always see eye to eye. He notably endorsed former President Trump early last month.

SEN. COTTON PROBES DOD HOW US AIRMAN WHO LIT HIMSELF ON FIRE WAS 'ALLOWED TO SERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY'

""What I'm focused on is the election,"" Barrasso told reporters shortly after McConnell's announcement.

As for decisions regarding leadership, he said, ""I'm going to talk to members of the conference, hear what they have to say, listen to them in terms of what direction that they want to take with us.""

Both Cornyn and Thune also endorsed Trump after Barrasso. Thune had initially endorsed fellow Sen. Tim Scott R-S.C., who ultimately dropped out and endorsed Trump.

Sen. Rick Scott was more pointed in his statement following McConnell's surprise announcement, saying in a statement, ""I have been very clear and have long believed that we need new leadership in the Senate that represents our voters and the issues we were sent here to fight for.""

When Scott challenged McConnell for the position, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told reporters McConnell received 37 votes from conference members, while Scott received 10. One Republican voted ""present."" Some of those who reportedly voted against McConnell were senators Josh Hawley, R-Mo; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Braun; Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who supported Scott in 2022, would welcome Scott's leadership if he were to take over, a staffer in Lee's office told Fox News Digital.

MCCONNELL SAYS SENATE TRIAL FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT IS THE 'BEST WAY FORWARD'

The source also shared that Cotton was being mentioned as a potential contender for the position. Cotton's office couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Cornyn, who does not hold a leadership position in the GOP and is poised to launch a potential bid for leader, said in a statement Wednesday that ""today is about Mitch McConnell.""

""But I've made no secret about my intentions,"" he added.

Cornyn on his timeline: ""Not today.""

Cornyn also endorsed former President Trump to be the Republican presidential nominee, and some lawmakers have begun looking to the likely GOP candidate for guidance about who should replace McConnell.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told reporters Wednesday the next person ""absolutely"" needs to have a more positive relationship with Trump, adding, ""He's going to be the next president, we have to work together.""

Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., agreed.

""It's so important that the next leader have a very positive relationship with the president,"" Marshall told Fox News Digital in an interview Wednesday. ""I think that this next leader needs to have a little bit more, maybe a lot more of a populist view.""

Marshall, who positioned himself alongside conservative hardliners who were critical of McConnell and voted against the bipartisan border deal in the national security supplemental package this month, added that the names being floated for leadership have been ""interviewing for the job since I got here.""

""I watch how they vote. I watch what their priorities are. I've been watching their volume on what issues they're championing,"" he said. ""All the names … have great qualities.

AFP Action, the conservative wing of the powerful and influential conservative Americans for Prosperity, funded by the billionaire Koch Brothers, has pulled funding for the presidential campaign of Nikki Haley.

In an email to staffers obtained by Fox News, AFP Action senior adviser Emily Seidel said the group did not believe that ""any outside group can make a material difference to widen [Haley’s] path to victory.""

""And so while we will continue to endorse her, we will focus our resources where we can make the difference. And that’s the U.S. Senate and House,"" Seidel wrote.

The news was first reported by Politico earlier Sunday.

AFP Action endorsed Haley in November, giving her a major grassroots and organizational boost.

The deep-pocketed fiscally conservative network launched an ad blitz on behalf of Haley in January, including mailers, digital ads, and connected TV spots.

AFP Action, which pledged to spend tens of millions of dollars to help push the Republican Party past former President Trump as it endorsed Haley in late November, said last month it was putting an initial $27 million behind this new wave in their ongoing campaign.

TOP HIGHLIGHTS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA'S GOP PRIMARY WHERE TRUMP WON BIG, HALEY VOWED TO PRESS ON

The news came after Haley’s GOP rival, former President Trump, won the GOP primary in Haley’s home state of South Carolina on Saturday.

Despite the loss, and defying calls to exit the race, Haley has said it’s not the ""end of our story"" as she traveled Sunday to Michigan ahead of the state’s primary on Tuesday.

In the less than 24 hours following her Saturday night loss, Haley's campaign said that she had raised $1 million ""from grassroots supporters alone,"" Fox News previously reported.

EUROPEAN NATIONS HAVE TO START PAYING UP: DONALD TRUMP

Haley's campaign argued that the money raised ""demonstrates Haley's staying power and her appeal to broad swaths of the American public.""

Asked Sunday about losing funding from AFP Action, Haley said she was ""not worried.""

""Americans for Prosperity was an amazing partner. They strongly believe in freedom. They believe in limited government. They believe in all the things that I, as a conservative, believe. And they've been fantastic through these states,"" Haley said, vowing to continue fighting ""for the 70% of Americans that don't want to see a Trump-Biden rematch.""

With his win Saturday in the first-in-the South contest, Trump has now swept every primary or caucus on the GOP early-season calendar that awards delegates. His performances have left little maneuvering room for Haley, his former U.N. ambassador.

The Border Patrol union mocked President Biden on Saturday for his trip to the Texas border this week.

""Board AF1, take nap. Wake up in place called Brownsville,"" the union wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in a joke itinerary of his day, along with a photo of Biden resting in a beach lounge chair. ""Read large teleprompter message, ‘It's all Trump's fault.’ Board AF1, ask who people in green uniforms were, told they ‘strap’ illegal aliens, express horror, take nap. Wake up, call a lid, hit beach, take nap.""

While in Brownsville on Thursday, Biden lamented that the bipartisan immigration bill failed to pass in the Senate, blaming Trump for using it as a political issue. Many Republicans have expressed their opposition to the bill, which they say doesn't do enough.

""The majority of Democrats and Republicans in both houses support this legislation,"" Biden said in Brownsville, ""until someone came along and said don't do that that'll benefit the incumbent. That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.""

WATCH: BORDER PATROL UNION CHIEF EXPLODES ON BIDEN IN FIERY PRESS CONFERENCE, SAYS AGENTS ‘P----D’ AT POLICIES

The president faces increasing scrutiny over his handling of the border as the Border Patrol continues to report a record number of migrant encounters.

In December alone, there were more than 300,000 encounters – an all-time record.

The issue also threatens to hurt Biden politically ahead of November’s presidential election.

Trump was also at the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday which he said is ""being overrun by the Biden migrant crime,"" invoking the murder of Georgia student Laken Riley allegedly by a Venezuelan migrant last week.

BIDEN, TRUMP MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" Trump said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Biden and his administration have sought to shift the blame for the crisis onto the shoulders of Republicans. The administration says that it is working with a broken system that needs significantly more funding and comprehensive immigration reform. It introduced a bill on Biden's first day in office that included a mass amnesty for millions of migrants already in the U.S., which was immediately rejected by Republicans.

Republicans in the House introduced and passed legislation of their own that would fund more Border Patrol agents, resume wall construction, restart the Remain-in-Mexico policy and severely limit the ability of migrants to claim asylum.

The Border Patrol union frequently mocks the president over illegal immigration.

The organization wrote in part on X on Friday, ""Wasn't it Biden who encouraged people from all over the world to ‘surge the border’? Didn't Biden immediately void all the successful Trump EO's that were keeping our border under control? Didn't he publicly and viciously accuse BP agents of criminal assault, then told the world ‘those people will pay’, and the entire thing was made up BS? Has he apologized or taken responsibility for any of it, or asked forgiveness from the victims of some of the millions of illegal aliens he imported into this country?""

And before Biden went to the border, the group posted, ""Attention President Biden: Keep our name out of your mouth today.""

The murder of a Georgia nursing student allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested in New York City is the ""direct result"" of recent New York City laws that severed ties between the NYPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Republican Councilman Joe Borelli argued.

""It is a direct result of the City Council passing legislation that limits cooperation. If those laws were not enacted, the Department of Corrections would have given ICE the opportunity to issue a detainer against Jose Ibarra,"" Borelli told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week.

Georgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 22, was discovered beaten to death earlier this month after going for a run on the University of Georgia’s campus. The Augusta University student crossed paths with illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra, according to authorities, and died from blunt force trauma to the head.

Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was granted border ""parole,"" which allows noncitizens to temporarily enter the country due to an emergency or humanitarian reason, authorities have said. Ibarra soon made his way up to New York City, where he was arrested in August and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,"" according to ICE.

7.2M ILLEGALS ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

The NYPD, however, has said it does not have a record of Ibarra's arrest.

Typically, when ICE learns an illegal immigrant is arrested on criminal charges, the agency will issue a detainer that requests the local police department hold the suspect until ICE can take over and begin deportation proceedings.

In Ibarra’s case, ICE said he was released by the NYPD before a detainer could be issued.

New York City, however, is a ""sanctuary city"" with relatively recent laws passed by City Council severing many ties between the NYPD and ICE.

""A woman is dead in Georgia because the New York City Council passed local laws barring the NYPD from cooperating with ICE, and as such the suspect was released without any notification to federal law enforcement,"" Borelli tweeted this week, accompanied by a list of laws that restricted local cooperation with the immigration agency.

Under a pair of 2014 laws, the local Department of Corrections and NYPD were restricted from complying with ICE detainers under certain conditions. The DOC, for example, is only allowed to comply with an ICE detainer if it is accompanied by a warrant from a federal judge and if the suspect has been convicted of a violent crime in the last five years.

""Our city is not served when New Yorkers with strong ties in the community are afraid to engage with law enforcement because they fear deportation. Today, we send another message to Washington that the time to act has come to provide relief to so many individuals who contribute to our nation’s growth,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said when the two laws were enacted.

""I’d like to thank Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the City Council for passing this legislation, which further establishes New York City as a leader in immigration reform.""

Similar reforms continued under the de Blasio administration, including in 2017, when the City Council passed a bill prohibiting ""City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law.""

""The de Blasio Administration today announced the issuance of citywide guidance and new NYPD protocols to clarify and institutionalize the City’s policy that it will not voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities, and will only coordinate in limited circumstances, including where there is a public safety risk,"" a press release from the de Blasio administration stated of the law at the start of 2018.

Borelli, who has served on City Council representing portions of Staten Island since 2015, argued ""it's interesting to see people trying to backtrack on the impact that these laws have on the cooperation between ICE and city law enforcement.""

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""But the proof is in the pudding,"" he said.

The New York Republican pointed to comments made by local politicians when the laws were passed, arguing that Democrats wanted to sever communication between local law enforcement and federal authorities when involving illegal immigrants.

""The day we start helping ICE is the day we lose the public trust, which is why this guidance and protocol is so critical,"" a former NYC council member said in 2018, when de Blasio announced the prohibition of city agencies partnering with the Department of Homeland Security when related to immigration laws.

Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams also supported the measure in 2018, when he served as Brooklyn borough president.

""It is important for our police officers and City employees to have clear guidance and protocol on how to interact with federal immigration enforcement, especially considering the overaggressive behavior of ICE agents. Public safety for all of our residents must come first,"" Adams said, according to the de Blasio-era press release.

Following Laken Riley’s murder, Adams said this week that he supports altering city laws that would open the doors to New York City officials working with federal authorities on immigration matters involving violent suspects or repeat offenders.

""I want to go back to the standards of the previous mayors who I believe subscribed to my belief that people who are suspected of committing serious crimes in this city should be held accountable,"" Adams told reporters at City Hall Tuesday.

""We should not be allowing people who are repeatedly committing crimes to remain here, and we cannot collaborate with ICE in the process,"" the mayor added.

Adams has repeatedly spoken out in support of keeping New York City as a sanctuary city, saying illegal immigrants in the Big Apple should not live in fear of receiving city services, such as attending a school, due to their immigration status.

When asked about Borelli's comments and the laws passed by City Council under his administration, de Blasio told Fox News Digital in a statement that it's time for ""tougher border policies.""

""I trust the NYPD, and they say they never encountered the accused individual. But it’s sickening that a young, promising life was cut short. Any way you slice it, we need tougher border policies and comprehensive immigration reform,"" de Blasio said.

The former mayor also pointed Fox Digital to an opinion piece he wrote this month, in which he proposed accepting ""Republican demands for greater border security in exchange for full funding of a humane and functioning asylum process,"" along with ""spending billions to create the facilities necessary on the Mexican side of the border, including the concessions and incentives the Mexican government would require in order to accept this plan.""

Borelli argued the push by the City Council to sever ties with federal authorities back when de Blasio was in office evolved from Democrats in the city wanting to resist what they saw as a ""Trump agenda"" on immigration.

""This was a reaction by the de Blasio administration and the City Council to push back on what they saw as the Trump agenda. And as long as they were doing what they could to oppose Trump, they didn't care,"" he said.

Borelli said the local legislation is now backfiring as New Yorkers and others question the laws’ logic.

""It's completely backfired when people start to question, ‘What is the logic of having people who are here illegally in the first place, and then commit crimes against New Yorkers and others?’ There's limited rationale for keeping them here, even if you were a progressive who is sympathetic to people coming here in the first place,"" Borelli said.

Laken Riley’s murder has shocked many Americans and heightened outrage about the Biden administration’s border policies. More than 7 million illegal immigrants have flooded the nation since President Biden took office in 2021, a figure larger than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News Digital analysis previously found.

Riley was reportedly so badly beaten during the murder that her skull was disfigured, investigators reported in an affidavit.

""He’s a sick puppy,"" Borelli told Fox Digital when asked about the brutal attack. ""[He] would not have withstood screening, we hope, if we had a proper system of vetting and deporting people.""

Ibarra is in custody and was charged with the felonies of malice murder, murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and concealing the death of another, as well as the misdemeanor of physically hindering a 911 call, according to the affidavit filed Feb. 23.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER: MEDIA OUTLETS FOCUS ON LONE JOGGERS, DOWNPLAY SUSPECTED KILLER’S IMMIGRATION STATUS

New York State Senate Republicans on Wednesday announced the renaming of legislation that would allow local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE. The legislation will now be known as ""Laken's Law"" in memory of Riley.

""Because of New York law, because of New York sanctuary state laws, local law enforcement do not notify federal immigration officials when they take someone into custody, even if they're here — especially when they're here illegally,"" Republican New York state Sen. Robert Ortt said at a press conference Wednesday.

""So, Laken Riley's murderer, albeit an alleged murderer, was in custody, law enforcement custody, and he was released without notification to ICE, to federal authorities, because of policies and laws passed by Democrats here in New York State,""

Montgomery County officials met with ICE’s Baltimore Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to discuss cooperation on Tuesday. In a statement, county officials said there was a ""productive discussion"" between County Executive Marc Elrich and Baltimore Field Office Director Darius Reeves ""about improved communications and operational challenges with custody transfers."" An ICE official told Fox News Digital that a dialogue had been opened on honoring detainers and they were looking forward to a mutually beneficial arrangement.

ICE lodges detainers against illegal immigrants who are brought into local police custody when ICE believes them to be deportable. Those detainers request that the police notify ICE when they are about to be released and sometimes hold them for a limited additional time so that ICE can take them safely into federal custody and act to remove them.

However, ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions refuse to honor such detainers. Montgomery County claims it is not a sanctuary county, and that it works with ICE in their work on ""immigration and customs violations and drug and human trafficking."" Elrich said on a press call on Wednesday that the county does honor some detainers when an illegal immigrant is convicted of violent crimes.

Despite that claim, ICE says no detainers have been honored in the county in either the last fiscal year or this one. Director Reeves told Fox News Digital this week that in FY 2023, ICE issued 198 detainers, none of which were honored. So far in FY 2024, the agency has issued 119 detainers and none have been honored by the county.

He said those included illegal immigrants with convictions for assault, robbery, illegal firearm possession, sex abuse of a minor, rape and other sex offenses. He also said there was at least one MS-13 gang member among those whom ICE had requested, but they had been rebuffed by the county.

In the state of Maryland as a whole, the agency arrested 152 sex offenders in FY23. He said the counties that do not honor detainers – which he said includes Montgomery County – account for 46% of at-large sex offender arrests.

On Tuesday, ICE told Fox 5 that a Salvadoran national charged this week with the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland had been arrested twice in Montgomery County and released both times despite ICE lodging a detainer. Elrich said his initial arrests were for theft and were not on the list of violent crimes that would have resulted in him being turned over to ICE.

Reeves says ICE will go into the community and locate many of those illegal aliens, and brought them into custody, but stressed that releasing them onto the streets poses a threat to both ICE agents and the public.

""Any at-large operation like that, it's just an inherent risk and risk to the officer and risk to the subject of our arrest and it's a risk to normal day-to-day citizens that happen upon the scene,"" he said.

""The most violent of folks potentially have weapons on them. You can have incidents where… they take off in their vehicles and crash into other folks. It's just a whole host of issues that would not occur if the detainers were being honored. We could come to the jails and we can take them out of the jails in a safe environment and move them toward their immigration hearings.""

He also stressed that it is not a major burden on state and local jurisdictions.

""We're not asking any of these jurisdictions that are unwilling to cooperate to hold anyone for us beyond the 48 hours after their state release. What we are asking is to have advance notice of 48 hours so we can have the resources made available to pick up these individuals and in a very safe manner,"" he said.

In 2021, the Biden administration implemented significantly narrowed ICE enforcement priorities, limiting ICE to recent border crossers, national security threats and public safety threats. So Reeves stressed that the illegal immigrants they are typically targeting are normally serious criminals.

""We are focused on egregious offenders, major public safety threats and, national security threats. We are not focused on the single mother, migrant mother who happens to steal diapers or formula from the local bodega to feed her children. We are interested in guns. We're interested in sex trafficking, human trafficking, violence, rape, murderers, gangs. Those are the people that we're concentrating on.""

In its statement, the county said the meeting is one of a number of such meetings, and the two sides will be meeting again in the coming weeks.

""The County cleared up some misconceptions about our policy on immigration enforcement (ie Montgomery County is not a sanctuary county) and ICE underscored their need for more notice prior to releases,"" the statement said.

""Director Reeves offered resources and training for our Department of Corrections staff and the County shared our policy on notification to allow ICE to provide feedback,"" the statement said.

The meeting comes as ""sanctuary"" policies have come into focus after a number of high-profile crimes have been committed by illegal aliens after they have been previously arrested and then turned back onto the streets despite an ICE detainer lodged against them. In New York City, one of the most high-profile sanctuary cities, Mayor Eric Adams said this week that sanctuary laws need to be modified to turn migrants who have committed felonies over to ICE.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The first son is expected to take questions from lawmakers and congressional investigators behind closed doors before the House Oversight and Judiciary committees.

The deposition was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.

Hunter Biden's expected testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Tony Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

He added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

Also last week, congressional investigators heard testimony from a former business associate of Hunter's — Jason Galanis, who is serving a 14-year prison sentence. Galanis testified during a rare transcribed interview from an Alabama prison that Joe Biden was allegedly considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.

Joe Biden's involvement would bring ""political access in the United States and around the world,"" he claimed.

JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES

Hunter Biden was first subpoenaed to appear for a closed-door deposition in November. The deposition was slated for Dec. 13, but the first son defied the subpoena. Instead of appearing to testify, he held a press conference on Capitol Hill during which he defended himself and his father, saying the president ""was not financially involved in my business.""

Ahead of his subpoenaed deposition, Hunter Biden had offered to testify in a public setting.

Comer and Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, rejected his request, noting that the first son would not have special treatment and pointing to the dozens of other witnesses who have appeared as compelled for their interviews and depositions. Comer and Jordan vowed to release the transcript of Hunter Biden’s deposition.

But after he defied the subpoena, the committees in January passed resolutions to hold the first son in contempt of Congress for defying the congressional subpoena. Before those resolutions were able to be considered by the House Rules Committee and the full House, Hunter Biden’s attorneys offered to discuss scheduling a new deposition for the first son — something House Republicans were willing to do.

HUNTER BIDEN DEPOSITION SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH AFTER RISK OF BEING HELD IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS

The president’s son’s deposition comes after years of congressional investigations into his business dealings, beginning in September 2019 in the Senate. That investigation was led by senators Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis.

Hunter Biden’s business dealings and foreign relationships came under heightened scrutiny in the fall of 2019 during the first impeachment of former President Trump.

Trump was impeached after a July 2019 phone call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine, specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings and Joe Biden’s successful effort to have former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin ousted.

FLASHBACK: GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SHARE HUNTER BIDEN'S CHINA-LINKED BANK RECORDS WITH US ATTORNEY LEADING CRIMINAL PROBE

Hunter Biden was quietly under federal investigation, beginning in 2018, at the time of the call, a probe prompted by suspicious foreign transactions.

Trump's request was regarded by Democrats as a quid pro quo because millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen. Democrats also said Trump was meddling in the 2020 presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a Democratic political opponent.

Republicans had been investigating Hunter Biden’s business dealings, specifically with regard to Burisma Holdings. House Republicans, who were in the minority at the time, made several requests to subpoena Hunter Biden for testimony and documents related to the impeachment of Trump and his business dealings that fell at the center of the proceedings.

FLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE

Biden has acknowledged that when he was vice president he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, and Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board, receiving thousands of dollars per month. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion of critical U.S. aid at the time if Shokin was not fired.

""I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion.' … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,’"" Biden recalled telling then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Biden recalled the conversation during an event for the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

""Well, son of a b----, he got fired,"" Biden said during the event. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

Biden allies maintain he pushed for Shokin's firing when he was vice president due to concerns the Ukrainian prosecutor went easy on corruption, and they say that his firing, at the time, was the policy position of the U.S. and international community.

FLASHBACK: HUNTER BIDEN 'TAX AFFAIRS' UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION; LINKS TO CHINA FUNDS EMERGE, SOURCES SAY

Now, as part of the impeachment inquiry, Republicans are investigating any involvement Joe Biden had in his son’s business dealings.

Last year, the federal investigation into Hunter Biden that began in 2018 also came under heightened scrutiny when two IRS whistleblowers claimed politics were influencing prosecutorial decisions throughout the years-long probe.

Those allegations sparked congressional investigations and, ultimately, the impeachment inquiry. They also put pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to give then-U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware David Weiss special counsel authority.

WEISS SAYS HE 'WASN'T GRANTED' SPECIAL ATTORNEY AUTHORITY IN HUNTER BIDEN PROBE DESPITE REQUEST: TRANSCRIPT

Special counsel Weiss indicted the first son on federal gun charges in Delaware last year. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges. His attorneys are attempting to have that case dismissed.

Also last year, Weiss charged Biden with nine federal tax charges, which break down to three felonies and six misdemeanors for $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid.

Weiss charged Hunter Biden in December, alleging a ""four-year scheme"" in which the president's son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.

A group of Democrats who started a movement in opposition to President Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza sent a clear message in the Michigan primary, exceeding the amount of votes the group was aiming for and complicating the key battleground state ahead of this year's general election.

""Yesterday was a resounding victory,"" Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who joined the ""Listen to Michigan"" movement, said during a news conference Wednesday claiming victory for the movement.

The comments come following the movement's push to have Democratic voters select ""uncommitted"" in Tuesday's Democratic primary surpassed the group's expectations, with just over 101,000 people selecting the option, according to Associated Press numbers as of Wednesday afternoon. That mark was more than 10 times the group's stated goal, which was to get 10,000 people, or roughly the same as the margin of victory in the 2016 election in the state, to select the option.

POLL SHOWS BIDEN'S LEAD OVER TRUMP SHRINKING IN 2024 MATCHUP AS CONCERNS OVER PHYSICAL FITNESS GROW

Despite the apparent resounding success, Biden easily captured the state and gained 115 delegates while hauling in over 81% of the vote, further solidifying his grasp on the nomination and setting up a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in November.

""I want to thank every Michigander who made their voice heard today. Exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy is what makes America great,"" Biden said in a statement after the Michigan victory while warning that there is ""much left to do"" to defeat Trump in November. ""You’ve heard me say many times it’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of America. It’s never a good bet to bet against Michiganders either. This fight for our freedoms, for working families, and for Democracy is going to take all of us coming together. I know that we will.""

Meanwhile, Listen to Michigan supporters have warned they are willing to continue growing the movement ahead of the general election, a potential headache for the Biden campaign in a battleground state that has seen close margins in the last two presidential elections.

JAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER 'UNCOMMITTED' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: 'HUGE PROBLEM'

Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a Biden campaign spokesperson noted that the share of uncommitted votes, 11%, was actually in line with the previous time an incumbent was on the ballot in the state in a Democratic primary, which was during the 2012 re-election campaign of Former President Barack Obama. Nevertheless, the spokesperson stressed that the campaign is still working hard to earn the votes of holdouts and will continue working towards peace in Gaza.

But the movement started by Listen to Michigan may not be in Biden's rearview mirror after Michigan, with the group saying activists in future primary states have reached out about joining the cause.

""Two of the states where organizers have reached out specifically are Minnesota and Washington State,"" a Listen to Michigan spokesperson said during Wednesday's news conference. ""We have our eye on those states… and are ready to have conversations with anybody organizing for an anti-war future.""

The organization has also brushed off suggestions that it may at least indirectly help Trump regain the presidency, arguing that it is up to Biden to earn their votes.

""We are not electing Donald Trump. President Biden is the one seeking the highest office, and he is the candidate who's facing off against Donald Trump,"" Hammoud said.

His younger brother, Jose, is charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another in the homicide of Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student.

Jose Ibarra is accused of killing Riley while she was jogging along a popular pedestrian loop around Lake Herrick on the University of Georgia's campus in Athens Feb. 22. The two brothers from Venezuela were living in the United States illegally. ICE confirmed Jose's illegal status earlier this week.

In a statement Thursday, ICE said Diego Ibarra had first entered the U.S. April 3, 2023, near Eagle Pass, Texas, but was removed via the COVID-era Title 42 process. He reentered April 30 and was enrolled into ""Alternatives to Detention,"" by which migrants are monitored via GPS tracking when released.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

He was released May 12, 2023, but by May 25 was judged to have bolted from the program after abnormalities with his GPS tracking device. Enrollees can be tracked in a number of ways, including a bracelet or a cell phone app. Last year, the administration pushed for a reduction in ICE detention beds and more funding for ATD but is now pushing for more detention beds.

The ICE statement said he has several arrests in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, but that ICE detainers — requests that ICE be notified when an illegal immigrant is being released for a transfer to ICE custody — were not honored.

The Athens-Clarke County Police Department told Fox News Digital it is not responsible for ICE notifications and does not have access to immigration status. It said that is instead handled by the Clarke County jail and directed Fox to the Clarke County Sheriff’s office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why the detainers were not honored.

The revelation comes a day after Athens Mayor Kelly Girtz repeatedly rejected the characterization Athens is a ""sanctuary"" city.

""There's been no legislation from this government that’s created sanctuary city status,"" he said.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Fox reported this week that Diego Ibarra was fired from the University of Georgia after it was discovered he presented a fake green card to work at the school's dining hall.

""Diego Ibarra presented a fake green card to the hiring unit to begin a temporary position as a dishwasher in Bolton Dining Hall at the University of Georgia on Feb. 6, 2024,"" UGA spokesperson Greg Trevor told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Diego then failed to ""submit further documentation required to keep the job and was never paid by the university"" before he was ""fired,"" Trevor added.

The White House on Wednesday issued a statement to Fox News Digital calling on local governments to work with ICE on deporting violent criminals.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities.

""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the southwest border. (The) 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013.""

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is urging the Department of Defense (DOD) to share information about the agency's contract with a Chinese-owned financial corporation that provides tutoring services for U.S. military families.

On Thursday, Cotton sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calling the business relationship with Hong Kong-based Primavera Capital Group ""ill advised, reckless,"" and a danger to U.S. national security.

Primavera, the capital group associated with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, owns the tutoring service Tutor.com and has provided critical funding to the TikTok giant.

""We should not be giving the Chinese communists access to the data of United States servicemembers and their families,"" Cotton, a member of the Senate's intelligence committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""I look forward to a full explanation from the Department of Defense on their continued use of Tutor.com.""

Like ByteDance and any other Chinese tech company, Primavera is subject to Chinese national security laws which require tech companies to release confidential business and customer data. Primavera acquired Tutor.com in January 2022.

""While providing educational services, Tutor.com collects personal data on users, such as location, internet protocol addresses, and contents of the tutoring sessions,"" Cotton wrote. ""As Chinese national security laws require companies to release confidential business and customer data to the Chinese government, we are paying to expose our military and their children’s private information to the Chinese Communist Party.""

Cotton also sought clarification on whether an internal review has been conducted to determine the continuation of the business relationship with Tutor.com, and if such a review has not taken place, an explanation is requested. Additionally, Cotton wants statistics on the annual usage of Tutor.com by military personnel or their dependents, and whether users are informed that their data may be shared with a Chinese company.

Cotton has previously called for a nationwide ban on TikTok, saying last month that the CEO is ""lying"" about the app being safe for users.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seeking to amend the city's sanctuary laws to exclude illegal migrants who have committed violent crimes.

Adams has mentioned his desire to tighten the city's regulations on illegal migrants multiple times this week, with his latest at a Tuesday press conference.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS DOUBLES DOWN ON CALL FOR CHANGES TO CITY'S 'SANCTUARY' STATUS AMID MIGRANTS CRISIS

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

This echoes the New York City mayor's previous remarks made during a Q&A session at an event on Monday.

""The overwhelming amount of migrants that are here, they want to work. I still don’t understand why the federal government’s not allowing them to work,"" Adams said Monday. ""They need to have the right to work like all of us that have come to this country had the ability to do so.""

MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS NEW YORK CITY HAS 'RUN OUT OF ROOM' FOR MIGRANTS: 'IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER'

""But those small numbers that are committing crimes, we need to modify the sanctuary city law that if you commit a felony, a violent act, we should be able to turn you over to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and have you deported.""

He added, ""It is a right to live in this city, and you should not be committing crimes in our city. Right now, we don’t have the authority to do so.""

Adams commended his administration on Monday for doing an excellent job during a challenging time, but he stated his hands are tied by federal and local law.

The mayor spoke about some migrants participating in robberies and using mopeds to commit snatch-and-grab stick-ups.

Adams has said before that migrants committing crimes should be handed over to ICE and deported.

Under the proposal from Republican Sen. John Polk of Hattiesburg, the board that governs the eight schools would choose three to close by June 30, 2028. The bill does not specify which institutions would close but says the board would make the decision based on enrollment, federal aid, tuition rates, degree programs and local economic impact.



MISSISSIPPI MAN GETS OVER 3 YEARS FOR RACIST, HOMICIDAL THREATS MADE ON SNAPCHAT

House Universities and Colleges Committee Chairman Donnie Scoggin, a Republican from Ellisville, said he had not studied Polk's bill, but a study committee to evaluate those metrics would be a necessary prerequisite.

""I am not for closing any of the colleges at this time without having a whole lot more knowledge,"" Scoggin told The Associated Press. ""I would not support that without knowing a whole lot more.""

Citing declining enrollment at several institutions, Polk has said the Legislature is appropriating too much money to keep the universities afloat. He declined to comment further on Wednesday.

Polk's proposal is not the first attempt to reduce the number of universities in Mississippi.

In 2009, then-Gov. Haley Barbour said Mississippi could not afford to keep all eight. Barbour, a Republican, proposed reducing the number to five by merging Mississippi University for Women into Mississippi State University and consolidating the three historically Black universities — Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi Valley State — into one school with Jackson State in charge. His proposal never gained traction because of widespread opposition from legislators and alumni groups.

Democratic Sen. Hillman Frazier of Jackson said Barbour’s failure showed there has never been a strong appetite for closing institutions in Mississippi. He also said the universities could reverse their enrollment declines with more state support.

""If you give the institutions the tools they need to attract students, that will address that,"" Frazier said. ""It sounds good politically, trying to be a fiscal conservative, but we need to give our universities the tools they need to be successful.""

Mississippi University for Women has attempted to recruit more students by switching to a name that doesn’t include the word ""Women."" But the university said last week that it was pausing that rebranding effort.

The eldest son of Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., was arrested Tuesday after several property thefts were reported in Rifle, Colorado, police said.

Tyler Jay Boebert, 18, faces five felony charges and more than a dozen misdemeanor offenses in connection to a recent string of vehicle trespass and property thefts, the Rifle Police Department said.

He is charged with four counts of criminal possession of ID documents belonging to multiple victims, one count of conspiracy to commit a felony and ""over 15 additional misdemeanor and petty offenses,"" the department stated.

""This is an ongoing investigation, no further information will be released at this time,"" Rifle police said, adding that all suspects are considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

REP. LAUREN BOEBERT'S EX-HUSBAND ARRESTED FOLLOWING ALTERCATION WITH CONGRESSWOMAN AT RESTAURANT

Online jail records show the teen is currently in the custody of the Garfield County Sheriff's Office. There is no bond information listed.

Reached for comment, Rep. Boebert said, ""I love my son Tyler, who has been through some very difficult, public challenges for a young man and the subject of attention that he didn't ask for.""

""It breaks my heart to see my child struggling and, in this situation, especially when he has been provided multiple opportunities to get his life on track,"" she said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""I will never give up on him and I will continue to be there for him. As an adult and father, Tyler will take responsibility for his actions and should be held accountable for poor decisions just like any other citizen.""

Boebert, 37, announced last year that her son Tyler, then-17, fathered a baby boy with his girlfriend, making her a grandmother.

Police were involved with Boebert's family earlier this year when officers received reports that the congresswoman was fighting with her ex-husband and Tyler's father, Jayson Boebert.

Jayson was arrested on Jan. 9 following the incident on charges of misdemeanor assault and criminal mischief. He was later released on bail from Garfield County Jail, according to the New York Post.

BOEBERT RESPONDS TO REPORTS OF FIGHT WITH EX-HUSBAND AT COLORADO RESTAURANT AFTER POLICE CALLED

A judge granted Boebert a temporary restraining order against her ex-husband earlier this month after she alleged Jayson threatened to harm her and himself.

In court papers, the lawmaker claimed her former spouse ""made multiple suicidal threats and threats to harm me over the past 14 months,"" according to the Denver Post.

Jayson told The Associated Press in an interview that he was the victim at the restaurant. ""I would never harm Lauren. I just want to move on and be in peace,"" he said.

He also accused his ex-wife of using the restraining order to ""justify"" her move to a new congressional district.

In her request, Boebert also cited a physical fight between her ex-husband and their 18-year-old son on Jan. 9. As Tyler called authorities, Jayson allegedly grabbed a rifle and left, according to court documents. Jayson was charged with harassment, prohibited use of a weapon and third-degree assault, court documents show. Boebert was not present during that altercation.

A Republican who has served two terms in the U.S. House representing the western side of the state, Boebert announced on Dec. 27 that she was switching congressional districts this year to run for a seat representing the eastern side of Colorado. The 4th Congressional District seat is open with the retirement of Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.

Six people were arrested Tuesday after police say they disrupted a city council meeting.

Officers were called to Seattle City Council chamber around 2:55 p.m. ""as people filled the room and continued to interfere with the session,"" police said in a news release.

The three men and three women were told to leave the chamber, but police say they refused and were told they would be arrested if they continued to interrupt. All six were charged with criminal trespass, and one of the men was also charged with obstruction.

Video of the meeting was posted on the city's Seattle Channel website, lasting just under two and a half hours. Two recesses were taken during that time, including one taken at the time police were called. It was supposed to last 15 minutes but went on for more than an hour.

Police say the city council meeting was able to resume after the arrests and many others left the chamber without any issues, but chanting and banging on windows could be heard when council members attempted to continue.

""Our physical safety is being threatened by the actions of the demonstrators outside banging on the windows, which could easily get broken, and we will have a mob scene,"" District 5 council member Cathy Moore said while asking for police assistance. ""I physically feel threatened.""

The protesters were referred to as ""progressive activists"" by local radio reporter Jason Rantz on the social media platform X. He said they were demanding that the city fund housing for refugees, even though ""they are not even being housed in Seattle currently.""

Many of them used the public comment portion of the meeting to talk about the issue.

""The issues of refugee housing and police surveillance are related,"" a woman named Lauren said. ""More money for police surveillance and ineffective and racist technologies like [‘Spothotter’] means less money for asylum seekers and other low-income people who desperately need housing.""

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday downplayed the notion that President Biden’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday was political and blamed Republicans for making the crisis worse.

President Biden and his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, are both scheduled to make dueling trips to the border on Thursday. Biden will visit Brownsville, while Trump will visit Eagle Pass, an area that has seen high levels of illegal crossings and has become a flashpoint in an ongoing battle between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the Biden administration.

Responding to a reporter’s question that Biden’s visit was merely in reaction to Trump’s visit – during an election year, no less – Jean-Pierre said the president’s schedule couldn’t just be upended on such short notice.

""[The president] has said that when Republicans rejected that Senate bipartisan bill on border security, on the immigration policy to fix a broken system that has been broken for decades, he said he was going to take it directly to the American people and also at the same time, hear from law enforcement and frontline personnel who deal with this issue every day,"" Jean-Pierre said.

President Biden, despite reversing many Trump-era border policies upon taking office, has repeatedly said his hands are tied on the border issue, saying the matter must be solved via legislation.

A bipartisan Biden-backed border security deal crafted by Senate negotiators amid an unprecedented surge in immigration collapsed in early February after Trump signaled his disapproval. That, in turn, has given the White House fodder to accuse Republicans of not taking the border issue seriously.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE, AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Jean-Pierre said Republicans, having rejected the deal, are ""getting in the way"" when it comes to fixing the border.

""This is not about politics for this president. This is about how we're going to fix an issue that the majority of Americans care about, a broken immigration system, the challenges at the border. That's why the president thought it was important to go at this time,"" Jean-Pierre said.

Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich noted that the administration has often criticized Republicans who go to the border to hold similar press conferences, writing them off as ""publicity stunts"" and ""photo ops.""

Jean-Pierre said Biden’s visit was ""very different,"" and repeated her assertion that Republicans ""constantly get in the way.""

""They consistently get in the way of what the president is trying to do to get more resources,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""They are turning this into a political stunt by listening to Donald Trump and saying that they need to kill it.""

On the suggestion that Biden just happened to be going to the border during an election year, despite it being a problem for the past three years, Jean-Pierre pointed to Biden’s ""comprehensive immigration policy"" implemented on day one of his presidency.

""He did that on the first day. That was his first piece of legislation. I would hope the American people would see how serious this president was or is about fixing this issue,"" she said.

MARYLAND COUNTY TO OPEN ICE COOPERATION AFTER PAST STONEWALLING, RELEASE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

After taking office, Biden signed two executive orders on immigration and pledged to roll back many of the policies put in place by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Within a few months, Biden took more than 90 actions related to the border.

Under the president’s stewardship, illegal immigration has skyrocketed to historic levels. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report for fiscal 2023 showed that the number of illegal immigrants on the non-detained docket soared from 3.7 million in FY 2021 to nearly 4.8 million in FY 2022 to nearly 6.2 million in FY 2023.

Thursday will mark Biden’s second visit to the border since taking office. The area he is visiting, the Rio Grande Valley, which includes Brownsville, gives Biden a platform where illegal crossings have dropped sharply.

The area is also a friendly congressional district that – as noted by Border Patrol Union President Brandon Judd – historically hasn’t seen much illegal traffic, in large part due to the infrastructure Trump provided while in office, and more recently due to the actions of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott since Biden took office.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

End of an Era

Longtime Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in an emotional speech in the Senate shortly after noon.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said. McConnell's first Senate term started in 1985, under the late President Reagan, and McConnell remained a huge fan (despite Reagan at first calling him ""Mitch O'Donnell -- Close enough""). But McConnell didn't reminisce much.

""There'll be plenty of time to express my gratitude and greater detail as I sprint towards the finish line, which is now in sight,"" he said.

McConnell's dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference after the November election, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, who said at a Fox News town hall recently: ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Yet after McConnell's announcement, gratitude poured in from both McConnell's allies and his critics. ""I’m grateful for his service.... I think Mitch's tenure has had many legacies. But no legacy is more consequential than the nomination and confirmation of hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary. And that is a lasting benefit to the American people for which I'm deeply grateful,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters.

McConnell said he intends to finish his current Senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

Oklahoma authorities are investigating a local high school after footage from a fundraiser event appeared to show students sucking and licking one another's toes last week.

The footage from Deer Creek High School in Edmond, Oklahoma, shocked and disgusted social media users across the country this weekend. Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters soon announced an investigation into the incident, calling it ""disgusting.""

The footage, originally obtained by Fox 25, was taken during a week-long fundraiser for a local coffee shop that employs people with special needs. Students from 9th through 12th grade volunteered to take part in various class competitions that students paid to attend, according to the outlet.

The video shows student volunteers who were paired up, one set sitting on chairs while the others laid down below them and licked peanut butter off of their toes.

""This is disgusting,"" Walters said in a statement on Friday. ""We are cleaning up this filth in Oklahoma schools. Our agency is investigating.""

Outrage librarian Libs of TikTok soon shared the footage on social media, demanding to know ""who approved this."" The account mistakenly claimed that the students were paired up with adults in the activity, however.

Reactions to the incident rolled in, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declaring ""this is child abuse.""

Walters then replied to Cruz' statement, saying ""Completely agree. We are stopping this in Oklahoma.""

Parents and students also reacted in statements to Fox 25. One parent who spoke with the outlet anonymously said

""It was surprising,"" one student told the outlet. ""I didn't think they were going to do all that. I was just shocked. I didn't really have like a feeling. I was kind of disgusted, and then kind of glad I wasn't over there.""

""Whenever she told me yesterday that was happening, I had to ask her, 'Wait, what? They're licking peanut butter off of toes? What?"" one parent said of a conversation with their student.

Meanwhile, the school celebrated the ""success"" of the fundraiser in a public statement.

""This afternoon, Deer Creek High School announced a grand total of $152,830.38 raised for Not Your Average Joe Coffee, an organization created to 'inspire our community by including students and adults with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities,"" school staff wrote.

""On Thursday, February 29, 2024, Deer Creek High School hosted an assembly called the Clash of Classes for students who paid to attend. During this assembly, ninth through twelfth grade students volunteered to participate in various student-organized class competitions, in the spirit of raising money for NYAJ. All participants in the assembly were students who signed up for the game(s) they played ahead of time. No Deer Creek faculty or staff participated in any of the games during this Clash of Classes assembly. Many dedicated students gave generously of their personal time to achieve this momentous accomplishment, which will serve communities beyond the boundaries of Deer Creek. We would like to thank all of the patrons, businesses and sponsors who contributed to the success of this year’s Wonderful Week of Fundraising,"" the statement continued.

The tax credit bill received bipartisan support, passing the chamber by a vote of 162-3. It provides a state income tax credit of up to $300 that could be used to pay for training and gun storage devices.

But Democrats decried the second bill banning the merchant code as a giveaway to the gun lobby that would make the state less safe.

STATE DEMS ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘BACKDOOR GUN TAX’ ON LAWFUL FIREARM OWNERS

Both bills now go to the state Senate for consideration.

Merchant category codes exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers. In 2022, Visa and other credit card companies said they would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, though they later put that decision on hold in the face of opposition from the gun lobby and conservative politicians.

There had been hope that categorizing credit and debit card purchases would allow authorities to potentially see red flags — like significant ammunition purchases — before a mass shooting could happen.

Republican state Rep. Jason Ridley, noting the ISO is based in Switzerland, said the code could be used to create a registry of gun sales.

""I don’t care which side of firearms you stand on,"" he said. ""Nobody should know what you’re buying and keeping a registry, especially a foreign country.""

Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state.

""She probably should drop out,"" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. ""I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.""

But Jodi said ""she should still stay in the race.""

""She's a better candidate than Trump,"" she added.

Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday.

""I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,"" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. ""I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.""

""I really don't know what she's doing,"" he continued. ""She's out of control.""

Similarly, Scott said, ""she needs to get out"" of the race. ""It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,"" he added.

KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT

Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman.

""She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do."" George said. ""If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.""

But Dan said he had ""no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.""

""She’s got no path to victory,"" he continued.

Theresa said: ""She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.""

Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination.

""I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.""

Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because ""we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.""

""I like Trump,"" he said. ""Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.""

But Josh said Haley's effort ""seems pointless.""

""It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,"" he told Fox News, ""which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden's predictions of a cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel are looking too sweet to be true, with multiple Hamas officials rejecting the current deal.

Biden predicted between licks of an ice cream cone on Monday that Hamas would accept a deal with Israel in the coming days, but statements from Hamas officials show little hope of progress.

""I hope by… the end of the weekend,"" Biden said Monday with cone in hand. ""My national security advisor tells me we’re close. We’re close. It’s not one yet. My hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a cease-fire.""

Meanwhile, multiple Hamas officials indicated on Tuesday and Wednesday that no breakthrough in negotiations had been made, according to The New York Times.

ISRAELI SECURITY EXPERTS SAY BIDEN’S PALESTINIAN STATE PUSH IS AN ’EXISTENTIAL THREAT’

""We are not interested in engaging with what’s been floated, because it does not fulfill our demands,"" Hamas official Ahmad Abdelhadi said in an interview with a Lebanese broadcaster.

BIDEN TO GO TO UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO FORCE TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE ON ISRAEL, HALT RAFAH OFFENSIVE

More concerning, Hamas spokesman Basem Naim said the terrorist organization had not even received ""any new proposals"" since the parties met last week.

Hamas is not the only party warning Biden to pump the brakes. Qatar, which has played a major role throughout the negotiations, indicated on Tuesday that there is no deadline for an agreement.

""The efforts are ongoing; all the parties are conducting regular meetings,"" Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters, according to NYT. ""But for now, while we certainly hope it will be achieved as soon as possible, we don’t have anything in our hands so as to comment on that deadline.""

Meanwhile, Israel is deep in the planning process for an expected invasion of Rafah, the Gaza town on the border with Egypt that plays host to both the final remnants of Hamas and key routes for aid.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an invasion would proceed at some point regardless of whether a cease-fire agreement is reached.

President Biden visited the southern border in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday, and was joined by a number of top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but Vice President Kamala Harris was not among them.

Biden spoke in Brownsville after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He urged Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that he believes will help solve the raging crisis at the southern border.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

BIDEN, DURING VISIT TO OVERWHELMED BORDER, URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK SENATE BILL: ‘TIME TO ACT’

But the vice president, who was tasked in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration, was not there.

The administration had initially leaned firmly into the root-causes narrative in early 2021, claiming that those causes – which include climate change, violence, poverty and economic insecurity – were driving migration to the U.S. border. Its answer, therefore, was to engage with governments and to invest in targeting those causes, eventually bringing migration down.

The assignment quickly led to Harris being dubbed the ""border czar"" – a title the White House rejected, stressing instead that it was more to do with international engagement. She would go on to visit the border in El Paso in June 2021 after facing pressure.

As part of that effort, Harris has been attempting to rally private-sector investment to the region via a Call to Action – particularly into the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

""First, I do believe most people don't want to leave home. They don't want to leave their grandmother. They don't want to leave the place where they worship and the community that they've always known,"" Harris said in 2022. ""And so, when they do, it is usually for one of two reasons: They are fleeing harm, or to stay means they simply cannot satisfy their basic needs or the needs of their family.""

A year ago, Harris announced an additional $950 million in response to the Call to Action, bringing in a total of more than $4.2 billion since May 2021.

But since then, her public role only appears to have continually shrunk, even amid a historic year for illegal immigration, with more than 2.4 million migrant encounters in FY 23. FY 24 has been similarly overwhelming, with over 300,000 encounters in December.

Harris was not part of the border tour on Thursday, nor was she part of a delegation to Mexico City in December with Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

In that meeting, the two countries, according to a White House readout, ""reaffirmed their existing commitments on fostering an orderly, humane, and regular migration.""

""This includes reinforcing our partnership to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, inequality, and violence, and for the two countries’ initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans,"" it said.

Yet, despite the discussions on root causes, Harris was not in attendance. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.

The L.A. Times recently reported that Harris will meet with new Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo in Washington to announce more private-sector investment.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

But root causes, while still on the agenda, have appeared to be less of a focus for the administration in its border strategy — in part because the migration surge has increasingly been coming from countries coming outside of the Northern Triangle, including from Venezuela, Nicaragua and China.

The administration is now focused on passing the Senate border bill, which has bipartisan support but has struggled to gain enough support to pass due to conservative opposition. The bill includes additional funding for staffing at the border, funding for cities and NGOs, as well as rules tightening asylum and a mechanism to shut down entries when they reach a certain level. Conservatives say it would codify an unnecessarily high level of illegal entries.

Harris has put out a statement calling for Congress to pass the bill earlier this month.

""Let us remember: we are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants have always helped strengthen our country, grow our economy, and drive innovation. We know that in America, diversity is our strength,"" she said. ""So rather than politicize this issue, let us all address it with the urgency and seriousness it requires.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Washington state Republican Chair Jim Walsh has called having voters write their party affiliation on the outside of their mail-in ballot a ""questionable design decision"" as some Washingtonians have raised concerns.

Walsh told Fox News Digital on Friday the requirement to declare one’s party is ""codified in law"" and is only for the primary, not the general election.

""The design where the attestation, the declaration is on the outer part of the envelope, that is not state law, that is a guideline, an administrative decision made by the Washington Secretary of State in conjunction with local county level election officials,"" he said.

Walsh added, ""That is not statutory, that’s just a questionable design decision by the Secretary of State working in conjunction with the local county elections people.""

Walsh said state Republicans have been trying since 2016 to change the law requiring voters to declare their party ""so that people can choose to be unaffiliated,"" but have been blocked by the Democrat-led legislature.

One X user snapped a photo of their ballot envelope, showing where voters must declare themselves as Democrats or Republicans, writing on Thursday, ""New Washington State envelopes for mail-in ballots. NEVER had to disclose my party declaration on the OUTSIDE of my ballot before. Don't feel really good about this.""

Cartoonist Scott Adams reposted it, writing, ""How can this be real?"" and X owner Elon Musk responded, ""What!?""

Another voter wrote, ""QUESTION- Why am I REQUIRED to list party affiliation on the outside of the envelope to VOTE?""

A third X user posted a picture of their envelope, writing, ""Washington State Presidential Primary Ballot … you have to declare on the outside of the envelope?!? Also no option for independents! This is how ballots get tossed before they can even be counted!""

""We’re not keen on the law, but we understand it is the law and that we do need to comply both with state law and with some national and with some national party rules,"" Walsh told Fox News Digital of the requirement to declare a party.

He said the ""spirit of the law"" is to keep voters from people from ""gaming the system, being part of one party and trying to vote in the other party’s primary"" but he felt there could be genuine security concerns with the declaration being on the outside of the ballot.

He told Seattle-area radio host Jason Rantz this week that he suggests voters take their ballot to a ballot box rather than mailing it in.

""Deliver it to a ballot box. Or give it to a trusted person to deliver,"" he said.

But Rantz noted in an opinion piece, that ""Fraud at the primary stage doesn’t make a whole lot of sense this election cycle. Donald Trump will be the nominee and it’s unlikely any other candidate would come close enough for stealth fraud to take place. And while fraud (and mistakes) obviously occur, there’s been no recent evidence of widespread fraud that would be enough to change national elections. But voters rightly remember the scandal around the recount between then-gubernatorial candidates Dino Rossi (R) and Christine Gregoire (D).""

The Washington Secretary of State’s Office has included examples of protests voters wrote on their ballots in 2016 — in showing voters the correct way to mark their ballot — that included statements such as, ""Actually I’m an Independent but if it makes you happy,"" ""Don’t tell me what I need to be … the voters are furious"" and ""I feel like I am being forced to choose a party and that’s not fair.""

The voter's party declaration choice is removed after 60 days, according to the secretary of state's office, noting on its website, for the ""Presidential Primary only, the major political parties require voters to mark and sign the party declaration. If you choose to participate, your choice of party will not affect how you may vote in future elections. You must mark and sign the political party declaration (box) on your envelope for your vote to count.""

The office has not clarified why the declaration is on the outside of the ballot. Fox News Digital has reached out to the secretary of state's office.

A New York state appeals court has denied an attempt by New York City leaders to implement a law that would let non-citizens vote in local elections.

In a 3-1 ruling issued Wednesday by the Appellate Division for the Second Judicial Department, the body said the law violated the New York Constitution and Municipal Home Rule Law.

It ""must be declared null and void,"" the court said in a 43-page ruling.

The law was passed in December 2021 by the City Council and created a class of ""municipal voters,"" comprising non-citizens who reside in the city for at least 30 days before an election and register or pre-register to vote. Municipal voters would be granted the right to participate in elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president and council member.

WISCONSIN'S GOP-LED LEGISLATURE MAKES SECOND ATTEMPT TO DRAW MAPS BEFORE SUPREME COURT DOES

The law faced legal challenges almost immediately.

It would have applied to some 800,000 new eligible voters in a city of 8.5 million. However, the appellate court said that the clause in the state constitution that says ""every citizen shall be entitled to vote…"" applies exclusively to U.S. citizens.

""As there is no reference to non-citizens, and thus, an irrefutable inference applies that non-citizens were intended to be excluded from those individuals entitled to vote in elections,"" the court said.

New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022. It was ruled illegal several months later. The mayor defended the law and appealed a lower ruling against it.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Adams' office and it was not clear if he would appeal Wednesday's ruling.

REPUBLICAN PARTY INFIGHTING ESCALATES IN OHIO AS MARCH PRIMARY NEARS

Many Democrats championed the law, saying it would make the city's politics more inclusive, while Republicans contended it could lead to voter fraud and that Democrats were only looking to pad their numbers.

""Great news! We won in the appellate court and @NYCMayor’s attempt to implement the law to register non-citizens to vote in #NYC elections has been struck down,"" U.S. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-New York, posted on X. ""This is a big victory in preserving both the integrity of our elections & the voice of American citizens!

Malliotakis, who represents New York's borough of Staten Island, was one of several plaintiffs to sue over the law, along with Borough President Vito Fossella.

""Fortunately, common sense prevails in New York, thanks to the decision reached by the Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department. The New York State Constitution is clear in that only citizens can vote in our local elections. It is simply irresponsible and nonsensical to extend this right to non-citizens. We are pleased that the Appellate court shared this understanding. This is a win for New York citizens and upholds the integrity of our elections,"" Fossella said.

The New York Immigration Coalition said it was disappointed in the ruling.

""For generations, New York City’s culture and economy have benefited from the immigrants who have come here to work, raise their families, uplift their communities and pay taxes in New York,"" NYIC Executive Director Murad Awawdeh said in a statement. ""While we are still reviewing the decision and its impact on immigrant New Yorkers, the lawsuit remains another shameful attempt by xenophobic Republicans who would disenfranchise residents rather than promote a more inclusive and participatory democracy. Immigrant New Yorkers deserve a say in how their local government functions and spends their tax money, and we remain committed to ensuring the expansion of voting rights.""

The ruling comes as New York City is grappling with a surge in migrants that has resulted in an uptick in crime and anger from residents. In December, Adams warned that the city was at its ""breaking point"" as city resources and shelter services had become strained.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

After coming into office in 2021, Biden regularly launched rhetorical bombs at Georgia and other states as being ""Jim Crow 2.0"" or ""Jim Eagle,"" for requiring voter ID for mail-in voting. However, Georgia allows three weeks of early voting.

Delaware Superior Court Judge Mark H. Conner ruled in a 25-page opinion, ""The enactments of the General Assembly challenged today are inconsistent with our Constitution and therefore cannot stand.""

Delaware’s constitution in Article 5 Section 1 states that a ""general election shall be held biennially on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November."" The Delaware early voting law, enacted in 2019, allows in-person voting up to 10 days before an election.

FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS DOJ PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE BLACK GEORGIA VOTERS WOULD BE HURT BY SHORTER EARLY VOTING

""The conflict between these two passages is obvious,"" the judge wrote. ""Our Constitution enumerates the one day an election shall be held biennially, and the Early Voting Statute allows for voting at least 10 days before that date.""

The Delaware Board of Elections argued that the words, ""election shall be held"" refers to the last day votes can be cast.

MICHIGAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION GIVES COMMUNITIES MORE TIME TO HANDLE ABSENTEE BALLOTS

The plaintiffs in the case were Delaware state Sen. Gerald Hocker, a Republican, and Delaware resident Michael Mennella, an inspector of elections for the Delaware Department of Elections. Mennella was represented by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a Northern Virginia-based election watchdog group.

""This shows that states have to follow their own constitutions,"" J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Fox News Digital.

He noted this comes days after a New York state appeals court ruled that New York City’s law to allow noncitizens to vote in municipal elections violated the state constitution.

When asked about Biden’s remarks toward other states such as Georgia, Adams said there was some irony.

""There is a little bit of irony, though he never served in the Delaware legislature that passed these laws,"" Adams said. ""But if he wants to talk about state voting, he might want to devote his energy to Delaware.""

Currently 46 states and the District of Columbia allow early in-person voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That tally includes Delaware, which could still appeal the decision.

Neither the Delaware Board of Elections nor the state attorney general’s office responded to inquiries from Fox News Digital for this story about whether there were plans to appeal. Adams said he was not aware of the state’s plans.

This marks Mennella and the legal foundation’s second victory over the state of Delaware in less than two years. In December 2022, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in Mennella’s favor when he challenged the constitutionality of the state’s universal vote-by-mail and same-day voter registration laws.

The lower court judge on Friday also determined a provision of the early voting law that allowed registered voters to get permanent absentee voting status was unconstitutional based on Article 5 Section 4A. This section was added to the state constitution in 1943 and specifies conditions when someone is ""unable to appear"" for in-person voting because a voter is away from home or is sick or disabled. This would also be determined on a per-election basis.

""By granting indefinite absentee voting to those who are unable to vote in a single election extends beyond the limited authority granted to the General Assembly by our Constitution,"" the judge ruled.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Trump and his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were barred earlier this month from operating their business in New York for a range of two to three years. Trump was also found liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

TRUMP BARRED FROM OPERATING BUSINESS, ORDERED TO PAY OVER $350 MILLION IN NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

The former president is appealing the ruling.

On Wednesday, though, a New York Appeals Court judge ruled that the former president must post a bond for the full amount of the judgment and the independent director of compliance will be appointed.

The judge will temporarily allow Trump and his sons to continue running the business as they appeal the decision.

The filing is a temporary order before the motion goes before the full Appeals Court. James’ brief to the panel is due March 11, and Trump's replies are due March 18.

The ruling comes after New York Judge Arthur Engoron handed down his decision earlier in February after a months-long trial beginning in October and stemming from James' lawsuit alleging the former president inflated his assets and committed fraud.

Engoron ruled that Trump and other defendants were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The judge also barred Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or legal entity in New York for two years.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Engoron also ""permanently"" barred defendants Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and former corporate controller Jeffrey McConney from ""serving in the financial control function of any New York corporation or similar business entity registered and/or licensed in New York State"" and as a director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in New York for three years.

James brought the lawsuit accusing Trump and the Trump Organization of fraudulent business practices. The court proceedings were contentious, with Engoron repeatedly placing Trump under a partial gag order to prevent him from criticizing court staff.

James had sought $370 million, plus 9% interest in penalties from Trump. Any awarded funds would go to the New York State Treasury, unless directed elsewhere by the state comptroller.

Trump dismissed the trial as a ""witch hunt"" throughout the process, accusing both Engoron and James of serving as political operatives for Democrats. Trump's legal team also repeatedly blasted the lack of a jury in the trial.

""There was never an option to choose a jury trial,"" a Trump spokesperson told Fox News Digital last month. ""It is unfortunate that a jury won’t be able to hear how absurd the merits of this case are and conclude no wrongdoing ever happened.""

Trump and his family denied any wrongdoing, with the former president saying his assets had been undervalued. Trump's legal team insisted that his financial statements had disclaimers, and made it clear to banks that they should conduct their own assessments.

JUDGE IMPOSES PARTIAL GAG ORDER IN TRUMP ORG TRIAL, BLOCKING PARTIES FROM VERBAL ATTACKS AGAINST COURT STAFF

Trump has said his financial statements were ""perfect,"" and stressed that the bank loans were repaid and ""as happy as can be.""

Throughout the trial, Trump attorneys brought witnesses, including former Deutsche Bank top executives, who testified the banks sought additional business from Trump, whom they viewed as a ""whale of a client.""

Trump's defense also brought in expert witnesses, including New York University accounting professor Eli Bartov, who reviewed the Trump financial statements at issue in the case and said he found no evidence of accounting fraud.

Bartov testified last month that Trump’s financial statements did not violate accounting principles, and he suggested that anything problematic — like a huge year-to-year leap in the estimated value of his Trump Tower penthouse — was simply an error.

The U.S. delivered its first air drop of aid supplies to Gaza on Saturday, with President Biden's administration saying it would be a ""sustained effort"" to bring more food and other aid.

The first of the airdrops landed in Gaza on Saturday, delivering some 38,000 MREs, or meals ready-to-eat. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says drops will continue throughout the coming weeks in partnership with Jordan and other allies.

""We need to do more and the United States will do more,"" Biden told reporters on Friday. ""Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough.""

The U.S. is also considering the delivery of aid by U.S. navy vessels in the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Gaza.

PALESTINIAN HUNGER CRISIS CONTINUES AS DESTROYED BAKERIES STRUGGLE TO REOPEN

The U.S. delivered the aid in a joint operation with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, according to a statement from CENTCOM.

Saturday's drop comes after more than 100 people were reported dead and hundreds more wounded when Palestinians rushing toward trucks loaded with humanitarian aid encountered fire in Gaza City early Thursday, according to local media reports.

The exact circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear; while several reports suggested Israeli troops fired on the crowd as they descended upon the trucks, the Israeli military suggested that most who died were trampled.

Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, said at least 104 people were killed and around 760 were wounded, describing the incident as a ""massacre.""

Israel has contested that description, however, saying the vast majority of those killed in the incident were trampled in the rush toward aid.

""Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip , Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered,"" Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling. The incident is under review.""

The IDF suggested that fewer than 10 civilians were injured by Israeli forces opening fire during the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Hamas says it holds Israel and Biden's administration ""fully responsible"" for the incident and for the ""ethnic cleansing"" of its people. The group called for worldwide demonstrations against Israel's bombardment of Gaza.

Former President Trump attacked his Republican opponent Nikki Haley on Saturday, claiming that former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is ""a little bit"" smarter than her.

Trump addressed an enthusiastic crowd in Richmond, Virginia on Saturday night, days before the Super Tuesday votes are scheduled to take place.

Earlier on Saturday, Trump won the Idaho, Missouri, and Michigan Republican contests. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in the evening, the former president lamented about media coverage of his statements referring to President Biden as ""President Obama.""

Trump maintained that he refers to Biden as ""Obama"" intentionally. He also acknowledged that he has mixed up Haley, who he calls ""Birdbrain,"" with Pelosi.

""I purposely mix up a name, like Birdbrain… you know who Birdbrain is, right, Nikki, with Nancy Pelosi,"" he began.

""I put them in because they're interchangeable in my mind,"" Trump added. ""Except I have to say, I shouldn't say this about a semi-Republican, but I think Pelosi's probably a little bit smarter, actually.""

In January, Haley said that Trump was not ""mentally fit"" for office after he referred to Pelosi as Haley during a speech.

""Last night Trump is at a rally and he’s going on and on, mentioning me multiple times as to why I didn’t take security during the Capitol riots. Why I didn’t handle Jan. 6 better. I wasn’t even in D.C. on Jan. 6. I wasn’t in office then,"" Haley said during a January rally in Keene, New Hampshire.

""They’re saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he’s talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario.""

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

AIR FORCE VET SEEN IN CAPITOL WITH ZIP TIES INTENDED 'TO TAKE HOSTAGES,' PROSECUTOR SAYS

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

Instances of antisemitism and Islamophobia have both risen in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, when militants entered the southern part of the country and slaughtered more than 1,200 people during a music festival.

Israel has responded with heavy shelling and a ground invasion of Gaza. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not delineate between fighters and civilians, has said that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed so far.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

HALEY SAYS US WILL HAVE 'FEMALE PRESIDENT' — EITHER HERSELF OR KAMALA HARRIS

""Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,"" the user added. ""If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

One user responded: ""Vasu Abhiraman (left) is quite partisan, actually.""

""I really appreciate community notes!"" added another.

And, ""Community Notes FTW [for the win].""

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

The former president began his remarks from the border Thursday afternoon by saying he spoke to the parents of Riley, who he described as ""an incredible young lady.""

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" he said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Trump's visit to the border coincided with President Biden's own trip to a different section of the border between Texas and Mexico. Biden did not mention Riley in his public remarks.

Trump detailed the brutal murder of 22-year-old nursing student Riley last week.

""A beautiful 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia was barbarically attacked. She was on a morning run… she was a beautiful young woman,"" he said. ""I spoke to her parents yesterday, they are incredible people. They are devastated beyond belief. She was so beautiful in so many ways.""

Trump said she was ""brutally assaulted, horrifically beaten, kidnaped, and savagely murdered.""

""The monster, the charge, charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump said, adding that he ""took the name from Hillary because she’s no longer relevant I guess.""

Trump, the 2024 GOP frontrunner, visited Eagle Pass, Texas, Thursday and toured Shelby Park with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and state officials. He also received a briefing and met with Texas officials, as well as Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council.

The former president and 2024 GOP frontrunner also met with Texas National Guard leadership.

Trump made remarks Thursday following the briefing and tour, slamming Biden for being ""incompetent,"" and for destroying the ""most secure border in history"" under his administration.

""I call him Crooked Joe because he's crooked and he's a terrible president, the worst president our country has ever had, probably the most incompetent president we've ever had,"" he continued. ""But it's allowing thousands and thousands of people to come in from China, Iran, Yemen, the Congo, Syria and a lot of other nations.""

Trump said many of those crossing are ""entire columns of fighting-aged men.""

Trump added that the border crisis ""is like a war… it’s a military operation.""

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

ICE CONFIRMS GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT ENTERED US ILLEGALLY, WAS PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED IN NYC

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, ICE confirmed he had been encountered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in August 2022, after entering near El Paso and was ""paroled and released for further processing.""

ICE also confirmed that Ibarra had been arrested by the New York Police Department a year later, on Sept. 14, 2023, and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation.""

When ICE learns that what it believes to be a removable illegal immigrant has been arrested on criminal charges, the agency will normally lodge a detainer — a request asking local law enforcement to keep the suspect in custody until they can be transferred to ICE and put into deportation proceedings.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER SUSPECT JOSE IBARRA LIVED WITHIN 5-MINUTE WALK OF UGA CRIME SCENE

In this case, however, ICE's statement says Ibarra was released before a detainer could be issued. NYC is also a ""sanctuary city,"" which generally restricts law enforcement from complying with ICE detainers.

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.

Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was ""election interference"" and ""weaponization against a political opponent."" Trump said he was being punished for ""having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.""

Former President Trump's campaign appealed a ruling from an Illinois judge that removed the 2024 presidential candidate from state ballots on Thursday.

The Trump campaign appeal contests Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter's ruling that Trump is disqualified from candidacy under the Constitutional ban on ""insurrectionists.""

Porter's ruling reversed last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter urged the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

The Trump campaign promised an appeal within hours of the ruling, and the order is currently on hold until litigation can be completed.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court battle will likely be rendered moot thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court taking up the same question in an upcoming case. In the case, the court will consider for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

The relevant section states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

Trump has not been charged with inciting an insurrection, but he does face allegations of election interference in Washington, D.C. and Georgia.

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

Former President Trump is leading President Biden in a new poll from the New York Times/Sienna College released Saturday, with voters saying they have little confidence in Biden's leadership.

The survey found that 43% of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 48% said they would vote for Trump. The poll further found that 47% of respondents ""strongly disapprove"" of Biden's handling of the presidency, in addition to 14% who said they ""somewhat disapprove.""

Just 17% stated that they ""strongly approve"" of Biden's handling of the job.

NYT and Sienna conducted the poll from Feb. 25-28, surveying 980 registered voters across the country. The poll was conducted in both English and Spanish using cellphones and landline telephones. It advertised a margin of error of 4%.

The poll further found that just one in four voters believe the country is headed in the right direction. And the number of Americans who believe Biden's policies have hurt them is double the number who believe they have helped, according to the Times.

With regard to the border, 50% of respondents said they would support restricting migrants' ability to apply for asylum, while just 43% said they would oppose the move.

The numbers were even worse for Biden when it comes to the economy, with 74% of Americans saying it is ""poor"" or ""only fair,"" compared to 26% who said the economy is doing ""good"" or ""excellent.""

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had ""devastating consequences,"" and demands immediate action.

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

""Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,"" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. ""Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.""

TRUMP BLAMES 'BIDEN'S BORDER INVASION' FOR LAKEN RILEY MURDER, VOWS 'LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION' IF ELECTED

They added, ""Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.""

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the ""invasion"" that led to Riley’s death.

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

RAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as ""belligerent.""

She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.

McAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it’s ""clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.""

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: 'LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

""We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election.

""If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,"" Haley said in the interview.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House.

""We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,"" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley blamed former President Trump Friday for recent Republican losses in critical electoral races, including those for seats in the Senate, while expressing hope the GOP's new leader in the upper chamber is focused on setting a tone rather than courting Trump.

""You're seeing the wave of what Congress thinks they need to do to win,"" Haley told reporters during a briefing at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood.

Haley was likely referencing Trump's dominance over the House and Senate relative to endorsements and influence.

But Haley suggested lawmakers who cater to the former president are misguided because Republicans have lost pivotal matchups since his presidency.

SENATE REPUBLICANS KEEP HOPE FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT ALIVE

""All of these losses happened after Donald Trump became president in 2016,"" she said, noting gubernatorial, federal and statewide losses in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia.

Haley claimed the only reason Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., was elected in 2021 was because ""he distanced himself"" from Trump.

Youngkin's political team declined to comment to Fox News Digital.

""It’s not an accurate statement,"" according to Zack Roday, a former Youngkin adviser and partner at Ascent Media.

DC PRIMARY REPRESENTS HALEY'S BEST CHANCE YET TO BEAT TRUMP

""Glenn Youngkin won because he built a movement and coalition of Republicans, independents and even Democrats who wanted a new direction for Virginia.""

Despite the losses, Haley claimed members of the House and Senate are now ""falling all over themselves to show that they're more Trump than everybody else.""

Haley weighed in on what the next Senate Republican leader should bring to the table after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's surprise announcement Wednesday that he's stepping down. She didn't suggest any specific senators for the role but explained she wants a leader focused on the people and ""not rewarding people for peacocking on TV.""

""I want to see somebody inspirational. I want to see somebody that says, ‘You know what, we can do things differently,'"" Haley said. ""My hope is that we will. But we'll have to see.""

Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital the campaign's focus is now on Biden and the general election.

""Republican voters have delivered resounding wins for President Trump in every single primary contest, and this race is over,"" she said.

Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father ""because there isn't any,"" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

""Do you think it started before she hired him?"" Merchant asked via text on Jan. 5, three days prior to filing the motion.

""Absolutely,"" Bradley replied.

But in court Tuesday, Bradley claimed he was ""speculating"" in those text message exchanges.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

Mike Dunleavy has threatened to veto an education package overwhelmingly passed by lawmakers after a bruising debate, saying it lacks provisions he favors, including a pilot program offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers.

Dunleavy, a former educator, said this week that there is still time for lawmakers to address issues like the proposed bonuses and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting such schools. The governor has 15 days, excluding Sundays, to act on a bill sent to him if the Legislature is in session.

He can sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. A decision is expected by March 14.

ALASKA FACES TEACHER SHORTAGE AS EDUCATION FUNDING DEBATE DOMINATES LEGISLATURE

Some key lawmakers say the package was a compromise and question whether the state can afford the bonuses — or even if they would work.

Debate over education funding has dominated this legislative session. The House last week voted 38-2 to support a compromise package that included a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula; language encouraging districts to use some of the extra funding for teacher salary and retention bonuses; a state education department position dedicated to supporting charter schools and additional funding for K-3 students who need reading help. The vote followed a period of intense debate that also showed divisions within the Republican-led majority.

The Senate, led by a bipartisan coalition, agreed 18-1 on Monday to support the package, sending it to Dunleavy.

The compromise stemmed from negotiations after the House failed to support bringing up for debate a version of the bill that advanced from the House Rules Committee. That version included Dunleavy’s bonus plan, charter provisions and a roughly $80 million increase in state aid through the formula.

After the bill passed the House, Republican Speaker Cathy Tilton said that while the compromise ""fell short"" of the earlier proposal, ""I’d still call it a ‘qualified’ success.""

School officials had sought a roughly $360 million increase in funding, citing the impact of inflation and high energy and insurance costs. But the state, which relies heavily on oil and earnings from Alaska's nest-egg oil-wealth fund, has struggled with deficits over the last decade, and some lawmakers questioned whether that amount was realistic.

The Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million boost last year, but Dunleavy vetoed half that. Lawmakers did not have enough votes for an override.

Dunleavy has cast the bonuses and support of charter schools as a way of doing things differently. He has questioned whether simply increasing funding to districts will improve student performance.

He has proposed paying teachers bonuses of $5,000 to $15,000 a year over three years, with the highest amount for those in the most remote areas. Estimates suggest the program could cost about $55 million a year.

The language in the education package encouraging districts to use some of the funds for bonuses ""does not ensure the desired ends are realized,"" Dunleavy spokesperson Grant Robinson said by email Thursday.

Republican Senate President Gary Stevens told reporters this week that there is a limit to what the state can afford. A revised revenue forecast is expected by mid-March, and lawmakers haven't even begun publicly debating how big this year's dividend payout to residents from oil-wealth fund earnings should be — typically one of the most contentious debates of the session.

Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, raised questions about how well bonuses might work. He said he thinks there's a ""fair expectation"" that teachers from overseas or the Lower 48 would leave after the three years is up.

He said the level of support for the compromise bill was ""pretty unheard of these days"" for a controversial measure.

Tom Klaameyer, president of NEA-Alaska, a teachers' union, said if Dunleavy vetoes the education package, ""then our schools remain in crisis.""

The measure ""was simply a life preserver that was being thrown or could have been thrown to schools to stem the crisis,"" he said.

He added: ""We’re saying, throw the life preserver.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Speaker Mike Johnson bucked the House GOP’s right flank to pass a short-term federal funding bill on Thursday, setting up Congress to avoid a partial government shutdown.

The bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), extends fiscal 2023’s government funding levels to two deadlines: March 8 and March 22. It passed the House, 320-99.

Majorities in both parties voted for the bill, although more Democrats than Republicans supported it – 113 GOP lawmakers voted for the CR while 97 voted against, and 207 Democrats voted for it versus just two who were opposed. In a modest win for Johnson, however, this CR got more GOP votes than the extension he put on the House floor in January, which got 107 Republicans' support.

Congress is currently operating under a CR passed in January that extended funding for some of its 12 appropriations bills to March 1 and others to March 8.

TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS FLEE CAPITOL HILL AMID RISING CHAOS, DIVISION: 'A BAD WORKPLACE'

House GOP leaders were forced to seek Democrat votes, which were likely anyway, to pass the bill. They fast-tracked it under suspension of the rules, meaning it forgoes the normal process of going through the House Rules Committee and a House-wide procedural vote in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.

It comes after GOP rebels weaponized procedural House votes several times to deliberately sink their own party’s legislation as a protest against leadership.

Many of those same rebels have pushed Johnson to allow for the government to shut down instead of extending the previous Democrat-controlled Congress’ funding levels. They argued that a shutdown, even a partial one, would give House Republicans leverage to push for conservative policies.

HOUSE GOP LEADERS JETTISON PROMISE TO VOTE ON 12 INDIVIDUAL SPENDING BILLS

With expected furloughs of federal employees and suspension of government programs, however, a government shutdown is a politically perilous outcome for both Republicans and Democrats.

This is the fourth CR the House has passed since fiscal 2023 ended on Sept. 30.

""We have to be willing to do what's difficult to save America. I'm not scared of a government shutdown if it's the price we need to pay to secure our border, get our debt under control and stop the government from going after my fellow Americans,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

But Johnson said during his weekly press conference that it would buy negotiators just enough time to release legislative text for their first six spending bills over the weekend while avoiding the negative effects of a partial shutdown.

""All of our members will have 72 hours to review it. That's our commitment. That's our rule. We're respecting it. And that's the only reason we need the process CR, to allow us time to do that,"" Johnson said.

""If I did it the way … [former House] Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi did, we just drop that bill and vote on it within hours. We're not going to do that.""

The CR must now pass the Senate and be signed by President Biden to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

CHINESE HACKERS HAD ACCESS TO US INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 'AT LEAST 5 YEARS' BEFORE DISCOVERY

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

The head of the union that represents Border Patrol agents across the country exploded on President Biden during a Thursday press conference, declaring agents were ""mad as hell,"" and ""p----d"" over his policies that allowed the situation at the border to deteriorate so badly.

National Border Patrol Council (NBCP) President Brandon Judd appeared alongside former President Donald Trump in Eagle Pass, Texas, which he described as the ""epicenter"" of the border crisis, as Biden held a dueling event a few hundred miles away at the less affected Brownsville, Texas.

""Sir, I want you to know your agents, my agents, they're mad as hell — absolutely mad that President Biden went to Brownsville, Texas, rather than going to Arizona, rather than going to San Diego, California, rather than coming to Eagle Pass, Texas, which has been the epicenter,"" Judd said after Trump invited him to the microphone to speak.

Judd said the trip allowed Trump to see how his policies worked compared to those implemented by the Biden administration, and that he had the clarity on how to expand them should he be elected president in November.

""Your agents … they are pissed. Border patrol agents are upset that we cannot get the proper policy that is necessary to protect human life, to protect American citizens, to protect the people that are crossing the border illegally,"" Judd said. ""We can't do that because President Biden's policies continue to invite people to cross here.""

""Thank goodness we have a governor like Governor Abbott. Thank goodness we have somebody that's willing to run for President of the United States, forego everything else he's been doing to serve the American people. Mr. President, thank you,"" he added.

President Biden signed a funding measure on Friday that was agreed upon by congressional leaders and passed in both the House and Senate, once again averting a government shutdown.

Biden signed H.R. 7463, a funding bill titled ""Extension of Continuing Appropriations and Other Matters Act, 2024,"" which extends the March 1 funding deadline for the first slate of appropriations bills by one week, pushing it to March 8.

Those bills will head to the House and Senate for votes in the next week.

The funding bill also moves the second deadline for a second slate of bills to March 22.

However, the second group of appropriations measures still need to be finalized and agreed upon before heading to the floor for votes.

""We are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Wednesday, along with House Appropriations Committee Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine.

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A Lubbock, Texas, federal judge ruled Tuesday that lawmakers unconstitutionally passed the $1.7 trillion government funding bill in 2022 when they did so under a pandemic-era rule allowing members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on the matter by proxy instead of in person.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, requested the courts block a provision of the funding bill that gave pregnant workers stronger legal protections.

U.S. District Judge Wesley Hendrix reviewed the request and issued a ""limited"" ruling on one of two provisions Paxton sought to have blocked.

Hendrix, appointed by former President Trump, ruled the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was wrongfully passed, blocking the law from being enforced against the state as an employer.

TEXAS AG KEN PAXTON SAYS STATE WON’T COMPLY WITH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ORDER TO REOPEN PARK TO FEDERAL AGENTS

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, enacted in December 2022, requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers.

In his ruling, Hendrix noted that his injunction is only applicable to state government employees.

Paxton filed a lawsuit last year, arguing the federal spending package was unconstitutionally passed because over half of the House of Representatives were not physically present to provide a quorum, yet they still voted by proxy.

EAGLE PASS MAYOR SAYS SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TEXAS, FEDS OVER BORDER CONTROL IS 'FRUSTRATING,' A 'CONSTANT STRUGGLE'

In May 2020, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, helped get a rule in place allowing lawmakers to vote by proxy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

When Republicans took control of the House in 2022, they ditched the proxy rule after challenging it in court unsuccessfully.

Hendrix said in a 120-page ruling that for over 200 years leading up to the voting proxy rule’s adoption, Congress understood that the majority of members of the House or Senate were required to be physically present to have a quorum to pass legislation, as stipulated under the Constitution’s quorum clause.

TEXAS AG PAXTON SUES NGO AIDING MIGRANTS, ACCUSES IT OF ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

""Supreme Court precedent has long held that the Quorum Clause requires presence, and the Clause’s text distinguishes those absent members from the quorum and provides a mechanism for obtaining a physical quorum by compelling absent members to attend,"" he wrote.

Paxton said Congress acted ""egregiously"" when it passed the $1.7 trillion funding bill.

""Congress acted egregiously by passing the largest spending bill in U.S. history with fewer than half the members of the House bothering to do their jobs, show up and vote in person,"" Paxton said. ""Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi abused proxy voting under the pretext of COVID-19 to pass this law, then Biden signed it, knowing they violated the Constitution. This was a stunning violation of the rule of law. I am relieved the court upheld the Constitution.""

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

Reuters reported that Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer Matthew Miller said the ruling ""correctly"" concluded a physical quorum was required to vote.

Hendrix also found in his ruling that Texas did not have standing to challenge $20 million appropriated in the bill to fund a pilot program providing case management and other services to noncitizens during immigration removal proceedings.

FIRST ON FOX — Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott slammed what he called a ""two-tiered standard"" concerning President Biden mulling executive action to handle the border crisis, and how former President Trump was treated during his presidency when he attempted to do the same thing.

""Well, there's no question that there's a two-tiered standard in our national media. The way they cover President Trump versus the way that they use kid gloves to cover Joe Biden. There's no question about that,"" Scott said during a Thursday interview with Fox News Digital when asked about reports that Biden is weighing executive action to crack down on asylum-seeking.

""More important, however, is that when we had President Trump in office, we actually had a basically sealed southern border. Crossings were around a thousand a day. Under President Biden in December, we had 10,000 crossings on average per day,"" he added. ""That contrast should be what the media is covering.""

TRUMP VP AUDITIONS: SCOTT RAMASWAMY HIT TRAIL IN SOUTH CAROLINA ON BEHALF OF FORMER PRESIDENT

An administration source told Fox earlier this week that Biden is considering executive action to restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum amid historic numbers of border crossings facing the country, but that it’s one of ""several"" plans being looked at.

An administration official also stressed that there have been no final decisions on what actions, if any, could be taken and that exploring policy options does not mean they will come to pass.

One of the options reportedly on the table is use of 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to restrict certain categories of foreigners who are deemed ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Trump attempted to use it but was blocked by a federal court, a ruling later upheld by the Supreme Court.

HISPANIC HOUSE DEMS ACCUSE BIDEN OF LEAVING THEM IN DARK ON POSSIBLE EXECUTIVE ACTION AT BORDER

The former president also faced sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the liberal media for attempting to use executive action on immigration, including being called ""xenophobic"" and ""racist.""

Biden has yet to face the same widespread level of criticism, although some of the more progressive Democrats have lashed out at the idea of Biden reverting to the previous administration's approach.

""Democrats CANNOT solve immigration problems by adopting Trump-like policies,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote in a post on X, while Rep. Jesús García, D-Ill., claimed, ""President Biden would be making a grave mistake if he moves forward with this policy.""

DEMOCRAT IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE UNDER FIRE FOR PAST AMNESTY, SANCTUARY CITY ‘SUPPORT’ AS BORDER CRISIS SPIRALS

The possible executive action by Biden comes just under two weeks after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border crisis.

During a gaggle with reporters after casting his vote in the South Carolina primary earlier in the day, Scott told Fox that he ""certainly"" supported Mayorkas' impeachment, and he praised the House for having the ""courage"" to take such action. However, he admitted the task likely wouldn't go anywhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

""The best way to eliminate Mayorkas being the secretary is to actually fire Joe Biden,"" he said. ""If we really want to change the trajectory of the country as it relates to immigration — illegal immigration — we have to do so by having someone, a commander-in-chief, who respects our borders, who wants to close our borders.""

Wade was hired in 2022 to help prosecute the sweeping case against Trump and 18 other co-defendants on charges related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including racketeering, violating the oath of office, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, forgery and false statements.

Four co-defendants in the case alleged in subsequent court filings that Wade was romantically involved with Willis at the time he was hired and that she financially benefitted from his employment because of their relationship and lavish vacations they took together.

Co-defendants have also alleged that Wade’s ""lack of experience"" prosecuting complex cases makes him ""unqualified"" to work the case and questioned why Willis hired him in the first place.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

A John Marshall Law School graduate, Wade worked in private practice at his firm Wade & Campbell prior to his work with the Fulton County DA’s office.

""Whether you are in need of representation after a major car accident or are going through a change in your personal life that requires representation with a family law issue; whether you have a contract dispute, or whether you are involved in any type of civil litigation, Nathan J. Wade will be a zealous advocate for you,"" his firm’s website reads.

The New York Times reported that public records show ""scant evidence"" that he has prosecuted major criminal cases, with no evidence that he has handled a major political corruption case or one involving the state’s ""complicated racketeering statute"" under which all the defendants in the Trump case have been charged.

FANI WILLIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH WINK ON THE STAND, LABELS FORMER LOVER NATHAN WADE A 'SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN'

In 1999, Wade spent four months as an assistant solicitor in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County. From 2011 to 2021, he was an associate municipal court judge in Marietta, Georgia, handling misdemeanor cases.

Wade ran for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court three times between 2012 and 2016 but lost each time.

5 EXPLOSIVE MOMENTS FROM FANI WILLIS' HEATED TESTIMONY IN TRUMP FULTON COUNTY CASE: 'IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN …'

Wade took the stand on Thursday during a tense court hearing to hash out evidence to allegations that Willis had financially benefitted from Wade’s employment.

Both Willis and Wade testified that Wade had routinely paid for the trips and that Willis would reimburse him with cash. When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep six months of regular expenses on hand in cash.

Wade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that had been made in cash.

Wade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims.

""You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?"" Gillen asked.

""No, sir,"" Wade said.

""Not a single solitary one,"" Gillen pressed.



""Not a one.""

Willis, in her testimony, called Wade a ""southern gentleman."" Willis said her relationship with Wade ended roughly last summer but that the two remain ""very good friends"" and are ""probably closer than ever because of these attacks.""

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradict testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office. Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" the Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

Yeartie testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021, and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, to when she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie's testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie to be a friend.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A transgender lawmaker stormed out of the Virginia Senate chamber in protest after Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears referred to the lawmaker as ""sir"" on Monday.

Sen. Danica Roem, a Democrat and the first transgender person to serve in the Virginia legislature, is biologically male but identifies as a woman. Roem asked a question about a piece of legislation during a general session on Monday afternoon.

""Madam President, how many votes would it take to pass this bill with the emergency clause?"" Roem asked.

""That would be four-fifths, Senator,"" Sears responded.

""And what would be the exact number of that, Madam President?"" Roem asked again.

""Yes, sir, that would be 32,"" Sears said.

Roem could then be heard putting down the microphone and leaving the chamber. The lawmaker did not cast a vote in the roll call vote moments later.

Sears offered an apology for the incident later in the session, though she did not specifically apologize for referring to Roem by the lawmaker's biological gender.

""I upset Sen. Roem,"" Sears said. ""Let it be known I am not here to upset anyone. I am here to do the job the people of Virginia have called me to do, and that is to treat everyone with respect and dignity. I myself have at times not been afforded that same respect and dignity.""

""But in this body, as long as I am president of the Senate and by the grace of God, I will be treated with respect and dignity, and I will treat everyone else with respect and dignity,"" she added. ""It is never my intention to make anyone offended, and I hope that others would consider that they would try not to offend me as well,"" she said. ""We are all equal under the law. And so I apologize, I apologize, I apologize, and I would hope, I would hope, that everyone would understand there is no intent to offend but that we would also give each other the ability to forgive each other.""

Please enter a valid email address.

FIRST ON FOX - Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and her former lover Nathan Wade are facing two ethics complaints from a conservative government watchdog group based on their court testimony on allegations they had an 'improper' affair.

The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) is requesting that the Georgia state bar open disciplinary proceedings against the Fulton County DA and Wade for violations of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct.

AAF is alleging Wade lied under oath about his relationship with Willis, and alleging that Willis admitted to keeping campaign money for personal use on the witness stand.

""To ensure that the citizens of Fulton County and the State of Georgia understand that the Bar will not countenance any violation of its ethics by those charged with upholding it, we urge you to revoke Ms. Willis’ license to practice law and permanently bar her from practicing law,"" adding the same request in a separate complaint against Wade.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

The complaint against Willis notes that on Feb 15. 2024 she testified before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee and was questioned regarding her reimbursement of Wade and her use of cash with no bank or transaction receipts. Willis was asked where the cash originally came from, to which she replied:

""Cash is fungible. I’ve had cash for years in my house. So for me to tell you the source of where it comes from ... when you go to Publix and you buy something and you get fifty dollars and you throw it in there. It’s been my whole life. When I took out a large amount of money during my first campaign, I kept some of the cash of that.""

AAF claims that Willis’ ""admission"" represents ""the admission of a clear violation of Georgia Campaign Finance law."" The portion of that law they say is applicable states that, ""Nothing in this Code section shall permit or authorize a candidate to utilize campaign funds for the purpose of making gifts, loans, or investments directly to: (A) The candidate…""

""The statute is unambiguous – and the facts are not in dispute – as Ms. Willis described in her testimony, she placed the money that was intended for her campaign into a ""fungible"" slush fund with other moneys that she would use for various other purposes, including reimbursing her boyfriend for leisure travel,"" the complaint states.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

The complaint also states that her ""keeping some of the cash"" was a ""willful intentional act and denied the citizens of Georgia the ability to exercise effective oversight over her campaign.""

""It is unreasonable to believe that a barred attorney running for public office would not have been aware that the strict reporting guidelines of Georgia campaign finance law existed to protect the public’s right to oversee elections and that she had an obligation to scrupulously abide by them,"" the complaint states.

The complaint against Wade alleges that he lied under oath on more than one occasion. When asked on an interrogatory to ""describe each instance in which you have had sexual relations with a person other than your spouse during the course of the marriage,"" and he said, ""none.""

Wade testified that his marriage ""was irretrievably broken in 2015"" but that he and his wife agreed to delay a divorce for the sake of their children.

""First it is simply not credible that Mr. Wade did not know that he had sexual relations with Ms. Willis when he replied to the interrogatories above in his divorce case. Put simply, it is clear Mr. Wade knew that he had had sex with Ms. Willis, and he knew that at the time he was still married, and he simply lied in the interrogatories,"" the AAF complaint states.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

""Whether he was married was not a complicated question. In fact, he was the plaintiff in a divorce case, a case that cannot proceed without the parties being married. As an officer of the court, this is simply unacceptable. It is challenging to think of a more clear-cut example of ‘dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,’"" the complaint says.

The complaint goes on to say that Wade’s ""rationale for not answering the interrogatories truthfully under questioning shows a whole lack of understanding of the law that makes him unfit to practice law in the State,"" deeming him a risk to future potential clients.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""The Bar owes the profession and the public a duty to guard the practice from charlatans and incompetents. Any simple reading of Mr. Wade’s testimony quickly reveals that he is so grossly unfamiliar with the simple understanding of a legal concept like marriage that the risk he and his incompetence poses to vulnerable members of the public requires his exclusion from the profession,"" it states.

Willis and Wade did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

House managers serve as ""prosecutors"" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.

One impeachment manager told Fox they had been given ""no clear guidance"" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.

Fox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Fox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.

RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS

Several factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.

That said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.

Some House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.

A senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a ""comprehensive briefing"" last week and ""detailed"" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.

Despite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that ""we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.""

Some House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.

Fox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing ""mock trial"" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.

HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS

""We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,"" said one frustrated manager.

There has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.

Managers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned ""subject lanes"" to argue before the Senate.

One manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.

FIRST ON FOX: A GOP lawmaker accused a nonprofit shelter network of sponsoring a migrant who was recently accused of killing a Georgia nursing student, letting him use its federally funded resources after he entered the U.S. illegally and before he allegedly committed the crime.

Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, sent a letter to Covenant House, a national network of youth homeless shelters, saying that Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) documents indicate that Jose Ibarra, 26, used a New York facility as his sponsor address after he crossed the border in September 2022.

Covenant House denied sponsoring Ibarra.

Gooden questioned whether Covenant House was properly vetting people who came through its doors, whether Ibarra lied about allegedly staying there, and if the organization was encouraging migrants to use its address on federal forms.

Covenant House told Fox News Digital it did not sponsor Ibarra and denied being contacted by federal authorities about him.

""Covenant House does not sponsor the entry of any migrants into the United States. It is neither a policy nor a practice. Covenant House New York did not sponsor Jose Antonio Ibarra’s entry into the country and has not done so for any other person,"" a spokesperson said.

""We do not know how our address came to be on his form, but there have been and continue to be instances when our address is given at the border. We have not been contacted by ICE/DHS regarding this matter, nor have we ever been contacted by them about the use of Covenant House’s name on a form at the border.""

Gooden's letter, sent to Covenant House CEO Bill Bedrossian, stated: ""According to CBP documents, after illegally crossing into El Paso, Jose Antonio Ibarra provided The Covenant House, a federally funded NGO in New York, as his sponsor address. These NGOs receive hundreds of millions in taxpayer funding per year through a left-wing loophole designed to circumvent a federal law that prevents tax dollars from funding illegal immigration.

""I have been fighting to hold NGOs like Covenant House accountable for years. Their usage of federal funds to traffic millions of migrants is unacceptable and has now become deadly.""

GEORGIA NURSING STUDENT FOUND DEAD ON UGA CAMPUS IDENTIFIED AS LAKEN RILEY

Ibarra is charged with murdering 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student Laken Riley, who was killed while jogging at the nearby campus of the University of Georgia.

Her death has sparked renewed scrutiny over how effectively U.S. officials are evaluating migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border before granting entry, primarily to await immigration court proceedings.

In his letter, Gooden asked Covenant House how long Ibarra had stayed at its facility, if he did, and whether Covenant House coordinates with groups in Mexico to share its address with people trying to enter the U.S.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

""Instead of prioritizing the safety and security of American citizens, the Biden administration has chosen to prioritize the interests of illegal immigrants, providing them with sanctuary and support at the expense of taxpayers,"" Gooden wrote.

""Covenant House and other federally funded NGOs must provide accountability and allow oversight from Congress. Failure to do so will result in swift action in the form of subpoenas.""

Gooden's letter does not indicate when Ibarra allegedly used the Covenant House address in New York. It is not uncommon for migrants who first arrive in the U.S. to list a shelter as their place of residence.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

FIRST ON FOX: A bicameral coalition of more than 130 Republican lawmakers penned a letter to the White House on Thursday, urging it to withdraw proposed tailpipe emissions regulations, forcing a transition to electric vehicles (EV).

The Republicans — led by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho — argued that the regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are a ""de facto EV mandate"" phaseout of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. They addressed the letter to President Biden and Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, which is expected to soon finalize the regulations.

""President Biden has made his intentions clear,"" Feenstra said in a statement. ""He would rather force American families — who are already facing financial hardship under the weight of inflation spurred by trillions in wasteful government spending — to buy electric vehicles to advance his Green New Deal agenda than allow folks to choose the best car or truck for their families, businesses, and farms at an affordable price.""

""This misguided decision also strengthens China while weakening our economy because the critical materials needed to manufacture electric vehicles are primarily sourced from China,"" the Iowa lawmaker added. ""Alongside Senator Mike Crapo, I’m proud to lead nearly 140 of my colleagues in urging President Biden to withdraw the proposed rule that would attempt to replace liquid fuels and combustion engines with unreliable and unaffordable electric vehicles.""

BIDEN ADMIN REPORTEDLY DOUBLING DOWN ON GAS CAR CRACKDOWN

Feenstra added that stories of Americans stranded in the cold waiting for their EV to charge during the winter provided further evidence that mandating EVs nationwide is ""ridiculous.""

Overall, under the proposal, which EPA unveiled in April 2023, the White House projected that 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases would be electric by 2032. In addition, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck, 35% of short-haul freight tractor and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could also be electric by then.

The White House said at the time that the tailpipe emissions proposal, which represents the most aggressive proposal of its kind ever proposed, would ""accelerate the clean vehicle transition"" and reduce oil imports by 20 billion barrels.

17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH

However, the proposal has faced widespread opposition from Republicans, as well as some Democrats and energy industry groups who say it will reduce consumer choice, lead to higher prices and benefit China, which dominates the EV battery supply chain. In December, the House voted 221-197, with five Democrats joining 216 Republicans, to pass a resolution nixing the EPA's proposal, but that bill has yet to receive a Senate vote.

""The reality is that most Americans still prefer the internal combustion engine vehicle, and EPA’s proposed rule unnecessarily restricts consumer choice and forces expensive EVs onto Americans at a time when they can least afford it,"" Feenstra, Crapo and the other Republicans wrote in their letter on Thursday.

""Major U.S. automakers have recently lowered their targets and pulled back planned investments in EVs due to low consumer demand and struggling EV units,"" they continued. ""Further, automobile dealers across the country have said EVs continue to sit unpurchased on dealership lots, despite automakers accepting massive losses and unsustainable government incentives.""

Late last year, thousands of auto dealers nationwide, including dealers in all 50 states and who collectively sell every major car brand, called on Biden to rescind the EPA proposal. They warned that, while some consumers are happy with EVs, demand is not keeping pace with supply and their lots are filling up with unwanted EVs.

VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE'

Further, the Republicans argued the Biden administration's proposal would make the U.S. more dependent on foreign supply chains, particularly those established in China. According to the International Energy Agency, China produces about 75% of all lithium-ion batteries and boasts 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% for anodes, two key parts of such batteries.

""Consequences of rules and regulations driven by the Biden Administration’s radical green agenda drastically reduce consumer choice and the affordability of vehicles available to Americans,"" said Crapo. ""Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable vehicles fueled by American-made energy products, not those primarily supplied by China.""

According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents several major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrid, up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.

At the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000.

In addition to Crapo, 23 other members of the Senate signed the letter, including Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Ranking Member John Barrasso, R-Wyo. Additionally, 113 House members signed the letter, including GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing JBS USA, the world's largest producer of beef, over the company's emissions and for ""greenwashing"" by allegedly misleading the public about its environmental impact.

In an announcement, James noted that beef production has the largest greenhouse gas footprint of any major food commodity and that animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. According to James, JBS USA's various net-zero pledges for 2030 and 2040 are therefore misleading and ""not feasible"" given the scope of its worldwide beef production operations.

""As families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis, they are willing to spend more of their hard-earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment,"" James said in a statement. ""When companies falsely advertise their commitment to sustainability, they are misleading consumers and endangering our planet.""

""JBS USA’s greenwashing exploits the pocketbooks of everyday Americans and the promise of a healthy planet for future generations,"" she added. ""My office will always ensure that companies do not abuse the environment and the trust of hardworking consumers for profit.""

GOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING UN FOR CALLING ON AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT

The lawsuit was applauded by state Democrats and national climate advocacy organizations like Earthjustice, Mighty Earth, Friends of the Earth US, Citizens Campaign for the Environment and Stand.earth.

""JBS repeatedly claims that it will reach net zero by 2040. This claim was found to be misleading and yet JBS continues to assert it,"" said Peter Lehner, an attorney at Earthjustice. ""While it is critical for every company to reduce its climate change impact, JBS would need to implement enormous operational changes to achieve this goal. However, JBS is doing very little and is not taking anywhere close to the steps that would be required.""

UN CLIMATE SUMMIT SERVING GOURMET BURGERS, BBQ AS IT CALLS FOR AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT

In her announcement and lawsuit, James pointed to several instances in which JBS USA and its executives made pledges to reduce the company's impact on the environment. She also stated the company — which has a market cap of more than $10 billion and whose North American beef business earns tens of billions of dollars annually — has acknowledged consumers are more interested in sustainable products.

For example, in March 2021, JBS announced a pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 across global operations and including indirect downstream emissions. The company then began a publicity campaign touting the pledge, running a full-page advertisement one month later in The New York Times stating ""it's possible"" for meat production to be ""part of the climate solution.""

Since then, JBS and its subsidiaries have continued to tout the 2040 pledge and other sustainability goals. The company even presented at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai late last year, announcing additional sustainability initiatives and investments.

TWO DOZEN REPUBLICANS CALL ON BIDEN TO DISAVOW JOHN KERRY'S REMARKS TARGETING FOOD PRODUCTION

""JBS takes its commitment to a more sustainable future for agriculture very seriously,"" JBS USA spokesperson Nikki Richardson said in an email to Fox News Digital. ""We disagree with the action taken today by the New York Attorney General’s office.""

""JBS will continue to partner with farmers, ranchers and our food system partners around the world to help feed a growing population while using fewer resources and reducing agriculture’s environmental impact,"" she continued. ""Our belief that American agriculture can help sustainably feed the world is undeterred.""

James' lawsuit comes as environmental groups and lawmakers worldwide increasingly set their sights on the agriculture industry. The global food system — which includes land-use change, actual agricultural production, packaging and waste management — generates about 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of 34% of total worldwide emissions, according to a 2021 study published in the Nature Food journal.

President Biden's international climate envoy John Kerry warned last year that decarbonization would be impossible without a concerted effort from the agriculture industry to achieve green goals.

""We can't get to net-zero, we don't get this job done unless agriculture is front and center as part of the solution. So all of us understand here the depths of this mission,"" Kerry said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Supreme Court expressed strong concerns on Monday about the sweep of state laws restricting how large social media companies moderate user content, a digital free speech case with implications in the political and business arenas.

Separate laws that passed in Florida and Texas and are now challenged in court would require Big Tech companies like X, formerly Twitter, and Facebook to host third-party communications but prevent those businesses from blocking or removing users' posts based on political viewpoints.

The regulations aim to address what some lawmakers call ""censoring"" of conservative messages, and banning politicians, like former President Trump, for violating subjective policies over offensive or ""problematic"" content.

But tech firms claim a First Amendment right as private entities to editorially regulate the billions of daily voices on their platforms — from political discourse and recipe sharing, to incitement and obscenity.

GOP AGS ASK SUPREME COURT TO PEEL BACK CONTENT MODERATION FROM BIG TECH IN LANDMARK FIRST AMENDMENT CASES

Justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum openly questioned whether the regulations would make it impossible for private companies to operate as a forum for free speech and expression.

""It covers almost everything,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor of Florida's law, which she said would affect what the arts and crafts retailer Etsy would have to allow on its digital marketplace. ""That's viewpoint discrimination. This falls under a whole lot of your listings and bans and disclosure requirements. Why are we imposing that on something like this?""

""The First Amendment restricts what the government can do,"" Chief Justice John Roberts told Texas' solicitor general. ""What the government’s doing here is saying 'you must do this, you must carry these people — you’ve got to explain if you don’t.' That’s not the First Amendment.""

But there was widespread unease about the best approach they should take at this stage.

Some justices suggested large companies that host wide-ranging speech platforms may be able to exercise greater editorial control, but that e-commerce sites like Etsy, Venmo, and Uber could be regulated by the states to some extent.

""This is a sprawling statute and it makes me a little bit nervous,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, over how a court opinion could be applied across the infinite variety of digital media. She said the competing interests ""had a bunch of landmines.""

Others on the bench wondered what the effect the big tech companies have on public discourse.

""There's a lot of new terminology bouncing around in these cases, and just out of curiosity — and one of them is content moderation,"" said Justice Samuel Alito. ""is it anything more a euphemism for censorship?""

JAN 6 RIOTERS, ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS: A LOOK AHEAD AT LANDMARK CASES SCOTUS WILL HEAR IN 2024

Alito also warned about resisting ""the Orwellian temptation to recategorize offensive conduct in seemingly bland terms.""

The Florida law would block a social media platform from engaging in censoring, prioritizing, or so-called ""shadow banning"" ""based on the content."" It also would prevent ""willfully deplatforming a candidate"" for public office for material posted by or about that candidate.

Both Florida and Texas would also require those companies to notify a user when their content has been modified or edited, along with an explanation for that action.

The states argue social media companies have outsized influence over what news and information the public sees, and say they have a long tradition of ensuring their citizens have full access to a range of viewpoints, calling social media platforms the new ""digital public square.""

The Florida and Texas laws were passed shortly after Twitter/X and Facebook separately removed Trump for their platforms, for his posts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots by his supporters.

Trump and a coalition of Republican-led states are among those filing separate amicus briefs supporting Florida and Texas

The Biden administration has opposed the state laws.

GOP SENATOR URGES SCOTUS TO REIN IN BIG TECH'S CONTENT CENSORSHIP THAT DEFIES 'LOGIC'

Trade groups representing big tech companies told the court the laws violate their free speech rights to decide what content meets their policies — saying their forums should not be an open-ended portal for offensive or dangerous speech — including school bullying, harassment, terrorist ideology, racial hatred, medical misinformation and voter fraud.

In almost four hours of oral arguments stretching well into the afternoon, the justices weighed whether to offer a sweeping ruling on the First Amendment implications of the state laws, or a more limited approach that might have the lower courts take another look at how those content moderation policies would be applied.

""Why isn't that a classic First Amendment violation for the state to come in and say, 'We're not going to allow you to enforce those sorts of restrictions?'"" asked Justice Elena Kagan.

""In your opening remarks,' Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked of Florida's Solicitor General Henry Whitaker, ""you said the design of the First Amendment is to prevent ‘suppression of speech.’ And you left out what I understand to be three key words in the First Amendment or to describe the First Amendment, 'by the government,'"" with Kavanaugh suggesting private companies should be given broader latitude to moderate their users content.

Attorneys for the states told the court that social media companies lack free speech protection since they only ""host"" viewpoints, similar to the telecommunications industry — known as ""common carriers"" — which transmits speech with no editorial oversight.

""Separating the wheat from the chaff here is pretty difficult,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch.

Justice Clarence Thomas, who light-heartedly noted he was the only member of the court who pre-dated the widespread use of the Internet was especially animated in his extensive bench remarks on the implications, asking tough questions of both sides.

""What do you do if it's a deep-learning algorithm which teaches itself and has very little human intervention?"" he asked at one point. ""So who's speaking then, the algorithm or the person?""

After the arguments, Florida Gov. Ron De Santis — on Twitter/X no less — said, ""We're gonna make sure we're doing everything we can to ensure people have a right to speak in these public forums. We want more speech, not less speech.""

These cases are just the latest in what is shaping up a busy term on the digital front at the Supreme Court.

The justices in March will hear an appeal from GOP-controlled states over whether federal government efforts to combat disinformation online violate the free speech rights of users on social media platforms.

Here too, those states say conservative political views are being silenced, after pressure on social media firms by the Biden administration.

And the justices have already heard arguments over whether public officials can block critical comments on their social media accounts from constituents.

Rulings in the cases argued Monday, Moody v. NetChoice, LLC and NetChoice, LLC v. Paxton, are expected by late June.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Former President Donald Trump claims that his wife Melania is expected to make more regular public appearances on the campaign trail.

Trump made the remarks during his interview at a Fox News townhall earlier this week with host Laura Ingraham.

""It’s funny, she was a very successful model, very, very successful, and yet she was a private person. She’s going to be out a lot. Not because she likes doing it, but she likes the results,"" he said Tuesday. ""She wants to see this country really succeed. She loves the country.""

TRUMP SAYS IT'S 'CRAZY' HOW CHRISTIANS, PEOPLE OF FAITH CAN VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS

""You know, a lot of first ladies would go out — they want to be everywhere. They get angry at their husband because he’s not introducing them,"" Trump continued. ""If I didn’t introduce Melania, she’d be very happy about it. She’s just a different kind of a person.""

Melania has been largely absent from her husband's 2024 presidential bid thus far, making few public appearances and staying out of the media.

Her absence, until recently, has been explained by the passing of her mother, Amalija Knavs, earlier this year. But as the campaign season becomes more intense, political commentators have questioned whether she will step back into efforts supporting Trump.

Trump also expressed appreciation that Melania has been dedicated to raising their son, Barron Trump.

""Her life revolves around that boy. It’s so important to her,"" Trump said. ""At the same time, it also revolves around our country and the success of our country. She’s raised a lot of money for charity. She’s a private person.""

""And she loves the country,"" Trump added. ""She’s going to be out a lot, but she does it for the good of the country, not for her. She’s somebody with a lot of confidence. She doesn’t need that.""

Trump's Fox News town hall came four days before South Carolina's Republican presidential primary, which commences Saturday.

The latest public opinion polls indicate that he maintains a very large double-digit lead over former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last major rival for the GOP nomination.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden told reporters on Wednesday that his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center went ""great,"" tamping down concerns over his health as the presidential election draws near.

Biden had just finished delivering remarks on how his administration’s policies on fighting crime in communities across the country are working when one reporter can be heard shouting if there’s anything Americans should know following his annual doctor’s visit.

""Well, they think I look too young,"" Biden replied.

Biden assured reporters that ""everything’s great"" regarding the check-up and that ""there is nothing different than last year.""

JACK SMITH RESPONDS TO BLISTERING HUR REPORT FOR FIRST TIME, SAYS BIDEN, TRUMP CASES NOT SIMILAR

Biden had revealed earlier Wednesday that he was making an unannounced trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a physical exam.

The exam comes after the report from Special Counsel Robert Hur that claimed the president had significant memory issues.

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, does not believe a cognitive test is necessary. She said O'Connor believes Biden proves his cognitive ability ""every day [in] how he operates and how he thinks.""

EX-OBAMA AIDES SAY AGE IS ‘VERY REAL ISSUE’ FOR BIDEN, WHO SOUNDS ‘FRAIL,’ ‘MUMBLY’

Biden received his last physical on Feb. 16 of last year, when his physician gave him a clean bill of health in a letter that said Biden was ""fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.""

Biden has undergone yearly physical examinations since the beginning of his term, in line with every other commander in chief since President Richard Nixon.

The Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the Global Times, touted President Biden and his campaign's use of TikTok, and critiqued the ""deep hypocrisy"" of America's politicians who call the social media platform a national security threat.

The opinion article in the CCP's state media said that Biden's campaign use of TikTok ""highlights the unjust suppression"" and ""proves the hype nonsense.""

""As a social media app that has been heavily portrayed by the US as a ‘national security threat,' TikTok being used by Biden's campaign highlights the unjust suppression of TikTok by American politicians and proves the hype nonsense,"" the article said.

BIG TECH FACES BRUTAL QUESTIONING ON CAPITOL HILL OVER CONTENT HARMING KIDS

The Global Times argued that the short-form video social media platform has become a ""necessary means"" for American politicians to reach young voters.

Citing a 2023 survey report by the Pew Research Center, the Global Times said that about one-third (32 percent) of young Americans aged 18 to 29 say they regularly get their news from TikTok.

The CCP newspaper said that American politicians are ""very self-contradictory when it comes to TikTok.""

The article argued that the Biden campaign's use of TikTok proves that the social media platform is not a national security threat and proves the ""deep hypocrisy"" of American politicians.

""In the end, we are witnessing that Washington's behavior toward TikTok is unacceptable to the public and society, so politicians have to choose to compromise for votes,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.

Jake Denton, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center, told Fox News Digital that Biden's ""hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats"" posed by TikTok.

President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America. — Jake Denton, Research Associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center

""Once again, President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America,"" Denton said. ""By choosing to use TikTok for his reelection campaign, he is callously disregarding warnings from both parties and national security experts that this Chinese-controlled technology imperils our national security through invasive data gathering and its ties to the CCP.""

""We cannot let one man’s thirst for social media virality and votes endanger our country,"" Denton said. ""The President must put America before his personal electoral interests, immediately delete TikTok, and join the bipartisan efforts to ban the app from operating on American soil.""

The Biden campaign's TikTok video sparked outrage after the administration banned the Chinese-owned app from federal devices over security concerns.

TIKTOK CEO GRILLED ON CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY INFLUENCE, SEARCHES OF TAYLOR SWIFT VS. TIANANMEN SQUARE

Last February, the administration set a 30-day deadline for government agencies to purge the app from federal devices.

The social media platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is popular among younger Americans.

Biden previously joined forces with TikTok influencers amid his re-election run, and the Democratic National Committee also joined the platform.

The president's campaign joining the Beijing-based social media platform could present unique security risks.

The Senate passed a stopgap measure Thursday night to avoid a government shutdown, which would have begun on Saturday, the first funding deadline for appropriations bills as laid out in the previous two-pronged spending bill.

Senators voted 77-13 to pass the continuing resolution, making the chamber aligned with the House. The bill now goes to President Biden to sign.

The continuing resolution passed the House earlier in the day, by a vote of 320-99. The bill moves funding deadlines to March 8 and March 22, rather than March 1 and March 8 initially agreed upon.

""We are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Wednesday, along with House Appropriations Committee Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine.

According to the lawmakers, six funding bills each for Agriculture-FDA, Commerce-Justice and Science, Energy and Water Development, Interior, Military Construction-VA, and Transportation-HUD will be taken up for votes and enacted ahead of the first deadline on March 8.

Negotiators are in agreement on the first six measures, which will be guided by both the Fiscal Responsibility Act discretionary spending limits, as well as the January topline spending agreement, per the statement. The deal laid out a $1.6 trillion topline amount for spending in the fiscal year, with $886 billion allotted for defense spending and $704 billion for non-defense purposes.

An additional slate of six bills, including those for Defense, Financial Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS, Legislative Branch, and State and Foreign Operations, are set to be agreed upon, taken up for votes, and signed into law ahead of the later March 22 deadline.

The latest continuing resolution is the fourth such extension since the Congress's failure to pass separate appropriations bills by the Sept. 30 deadline. It now heads to President Biden's desk for a signature to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.

EXCLUSIVE: Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican leader, is endorsing former President Trump for reelection.

It’s a key win for Trump from the establishment wing of the Republican Party. The South Dakota Republican is Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s top deputy in the Senate GOP.

""The primary results in South Carolina make clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president in this year’s pivotal presidential election. The choice before the American people is crystal clear: It’s Donald Trump or Joe Biden,"" Thune told Fox News Digital.

TRUMP MOVES CLOSER TO LOCKING UP GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WITH 20-POINT WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA

""I support former President Trump's campaign to win the presidency, and I intend to do everything I can to see that he has a Republican majority in the Senate working with him to restore American strength at home and abroad,"" he continued.

""Together we must put an end to the disastrous Biden-Schumer agenda. Our country cannot endure another four years of Bidenomics, continued lawlessness at our southern border, and American weakness on the global stage.""

Thune and Trump spoke by phone on Saturday night after Trump’s commanding victory in the South Carolina Republican primary, a source familiar with the call told Fox News Digital.

It wasn’t clear before now whether Thune, who’s seen as one of McConnell’s potential successors to lead the Senate Republican Conference, would endorse either of the two major candidates for the 2024 GOP nomination.

ONLY ON FOX: WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT HALEY AFTER TOPPING HER IN HER HOME STATE

Like McConnell, he suggested he would support whoever Republican voters chose as their presidential nominee, but Thune has for the most part avoided mentioning the former president.

He previously endorsed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott’s presidential campaign and was present at Scott’s launch event. Scott dropped out in November and endorsed Trump last month.

The Sunday announcement puts added pressure on McConnell, who has brushed off scrutiny on whether his frosty relationship with Trump would stop him from endorsing the ex-president in the Republican primary.

McConnell said at a press conference this month when asked about the race, ""I've stayed essentially out of it, and when I change my mind about that, I'll let you know.""

Both Thune and McConnell were targeted by Trump for criticizing his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and the 2020 election.

Thune won a landslide reelection victory for a fourth Senate term in 2022 despite Trump calling for a primary challenger against him.

His endorsement of the former president comes after Trump beat former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state primary on Saturday night. The ex-president won roughly 60% of the vote compared to 40% for Haley.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

FIRST ON FOX: A House Republican who has been critical of rushing to impeach President Biden is calling for his removal over questions about his mental fitness for the job.

Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told Fox News Digital that he plans to introduce a resolution on Monday to call on Biden’s Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution.

His most-cited reason was Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents. The report did not recommend any charges for the president but repeatedly painted him as an aging leader with a poor memory.

Buck said the report ""addressed what many Americans have long witnessed with their own eyes – that President Biden is no longer fit to successfully discharge the critical duties of his office.""

JAMES BIDEN SAYS HIS BROTHER 'HAS NEVER HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT' OR ANY 'FINANCIAL INTEREST' IN BUSINESS VENTURES

""Numerous instances were articulated in the report, and have played out in full public view, showing President Biden’s apparent cognitive decline and lack of mental stamina,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""The societal challenges and security threats our country faces are innumerable and require a chief executive with both strong mental and physical faculties. The time has come for the vice president and the Cabinet to put our country first and move forward on invoking the 25th Amendment.""

DEVON ARCHER: HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA EXECS ‘CALLED DC’ TO GET UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR FIRED

In his resolution text, Buck also cited Biden’s verbal stumbles and public gaffes as evidence of mental decline. It pointed out that Biden recently confused French President Emmanuel Macron with a predecessor who died decades prior, and that he also mixed up German leaders’ names and mistakenly referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico.

Biden and his allies have vigorously denied that his mental acuity is suffering.

But Buck’s resolution is a significant addition to the growing pressure for Biden officials to address scrutiny over the president’s mental fitness.

The Colorado Republican, who is retiring at the end of this term, is one of the few House GOP lawmakers who have publicly expressed wariness over the push to impeach Biden over allegations that he and his family’s businesses profited off of his political weight.

Buck voted along with the rest of the House GOP Conference to formalize the Biden impeachment inquiry in December, but just last week he criticized the probe’s leaders for relying on allegations made by FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who was recently indicted for lying to the bureau.

""We’ve always been looking for a link between what Hunter Biden received in terms of money and Joe Biden’s activities or Joe Biden receiving money. This clearly is not a credible link at this point,"" Buck said in a CNN interview.

He told the network in September, ""I want to make sure we don’t ruin this institution over a tit-for-tat impeachment. If the evidence is there… I will absolutely vote for impeachment. I don’t see the evidence at this point.""

Section 4 of the 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the White House Cabinet to declare the president unfit to perform his duties, transferring power to the vice president.

The president is able to take those powers back by writing to Congress that he is able to serve. The Cabinet would then have four days to refute that, after which Congress would vote on whether the president could remain in power.

Buck is one of several Republican lawmakers who have called for the constitutional amendment to be invoked in the wake of Hur's report, including Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, as well as Reps. Mary Miller, R-Ill., and Mike Collins, R-Ga.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment on Buck's resolution.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.

""This is a Joe Biden invasion,"" Trump said of the border crisis.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Colorado state legislature advanced a bill on Friday aimed at mandating K-12 schools statewide to implement policies requiring educators to address transgender students by their preferred name in all school settings – including in records and documents – independent of parental approval or a formal legal name change.

The bill will need one more round of voting before advancing to the Senate floor.

House Bill 1039 — a bill largely backed by the progressive group Colorado Youth Advisory Council — would also impact charter schools and mandates that educators use students' non-legal names in all school-related functions, including extracurricular activities, rosters, attendance lists, yearbooks and student ID cards.

In its proposal to lawmakers, the youth council said many ""school administrative systems cause humiliation for transgender Colorado youth when schools use the students’ deadnames (birth names that do not align with their gender identities).""

INDIANA PARENTS WARN NATION AFTER CHILD IS REMOVED FROM HOME FOR IMPROPER PRONOUN USAGE: ‘CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE’

""When schools keep a student’s former name and gender marker on school transcripts and records, it outs transgender students to their peers, thereby violating their privacy,"" the group wrote prior to the legislature's vote.

One Colorado, a progressive LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, also supports the bill, alongside the Colorado School Counselors Association.

The bill would also deem that ""intentional use of a name other than a student's chosen name is discriminatory.""

State Rep. Anthony Hartsook, a Republican, called the bill ""open-ended and ill-defined"" that could lead to ""many, many paths.""

""We open up Pandora's Box for discernment on what is discriminatory and what is not, what is intentional and what is not,"" Hatsook said on the House floor. ""Who starts deciding that when and where do we start deciding that? When and where do we bring the parents into that discussion?""

CAMPUS RELIGIOUS GROUPS REPORT GREATER INTEREST FROM STUDENTS TRYING TO FIND MEANING IN ‘CRUMBLING’ CULTURE

Republican State Rep. Brandi Bradley agreed with Hartsook and urged colleagues to vote ""no"" on the legislation.

""And now we have told the teachers that they're being discriminatory,"" Bradley said of the bill. ""I have four teenagers. They are awesome kids, but sometimes they like to play games. So tell me how codifying or putting this bill in is not going to go against teachers and their rights in a field where we already have so much shortage?""

Republican State Rep. Rose Pugliese added she does not want schools to know more about her kids than she does.

""Parents have the right to know,"" said Pugliese.

Other Republican lawmakers argued students would be allowed to change their names more than once, furthering burdening teachers to remember their new names.

Meanwhile, State Rep. Stephanie Vigil, a Colorado Springs Democrat co-sponsoring the bill, contended that some transgender kids who may not have come out to their parents yet would be in danger if the legislation is not approved. On the other hand, parents who support their transgender children would also have their parental rights usurped if they approve of the name change.

RESEARCHERS ARGUE ‘RAPID ONSET GENDER DYSPHORIA’ DOES EXIST, DESPITE NARRATIVE AGAINST IT

""And so I would just suggest to you all as we talk through this bill today that we bear in mind that there is such a thing as a kid who's not safe with their own parents,"" said Vigil. ""Certainly, kids belong with their parents – that relationship is precious. But I do not accept the premise that a child is anyone's property or that their safety isn't to be prioritized, even when the person who is a danger to them is their own parents.""

The bill was also sponsored by Democratic State Sens. Faith Winter, of Westminster, and Janice Marchman, of Loveland. State Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat and the legislature's only transgender member, is also a co-sponsor.

If cleared by the Senate and signed by the governor, the bill would go into effect in July 2025.

Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah are several states that have passed laws restricting pronoun use in schools.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Ahead of President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday, the White House debuted a new term for illegal immigrants arriving in the country, calling them ""newcomers.""

Biden will travel to Brownsville, Texas, in an effort to reassure voters who have soured on his handling of the border crisis. Republicans have lambasted the Biden administration for weak enforcement of immigration laws, and a recent poll showed that just 26% of Americans approved of the president's job on immigration.

The language the White House used to describe the crisis may not alleviate voters' concerns. In a fact sheet distributed by the White House press office to advocate for the bipartisan border agreement Biden has endorsed, officials pointed out that the bill includes $1.4 billion ""for cities and states who are providing critical services to newcomers.""

BIDEN'S BORDER VISIT LANDS ON ONE OF THE LEAST TRAFFICKED TOWNS, WHILE TRUMP IS HEADED INTO THE THICK OF IT

The reference to illegal immigrants as ""newcomers"" — which suggests equal status to migrants who come to the U.S. legally — provoked a swift condemnation from House Republicans.

""The Biden White House is now referring to illegal immigrants as ‘newcomers.’ Joe Biden is not serious about stopping the illegal immigration into the United States. This is a catastrophe by design,"" the House GOP conference posted on X.

White House officials have shot back at their GOP critics several times in recent weeks, asserting that if Republican lawmakers were serious about securing the border, they would support the bipartisan legislation President Biden has endorsed.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATIONS OF 36 STATES

The border bill negotiated in the Senate would increase Border Patrol staff and tighten asylum rules, expand law enforcement's authority to tackle fentanyl smuggling and increase funding to cities and states receiving asylum seekers.

Republicans argued the bill would normalize high levels of illegal immigration and do little to stop the flow of people and drugs over the border.

""We have done the work to make sure we're dealing with a broken immigration system. The Republicans have gotten in the way. They have gotten in the way,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday on CNN.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

""And so look, this is a serious matter, that‘s why the president is going to the border. The president was at the border a year ago in El Paso, visiting the border back in January 2023. He put a comprehensive, a comprehensive immigration policy on day one,"" she added.

Biden's choice of Brownsville for his border visit is an area that has seen comparatively small numbers of migrant crossings in Texas.

CBP data shows that Brownsville has seen just 46 migrant encounters over the past five days, compared to 2,106 in Eagle Pass. The former averaged 17 migrant encounters per day in February, while the latter averaged 462.

Brownsville is part of the CBP's Rio Grande Valley sector, which has seen 87,426 migrant encounters so far in FY 2024. The Del Rio sector that encompasses Eagle Pass has seen 182,077 encounters, but even that is far below the busiest sector, which lies around Tucson, Arizona, and has seen 297,380 encounters.

Former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, will visit Eagle Pass on Thursday in a competing visit, one of the most heavily trafficked areas in Texas and ground zero for Gov. Greg Abbott's fight with the Biden administration over enforcing immigration law.

Harris made the statement during a a recent interview last week before the Thursday release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on Biden's mishandling of classified documents, which described the president’s memory as having ""significant limitations.""

""I am ready to serve. There’s no question about that,"" Harris told The Wall Street Journal, adding that everyone who observes her work ""walks away fully aware of my capacity to lead.""

BIDEN CONSIDERED RESIGNING VICE PRESIDENCY ‘IN PROTEST’ OVER OBAMA'S AFGHANISTAN POLICY: HUR REPORT

Hur's report recommended no charges against Biden over his actions pertaining to the mishandling of classified documents, partly because he would have a defense at trial as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""

Republicans piled on Biden following the Hur report's release last week, but Democrats have also begun voicing — or at least admitting — greater concern surrounding Biden's age and whether that could hurt his chances at winning re-election this year.

Former President Bill Clinton's lead strategist, James Carville, argued Saturday that the White House has little confidence in Biden after he turned down a Super Bowl Sunday interview.

TREASURY CONFIRMS TERMS LIKE ‘MAGA,’ TRUMP,' KAMALA,' ‘BIDEN’ USED IN PRIVATE BANK TRANSACTION SEARCHES

""It’s the biggest television audience, not even close, and you get a chance to do a 20-25-minute interview on that day,"" Carville said. ""And you don’t do it? That’s a kind of sign that the staff, or yourself, doesn’t have much confidence in you. There’s no other way to read this.""

Another former Clinton strategist, Paul Begala, said Hur’s indictment of Biden’s memory and Biden's subsequent response was ""terrible for Democrats.""

""Oh yeah. Look, I’m a Biden supporter, and I slept like a baby last night: I woke up every two hours crying and wet the bed,"" Begala quipped on CNN last Friday. ""This is terrible for Democrats. And anybody with a functioning brain knows that,"" he declared.

The Biden administration finalized energy efficiency regulations targeting residential clothes washers and dryers in an effort to curb carbon emissions, as part of its broad climate agenda.

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced the final rules, which it projected will collectively save American households $2.2 billion per year on utility bills while reducing nearly 71 million metric tons of ""dangerous carbon dioxide emissions"" over the next three decades. DOE's regulations targeting the popular home appliances are slightly scaled down compared to the agency's draft proposal issued a year ago.

""For decades, DOE’s appliance standards actions for clothes washers and dryers have provided loads of savings for American families while also decreasing harmful carbon emissions,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.

""With strong support from industry leaders and consumer advocates, DOE will continue to roll out innovative appliance solutions throughout 2024 to lower costs for the American people — continuing the cycle of household savings that are the backbone of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,"" she continued.

BIDEN ADMIN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TARGETING HOME APPLIANCES WITH ECO REGULATIONS IN 2023

Under the regulations, certain less-efficient models of washers and dryers will be barred from being sold, according to DOE.

The clothes washers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 0.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 3% compared to the profile of models currently on the market. And the dryers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 2.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 11% compared to products on the market now.

BIDEN ADMIN BACKS OFF GAS STOVE CRACKDOWN AFTER WIDESPREAD PUSHBACK

DOE said the regulations largely reflect an agreement issued in September by environmental groups and industry associations.

""Standards at these levels will significantly reduce household energy bills and planet-warming emissions, period,"" Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said after the agreement was reached at the time.

""Swiftly establishing standards at these strong levels will allow the Department of Energy to continue to make progress with the highly successful efficiency standards program — which already saves the average household $500 annually on their energy bills,"" added Natural Resources Defense Council staff attorney Joe Vukovich.

BIDEN ADMIN'S WAR ON HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES WILL CAUSE HIGHER PRICES, DIRTIER CLOTHES AND DISHES, EXPERTS WARN

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) — which heavily criticized DOE's original proposal last year on washers and dryers — also signed onto the agreement. AHAM CEO Kelly Mariotti said in September that the compromise regulations would allow ""manufacturers to continue to offer a complete range of energy-efficient products.""

""What we're learning is that the government ought to get out of the business of doing these regulations,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""And not try to just float really extreme ones and then come up with something that's less extreme.""

""The main concern with these negotiated rulemakings is that it mostly involves the manufacturers and the energy efficiency activists,"" he added. ""One wonders how much the interests of consumers are taken into account during this process.""

The new standards for washers and dryers, meanwhile, are the latest in a long string of energy efficiency regulations unveiled by DOE over the last 12 months. Climate activists have argued such regulations are necessary to combat global warming, noting that the commercial and residential sector accounts for the largest share of total end-use carbon emissions of any sector in the U.S.

However, Republican lawmakers and free market advocates have argued the rules restrict consumer choice and lead to increased upfront costs.

""DOE should be looking for ways to address the problems caused by the existing washing machine regulations rather than making things worse with tougher new regulations,"" Lieberman told Fox News Digital.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Catch me at the border

President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday reflects his wishful thinking on the issue, arriving at one of the least-trafficked towns on the border.

Biden will visit Brownsville, Texas, which ranks as the 29th-most trafficked town by illegal border-crossers, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Former President Trump, meanwhile, is set to hold a competing visit to the border, though he will arrive at Eagle Pass, Texas, one of the most heavily-trafficked towns in the country.

Biden's trip to Texas is an attempt to address his deep unpopularity on the issue, with a recent poll showing just 26% of Americans support his handling of the border.

The White House says Biden will use the visit to renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing at the border as well as tightening asylum rules, moved to tackle fentanyl smuggling, and increased funding to communities and NGOs receiving migrants. Republicans argued it fell well short of what is necessary.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.

While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November.

Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says ""the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.""

""I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,"" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'

Smith’s ""primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,"" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, ""there might not be a trial.""

Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a ""host"" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as ""motivated"" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall.

Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.

HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Manual states, ""Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.

""Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,"" Turley said.

John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.



""If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,"" Shu said. ""It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.

""The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.""

""This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,"" Shu added.

On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, ""Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.""

But, Turley said, ""the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.""

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

""The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,"" Turley said.

""The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection.

""So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.""

Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said ""the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.""

""But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,"" Trusty said.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

A New York judge presiding over former President Donald Trump’s civil fraud case has denied his legal team’s request to avoid paying a $355 million penalty in the case.

Trump lawyers had asked Judge Arthur Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an ""orderly post-judgement process.""

In an email to the defendants posted Thursday to the court docket, Engoron said they had ""failed to explain, much less justify, any basis for a stay.""

""I am confident that the Appellate Division will protect your appellate rights,"" he wrote.

Last week, Trump was barred from operating his business in New York for three years and was found liable for $355 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

HAYLEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: ‘LET’S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

James said Monday she was prepared to seize Trump's assets if he is unable to pay the massive judgment handed down in his civil fraud case.

Trump could be at risk of losing some of his prized properties if he can't pay his staggering New York civil fraud penalty. With interest, he owes the state nearly $454 million — and the amount is going up $87,502 each day until he pays.

Engoron concluded that Trump lied for years about his wealth as he built the real estate empire that vaulted him to stardom and the White House. Trump denies wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal.

Trump's ability to pay his mounting legal debts is increasingly murky after back-to-back courtroom losses. In January, a jury ordered him to pay $83.3 million for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.

Trump claimed last year that he has about $400 million in cash — reserves that would get eaten up by his court penalties. The rest of his net worth, which he says is several billion dollars, is tied up in golf courses, skyscrapers, and other properties, along with investments and other holdings.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.""

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said.

Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.

SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY

Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.

NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,"" a spokesperson said. ""He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.""

Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.

GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered ""no"" when asked if ""undocumented immigrants"" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.

In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.

But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are ""inherently more unsafe.""

""It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.

""Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,"" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.

""But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,"" he said.

""And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,"" he said.

There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel will formally resign her position after the March 5 Super Tuesday primaries, weeks after former President Trump asked her to step down.

The announcement comes weeks after Trump revealed his recommendations for changes within the RNC earlier this month. He proposed that North Carolina GOP chair Michael Whatley take over as chairman, while his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita also receive leadership positions.

""It has been the honor and privilege of my life to serve the Republican National Committee for seven years as Chairwoman to elect Republicans and grow our Party,"" McDaniel said in a statement. ""I have decided to step aside at our Spring Training on March 8 in Houston to allow our nominee to select a Chair of their choosing. The RNC has historically undergone change once we have a nominee and it has always been my intention to honor that tradition.""

""I remain committed to winning back the White House and electing Republicans up and down the ballot in November,"" she added, before thanking her husband, family and RNC staff.

As he has moved closer to securing the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has been ramping up his calls for changes and new leadership at the GOP's national party committee.

TRUMP RECOMMENDS NORTH CAROLINA GOP CHAIR WHATLEY TO REPLACE MCDANIEL AT RNC: SOURCE

The former president met with McDaniel at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida in early February.

Trump wrote in his Truth Social platform following the meeting that McDaniel was a ""friend"" but that he would be urging changes at the RNC after the Feb. 24 South Carolina GOP presidential primary.

McDaniel was nominated by Trump soon after his presidential election victory in 2016, and she won re-election in 2019, 2021, and January of last year.

Gov. Kathy Hochul has called on online map and social media companies to stop listing unlicensed cannabis dispensaries.

Yelp said the company believes ""consumers have a First Amendment right to read and write about all businesses, even if unlicensed.""

After failing to wipe illegal cannabis dispensaries off the map, New York is asking online sites to hide them.

Since the state legalized marijuana in 2021, unlicensed pot shops have proliferated across New York City, with limited pushback from authorities. On Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul called on online map and social media companies to stop listing them.

""If you type in ‘cannabis dispensaries’ in Google Maps or Yelp, you’ll get a long list of unlicensed illegal vendors,"" Hochul, a Democrat, said Tuesday, speaking to reporters alongside some of the owners of licensed, legal weed stores that make up a tiny minority of the cannabis shops in New York City.

FEDERAL JUDGE GREEN LIGHTS NEW YORK MARIJUANA LICENSING DESPITE 'DISASTER' LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET ROLLOUT

In a statement, Yelp said the company believes ""consumers have a First Amendment right to read and write about all businesses, even if unlicensed.""

""Allowing users to contribute and see information ... about unlicensed businesses serves the public interest and provides a resource for regulators to determine whether any particular business has appropriate licenses,"" the statement read.

Legal marijuana shops in New York pay a vice tax, purchase from local farms, and submit to quality control testing to ensure their products aren’t laced with other drugs and aren’t stronger or weaker than their label says.

NEW YORK GOV. KATHY HOCHUL PROPOSES LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL POT SHOPS

But so far, fewer than 80 cannabis licensed stores have opened around the state, where strict eligibility requirements and lawsuits have contributed to slowing the rollout. Meanwhile, it’s common for a single neighborhood in New York City to have a dozen illegal ones.

Hochul vowed to crack down eight months ago, but has failed to make noticeable progress.

Aiming to avoid an echo of prohibition-era criminalization of drug sales, New York state’s marijuana legalization doesn’t include severe criminal punishment for illegal sales and doesn’t allow most law enforcement agencies to enforce pot laws.

Legislation that Hochul signed last May gave the state powers for inspections, seizures, fines that can reach $20,000 a day and, in some cases, close shops and go after landlords.

But the governor on Wednesday said she has since learned that it wasn't enough. She said the fines aren't high enough to deter people, and noted the appeals process takes many months, allowing shops to continue raking in tax-free profits off unlicensed products that are less expensive because they can be purchased out of state.

New York City itself has tried to stem the tide by going after landlords, but Mayor Eric Adams has been imploring Albany to grant the city more power to respond.

Hochul has asked the Democrat-controlled state Legislature to pass new legislation to grant more enforcement authority to city agencies, increase fines, and give law enforcement permission to shut down illegal stores before the appeals process plays out.

In the meantime, Hochul is asking tech companies ""to not be posting the sites that are illegal and ensure that they’re posting the legal shops.""

Local cannabis entrepreneur Osbert Orduña said Google Maps keeps delisting his legal shops, one in New Jersey, and another in Queens, New York. He said he’s never had trouble with his listings on Yelp, though he’d like the site to delist illegal operators as well.

NEW YORK LAWMAKERS CONSIDER ADDING POT SHOP CRACKDOWN TO OVERDUE BUDGET

""Four times, Google has taken us down off of their platform for ‘violating their terms of service.’ We’ve done nothing other than have our store hours and our basic business information listed,"" he said.

Google didn't immediately respond to a query about Orduña's specific circumstances, but noted in a statement responding to Hochul's comments that it does remove listings for closed venues.

""If we can confirm that a business has closed for any reason – including license issues – we’ll reflect that it’s closed in the listing. We also prohibit cannabis ads in New York and remove them upon detection, often before they ever run,"" the statement read.

Orduña said he also wants his illegal competitors, some of whom he knows personally, to be closed down. He says they tell him he's playing a ""sucker's game."" But as a former Marine, he likes to do things by the book and even plans on expanding to open another store in Queens next week.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

""This is an open primary,"" Haley emphasized in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview this week.

The former two-term Palmetto State governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in the former president's administration notes that ""anybody can vote in the primary, as long as you didn't vote in the Democrat primary on February 3rd in South Carolina.""

LIVE UPDATES: SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRIMARY

Trump is the 2024 GOP frontrunner as he bids a third straight time for the White House. He grabbed a majority of the votes last month in Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary victories and won by a landslide earlier this month in the Nevada and U.S. Virgin Island caucuses to close in on locking up the nomination.

HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL WIN THE NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: ‘LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

The final polls in South Carolina showed Trump maintaining a large double-digit lead over Haley, the last remaining major rival challenging the former president.

Independents helped fuel Haley's 43% showing in New Hampshire, where she lost to Trump by 11 points. But while independent voters have long played a crucial and influential role in the first-in-the-nation primary, they are much less of a factor in South Carolina's more conservative electorate, where evangelical voters enjoy prominence in GOP contests.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS ‘A**-KICKING' FOR HALEY IN HER HOME STATE, BUT SHE SAYS ‘I REFUSE TO QUIT’

A Monmouth University poll about South Carolina's primary conducted last weekend had Trump with a 72%-to-25% lead among Republicans questioned, similar to how he performed with GOP voters in New Hampshire. Haley, meanwhile, held a narrow 53%-46% advantage among independents.

The problem for Haley is nearly two-thirds of those sampled by the survey indicated they were Republicans, with only 28% identifying as independents.

Longtime South Carolina-based Republican consultant Dave Wilson, who remains neutral in the primary, noted ""there is no party registration in this state.""

""They're targeting what would be considered independent or swing voters. There's just not that many in South Carolina. You're either an R or a D in this state,"" Wilson said, addressing Haley's campaign efforts.

He added the Haley campaign and aligned groups are ""trying to find people who are so against Donald Trump that they're willing to step into a Republican booth and choose her name just to vote against Trump.""

Haley's allies are also making a pitch for Democrats who didn't cast a ballot in the party's relatively low turnout presidential primary earlier this month to vote in the GOP contest.

HALEY ACCUSES TRUMP OF SIDING WITH A DICTATOR AND TYRANT'

""If you did not vote in the February 3rd Democratic primary, you are eligible to vote on February 24th."" a mailer sent to Democratic voters by the Haley-aligned super PAC SFA Fund states.

""Your vote can make a difference,"" the mailer emphasized. ""Please participate by voting for Nikki Haley and make your voice heard.""

Haley has repeatedly vowed to march on regardless of her finish on Saturday. Michigan, on Tuesday, holds the next contest, and it's also an open primary.

In early March, nearly 800 delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday, and over 150 will be at stake over the ensuing two weeks. Among the states holding contests on Super Tuesday are delegate-rich California and Texas, and other big states like Florida, Illinois and Ohio will hold winner-take-all primaries March 19. Polling in many of those states indicates Trump holding large leads over Haley.

But Haley's campaign notes that 11 of the 16 Super Tuesday contests aren't limited to registered Republicans.

Campaign manager Betsy Ankeny in a recent memo highlighted that the upcoming open primaries contain ""significant fertile ground for Nikki.""

Trump and his allies have repeatedly blasted Haley over the courting of independents and even some Democrats.

""The Democrats are giving her money, and she's playing into the game. And I think she just can't get, she just can't get herself to get out. She is doing poorly in the polls. Look, if she was doing well, I'd understand it, but she's doing very poorly,"" Trump said Tuesday in a Fox News town hall in Greenville, South Carolina.

Haley, in an interview the next morning on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom,"" fired back.

TRUMP RUNNING MATE AUDITIONS ON THE SOUTH CAROLINA CAMPAIGN TRAIL

""He can keep saying I have big Democrat donors. At the same time, look at his disclosures. But I don't ask donors whether they're Republican, Democrat or independent,"" she said.

""We're fighting for the Republican primary, but there are a lot of independents who left the Republican Party because of Donald Trump. We are pulling them back. … We're pulling Reagan Democrats back. And Republicans need to remember this is not about pushing people out of our party. And that's why I do well with everybody, not just Republicans, not just independents.""

Seasoned Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams pointed out that ""it's up to each state to choose its process. … That's generally been a principle of states' rights that Republicans have long supported.""

Williams, a veteran of Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, noted that when Romney won the nomination a dozen years ago ""we were essentially the establishment and tried to draw in independents to offset what seemed to be a rotation of conservative challengers.

""We courted independent voters, and we had an eye on the general election too,"" Williams recalled. ""We wanted to make sure we were drawing independents to vote for us in the primary who would hopefully stick around for the general election.""

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News,"Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.

In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.

Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.

When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.

The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.

That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.

ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT

As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.

Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.

TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.

Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.

""We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,"" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. ""The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.""

The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.

The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.

Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.

""If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,"" Kim said.

Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.

""I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,"" she said. ""I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.""

She added: ""Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.""

REPUBLICAN HOPES

The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.

Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.

GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES

Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.

Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send ""ticked off"" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.

A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.

""We’ll come together,"" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. ""The threat from Republicans is too much.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.

The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a ""bump stock"" device is a ""machine gun"" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""

After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that ""bump stocks"" are machine guns.

The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.

GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several ""bump stocks"" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.

""It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,"" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.

But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.

The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.

""I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.""

Justice Samuel Alito called that ""disturbing.""

""These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.""

A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.

TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE

As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will ""bump"" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.

Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.

The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.

GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'

Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.

The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.

The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.

Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.

The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire ""automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""

Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.

""The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.""

After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, ""Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?""

But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.

""Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ""but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?""

The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.

""This is totally confusing,"" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.

""Now I'm completely lost,"" added Sotomayor at one point.

Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

""If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,"" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.

Supporters of the ban say it saves lives.

""Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,"" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. ""ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.""

A ruling is due by early summer.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The LAO laid out the grim forecast in a Tuesday report that cautions that a $24 billion ""erosion in revenues"" corresponds to a $15 billion increase in the state's budget problem. Due to this, the budget deficit, which last month was estimated to hit $58 billion, could now go as high as $73 billion.

""The actual increase in the state's budget problem will depend on a number of factors, including formula-driven spending changes, most notably Proposition 98 spending requirements for schools and community colleges,"" the report said.

H.D. Palmer, the deputy director of California's Department of Finance and Newsom's spokesperson on budget matters, responded to the new LAO report by telling Fox News Digital that their budget shortfall differs from the $38 billion they estimate.

""From now through April, more than $51 billion in income and corporate tax receipts are forecast to come in,"" Palmer said. ""No one can say today with certainty how those numbers may change the budget estimate of a $38 billion shortfall.""

""A responsible step would be for the Legislature to act now on the early action budget measures needed for $8 billion in solutions to help close this gap,"" he added.

The projected bad news comes as Newsom has worked to increase his profile nationwide. It also occurred as California experienced a mass exodus.

California saw its first-ever population decline in 2020 when the state imposed rigid lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 2020 to July 2022, the state lost well over half a million people, with the number of residents leaving surpassing those moving in by almost 700,000.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said she was ""proud"" to cast a protest vote against President Biden in Michigan's Democratic primary on Tuesday.

Tlaib's comments were shared in a video by Listen To Michigan, a group dedicated to getting Democrats in the Great Lakes State to vote ""uncommitted"" in the primary election.

Biden's stance on Israel's war in Gaza has earned him fierce backlash from Arab American and Muslim community leaders, particularly in Michigan, which is home to one of the largest Muslim communities in the U.S.

""Hi everyone, it's Rashida. I was proud today to walk in and pull a Democratic ballot and vote uncommitted. We must protect our democracy, we must make sure that our government is about us, about the people,"" Tlaib said. ""When 74% of Democrats in Michigan support a ceasefire yet President Biden is not hearing us, this is the way we can use our democracy to say listen.""

TRUMP SAYS SOUTH CAROLINA IS 'BIGGER WIN THAN WE ANTICIPATED,' LOOKS FORWARD TO SAYING 'JOE, YOU'RE FIRED'

""Listen to the families right now that have been directly impacted, but also listen to majority of Americans that are saying enough. No more wars, no more using our dollars to fund a genocide. No more. So please, take your family members, use our democratic process to speak up about your core values, where you want to see our country go.""

Tlaib said it was the first time her 18-year-old son had voted in an election.

Progressive-led campaigns and lawmakers have hammered Biden's re-election campaign over the U.S.'s handling of the Middle East conflict.

In addition to Listen To Michigan, a group called Abandon Biden has been pushing voters to actively oppose the president for his failure to call for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza.

TRUMP 'REALLY NOT THINKING ABOUT' HALEY AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA VICTORY, SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON BEATING BIDEN

Abandon Biden is specifically targeting voters in swing states, which could prove critical in the 2024 race that is likely to pit Biden against his old political foe, former President Trump.

Tlaib has been among Biden's most vocal left-wing critics in Congress in the wake of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants launched a surprise invasion in southern Israel, killing over 1,000 people and taking dozens more hostage.

Israel has responded with heavy bombardment and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters, has said nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in the resulting conflict.

Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, has spent the last day urging Michiganders on social media to also protest Biden in the Democratic primary.

She wrote in one post on her Instagram Story, ""We attend marches and protests all the time! We can stand at a polling station for EVERY CHILD KILLED in Gaza. Don't stay home. Help the uncommitted campaign.""

Gun Owners Of America came out swinging against Senator John Cornyn, R-TX, after he entered the race to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Aidan Johnston, Gun Owners Of America’s (GOA) Federal Affairs Director, said tCornyn has failed to stand firm on conservative values and has instead, compromised with Democrats on gun control bills.

""Every time gun control gains steam in Congress, Senator John Cornyn is right there working with Democrats on a 'compromise.' That isn't conservative leadership, it's capitulation!,"" Johnston said.

CROWDED FIELD OF POTENTIAL MCCONNELL SUCCESSORS EMERGES IN SENATE

The GOA said that Sen. Cornyn's record on gun rights makes him ""wholly unfit"" to become the Senate minority leader.

""In the eyes of gun owners and all those who treasure our liberties, the traitor from Texas' record makes him wholly unfit to lead Republicans in the Senate,"" Johnston said.

The conservative gun rights group said Cornyn has helped pass a series of bills that are ""gross infringements"" on the Second Amendment.

The GOA pointed to Cornyn over the Safer Communities Act, which he cosponsored with Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy in 2022.

The bill incentivizes states to pass extreme risk protection laws, also called ""red flag"" laws, that allow members of the public and law enforcement to petition the courts for a civil order to temporarily suspend a person's access to firearms for fear that person might do violence.

MITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER

After gun rights advocates raised Second Amendment concerns, Congress included requirements that states applying for federal grants to implement red flag laws include certain due process protections.

""Sen. Cornyn is responsible for helping pass the so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that, among other things, bribes states to enact 'red-flag' gun confiscation laws, creates a national de facto wait period for young adults to buy a gun, and creates a backdoor ATF rule to eliminate the private sale of firearms,"" Johnston said. ""These are gross infringements on the Second Amendment.""

""The best thing Senator Cornyn could do for gun rights is join Mitch McConnell in retirement,"" he said.

Another conservative group, the National Association for Gun Rights, also came out against Cornyn's bid to replace McConnell.

""Cornyn is the most anti-gun Republican in Congress,"" said Dudley Brown, President of the National Association for Gun Rights. ""His sponsorship of ‘Fix NICS’ and proud role in passing the largest gun control bill in decades (Biden’s so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act) is repulsive to law-abiding gun owners.""



""When the most anti-gun President in history calls an anti-gun Republican ‘rational’ that should set off alarm bells in every law-abiding gun owners’ head,"" Brown added.

The gun groups' statements on Sen. Cornyn came after McConnell, 82, announced Wednesday that he plans to step away from leadership after becoming the longest-serving party leader in Senate history.

""I am asking my Republican colleagues to give me the opportunity to succeed Leader McConnell,"" said Cornyn, 72, in a statement released Thursday.

In the developing pool of potential successors, Cornyn is frequently mentioned as one of the ""three Johns"" likely to next lead the conference. The other two are Sens. John Thune, R-S.D. and John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Sen. Cornyn's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Former President Trump will win the Michigan Republican Primary Tuesday night, winning yet another early contest and additional delegates — bringing him one step closer to being able to formally secure the GOP nomination.

The Associated Press projected Trump will win the primary shortly after polls closed Tuesday night.

With the Michigan win, Trump has claimed victory in every primary and caucus of the 2024 GOP presidential primary cycle.

Trump, who will likely secure the GOP nomination by next week after the Super Tuesday primary contests, dominated the Iowa caucuses, left New Hampshire with a commanding victory, swept caucuses in Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, won South Carolina with a ""bigger win"" than he anticipated.

MICHIGAN PRIMARY PUTS MAJOR BATTLEGROUND STATE IN PLAY FOR 2024

Trump needs 1,215 delegates to formally secure the nomination.

Both Republican and Democratic voters in Michigan hit the polls Tuesday to cast their ballots in the state-run primaries.

Republican voters on Tuesday had their choice from Trump, the clear frontrunner, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — the only two GOP candidates in the race — and others who have since dropped out, including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

JAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER 'UNCOMMITTED' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: 'HUGE PROBLEM'

There are 16 delegates at stake.

Trump called into the Michigan GOP Watch Party Tuesday night shortly after the race was called in his favor.

""I just want to thank everybody. This was a great day,"" Trump said, pointing to the state's autoworkers, saying Democrats ""destroyed the autowork business,"" but vowed to ""bring it all back into Michigan"" if elected.

""I just want to thank everybody…the numbers are far greater than we even anticipated,"" he said, adding that he will ""be doing a lot of campaigning over the next couple of months.""

""I can tell you this November cannot come fast enough,"" Trump said. ""We have the worst president in history--the most incompetent and the most corrupt president, and we can't let this continue.""

""So that day, November 5th, and January 20th is when we take over,"" Trump said, referring to Election Day and Inauguration Day. ""We're going to make America great again, greater than ever before.""

Democratic voters also had their chance to vote in the primary, casting ballots for President Biden or his Democratic challengers, Rep. Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson. Those voters also had the option to cast an ""uncommitted"" vote.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

It is almost too early to truly understand and divine where the votes might for someone to succeed retiring Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

The reason? The universe and conditions under which Republican senators will vote next fall to pick their new leader haven’t formed yet. Yes, take a look at the three Johns: Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), former Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). Even someone like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) could be in play. A source tells FOX is interested in the race.

GOP WON’T TAP MCCONNELL'S SUCCESSOR UNTIL NOVEMBER

But beyond that, we don’t know much.

Here’s why:

We have to first know who wins the presidential election. And if 2024 is anything like 2020, we might not definitively know until week or more after the election. A delay in figuring out the winner could delay the internal secret leadership election which Senate Republicans will take in mid to late November. But the winner of the presidential election will dictate who the GOP wants – especially if former President Trump prevails and has much to say about it.

Ironically, FOX is told that the antipathy between the former President and McConnell was not a major factor in the decision-making of the Kentucky Republican to step down.

MITCH MCCONNELL SENDS 'SHOCKWAVES' THROUGH SENATE WITH SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT

Another factor: who has control of the Senate – and by how many seats. Keep in mind we didn’t know until January 2021 as to which party would control the Senate in the last Congress.

This is why other figures may emerge. Especially dark horses.

As I have written before, leadership elections in Congress are not ""partisan politics"" They are ""particle politics."" The person who is propelled into leadership is not always the obvious choice: Think former House Speakers John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Or even current House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

WHY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS' IMPEACHMENT TRIAL MAY BE ON 'HIATUS'

FOX is told that some Senate Republicans are tired of what one senior Senate GOP leadership source termed a ""weekly MAGA show"" by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), JD Vance (R-Ohio) and others at the weekly Senate Republican Conference meetings. So if former President Trump loses and if the GOP doesn’t have control of the Senate, that could dictate who Republicans pick.

However, if Republicans prevail with a substantial majority, look at Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) as a possibility. He leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP’s campaign arm. Daines has made many of the right moves so far in GOP contests. If Republicans win the Senate by a good margin, some members (especially the new ones), might be willing to give Daines a look – if he’s interested.

The same factor could undercut Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). It’s not clear if Scott is interested. He ran unsuccessfully against McConnell in the fall of 2022. Scott led the GOP’s campaign efforts in 2022 – and Republicans failed to win the Senate. That could be an albatross for Scott and potentially inhibit him from making another run at leadership.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A top House Republican lawmaker is changing his mind about retirement after urging from former President Donald Trump.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., said on Thursday that he is reversing course on his decision to not run for a fourth term.

""While my strong desire was to leave Congress at the end of this year, since my announcement, I have received countless calls from constituents, colleagues, and President Trump urging me to reconsider,"" Green said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""I will be running for re-election so I can be here on Day 1 next year to help President Trump end this border crisis once and for all.""

TRUMP WINS THE MICHIGAN GOP PRIMARY, BRINGING HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO SECURING REPUBLICAN NOMINATION

His announcement came shortly after Trump urged Green to reconsider in a post on his Truth Social account. The former president said he would endorse Green if he ran.

""Mark Green has had lots of options because of his political talents, and the great job he has done as a Congressman, but given the fantastic work he’s doing as Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I hope he runs for Re-Election to the U.S. House of Representatives. If he does, he has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"" Trump wrote.

In addition to running for his own re-election, Trump is throwing his influence into House and Senate races across the country with various endorsements and behind-the-scenes maneuvering.

TRUMP HOLDS LARGE DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD OVER HALEY AHEAD OF CRUCIAL SHOWDOWN

He met recently with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ campaign arm.

Their sit-down at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, earlier this month primarily involved discussions about the 2024 election cycle and how to keep and expand Johnson’s razor-thin two-seat House majority.

As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Green has played a leading role in the House’s impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

He told Fox News Digital last week that his role has been ""challenging, rewarding and meaningful.""

EXCLUSIVE: A New York City police officer who was attacked by migrants in Times Square is coming to Washington, D.C., to watch President Biden tout his administration’s work over the last year in his State of the Union address.

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only Republican representing New York City in the House, told Fox News Digital she invited NYPD Lieutenant Ben Kurian to the president’s major address on Wednesday.

""Our NYPD officers are on the front line every single day working to keep our streets safe, and unfortunately, now they are being forced to deal with hundreds of violent crimes being committed by those in our country illegally,"" Malliotakis said.

ICE OFFICIAL RIPS NYC POLICIES SHIELDING POLICE-BEATING MIGRANTS FROM DEPORTATION

""The horrifying video of Lt. Kurian and his fellow officer being attacked by a mob in Times Square was hard to watch, but it shed a light on just how difficult our officers’ jobs have become.""

She said his presence at Biden’s speech will ""bring attention to the need for the Biden administration to end its dangerous border policies.""

A now-viral video from late January showed two officers being attacked by a group of migrants in the heart of New York City’s tourist area.

NYPD CHIEF BLASTS MIGRANTS' ATTACK ON OFFICERS AS MUGSHOTS OF SUSPECTS RELEASED

One suspect can be seen kicking an officer in the head twice while another person kicked the other officer in the back.

The attack began after the police officers asked migrants who were blocking the sidewalk outside a shelter to disperse, the NYPD has said.

The incident was a flashpoint in the tension that’s long been simmering in New York City since it was flooded by thousands of migrants, many seeking asylum. A number were bussed up by Southern governors whose states were buckling under the strain of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

More than 161,000 migrants have come to New York City in need of shelter and other city resources since the middle of 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said.

AMERICANS AREN’T SAFE WITH BIDEN'S OPEN BORDER AND THE SYSTEM IS ‘FLASHING RED’

Earlier this week, Adams, a Democrat, called for curtailing the city’s ""sanctuary"" status to allow migrants ""suspected of serious crimes"" to be turned over to federal law enforcement.

Republican lawmakers, including Malliotakis, have denounced the city’s sanctuary policies as a primary driver of the migrant crisis.

When reached for comment on Malliotakis' speech invitation, the White House referred Fox News Digital to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre's earlier condemnation of the attack.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.

Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.

Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.

Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.

The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.

The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was ""no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.""

Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.

Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.

Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.

""I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,"" Austin said at the time. ""I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden said Monday a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is close and hoped to see one materialize by ""the end of the weekend.""

The seemingly casual comments, carrying massive geopolitical significance, came during the president’s stop at an ice cream parlor near Peacock Network’s headquarters, where he had just wrapped up an interview with Seth Meyers on the ""Late Night"" show.

Asked by a reporter when he expected the ceasefire to begin, Biden, with a mint ice cream cone in hand, said he hoped by at least ""the end of the weekend.""

""At least, my national security advisor tells me that we’re close. We’re close. It’s not done yet,"" Biden said. ""And my hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a ceasefire.""

Biden also spoke about his planned trip to the southern border this Thursday where he will meet with border agents and discuss the need for bipartisan legislation.

Biden joked that ""my good friend"" would be making a border stop as well, a subtle nod to GOP rival, former President Trump, who is traveling to the border as well.

Biden's visit comes after the murder of Augusta University student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus in Athens last week allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant. Her murder has reinvigorated calls for Biden to take more stringent border measures.

The stop in Van Leeuwen came after a taped interview with Meyers, where dozens of pro-Palestinian activists were arrested for demonstrating in the lobby.

Negotiations are underway for a weekslong cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to allow for the release of hostages being held in Gaza by the Iranian-backed terrorist group in return for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The proposed six-week pause in fighting would also include allowing hundreds of trucks to deliver desperately needed aid into Gaza every day.

FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans have introduced legislation that would allow states to secure the border by constructing temporary border barriers along the southern and northern borders to stop the entry of illegal immigrants.

Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., is introducing the CONTAINER Act in the House – a bill that aims to give states the authority to build temporary barriers on federal land in an effort to stop illegal immigrants and drugs like fentanyl from entering into their states via the U.S.-Mexico border.

The bill is in response to legal battles that hit both Arizona and Texas over their efforts to secure the border with new barriers after border wall construction largely stopped when President Donald Trump left office.

BIDEN, DURING VISIT TO OVERWHELMED BORDER, URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK SENATE BILL: ‘TIME TO ACT'

In 2022, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, set up hundreds of double-stacked shipping containers across the border in an effort to stop illegal immigrants as numbers rose in his state. In 2023, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott installed wrecking-ball-sized buoys and razor wire along the Rio Grande as part of his Operation Lone Star.

Arizona’s barrier has since been removed. In December, a judge ordered Texas to remove its buoys in the Rio Grande, and a court battle between Texas and the Biden administration is ongoing after Texas sued the federal government for cutting the wire.

""Not only has the Biden Administration failed to enforce our laws and secure our border, but they have also barred border states from executing more robust border security measures,"" Rouzer said in a statement. ""No community is immune to the drugs, sex trafficking and crime these policies are incentivizing while enriching the cartels. This bill will give border states the explicit ability to erect physical barriers to protect not only their citizens, but all of America, from President Biden’s catastrophic open-border policies.""

Co-sponsors on the bill include House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R–Texas, and Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas.

""States like my home in Texas have the right to secure their borders when the White House refuses to do so,"" Pfluger said.

Companion legislation was previously introduced in the Senate by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who said last month that ""it’s clear Congress must act to give border states the explicit authority to protect their communities and the sovereignty of the United States.""

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Republicans have repeatedly called for border barrier construction as one of the ways to help secure the southern border. The House Republican border legislation, which passed the chamber last year, would restart border wall construction. However, it has not yet been taken up in the upper chamber.

The Biden administration has largely ended border wall construction, calling it ineffective. Some construction has continued where money has already been appropriated by Congress in previous fiscal years. It has also called for Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate border bill that does include some funding for border wall construction. But conservatives have warned that the legislation would normalize already-high levels of illegal immigration.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter Monday ahead of the government funding deadline later this week urging Republicans to reauthorize the federal radiation compensation policy.

The policy, known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), is on track to expire this spring. It was originally enacted in 1990 to compensate Americans exposed to radiation during the Manhattan Project and Cold War testing. While RECA has compensated many, there are still people awaiting claims, and certain affected groups have been overlooked, Hawley said.

""It is our duty to reauthorize and update RECA this spring. I emphasize that this is not a welfare program. It is a matter of basic justice for those the government poisoned,"" Hawley wrote in the letter. ""We’ve developed the most advanced nuclear weapons on earth, but we cannot forget the working people of this country who were sacrificed for it.""

BIDEN CALLS JOHNSON, SCHUMER FOR WHITE HOUSE MEETING AMID CONGRESSIONAL CHAOS STIRRING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FEARS

Hawley, a skeptic of additional funding to Ukraine, added, ""If we can send hundreds of billions of dollars in security assistance to foreign nations, we can spend a fraction of that on our own constituents who deserve help.""

Studies show that radiation from decades of mining, processing and enriching continues to permeate sites used during World War II and the Cold War.

In the 1940s, the U.S. was ramping up its military production to prepare for WWII, which included the government converting farmlands in Weldon Springs, Mo. into the Weldon Spring Chemical Plant. The plant produced a massive amount of TNT and DNT explosives for the war effort.

For Hawley, the issue hits close to home. In his home state of Missouri, nuclear waste was reportedly mishandled at one processing site, with leaky barrels left in the open air and contaminating a nearby creek where children have played for years. Hawley says in the letter many of those children have since developed cancer.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

""Tens of thousands of other Americans were exposed to radiation 'downwind' from over 100 atmospheric tests in western States,"" Hawley wrote. ""In most cases, nobody was warned of this danger. In others, the government simply lied. Repeatedly.""

But this could slow up the legislative process to approve government funding at the end of the week, as the upper chamber scrambles to pass full-year appropriations bills that would fund several federal agencies. The current temporary spending patch, known as a Continuing Resolution (CR), expires Friday and Congress will have to pass legislation by then to avert a partial government shutdown. The Senate has not introduced spending agreements yet for the remaining nine bills.

Hawley’s office told Fox News Digital it will seek to attach the RECA reauthorization to any legislative proposal that is likely to get signed into law.

This isn't the first time Hawley has tried to increase RECA's reauthorization chances by attaching it to any legislative vehicle that has a chance of passing. Last year, the Senate initially amended the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to include Hawley's RECA amendment, but it was later removed right before the package passed. Hawley's office has speculated it was removed due to cost.

Last year, some Republicans opposed a similar bill by Hawley that included RECA, arguing it would cost $100 billion over the course of a decade. Hawley proceeded to revise that portion of the bill and slashed the multi-billion dollar price tag, but his colleagues were still not convinced.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has opposed the proposal to reauthorize RECA, citing a commitment to shrink the federal deficit.

The Border Patrol union issued a fiery warning on Thursday to President Biden, telling him to ""keep our name out of your mouth,"" hours before the president is due to meet with officials at the border and urge passage of a Senate border bill.

Biden and former President Donald Trump are both heading to the border, with Biden visiting Brownsville, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders.

""During his trip, the President will receive a briefing on border security operations and an operational briefing from CBP, ICE, and USCIS. Afterwards, the President will deliver remarks to emphasize the need for Congressional Republicans to stop putting politics ahead of our border security and pass the bipartisan border security agreement,"" a White House official said.

BORDER PATROL UNION SLAMS BIDEN BORDER VISIT AS ‘TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE’ JUST TO ‘TRY TO SAVE HIMSELF’

That bipartisan bill, which includes additional staffing for Border Patrol and other agencies, as well as funding for cities and states receiving migrants and limits on asylum, won the backing of the union. Conservative lawmakers, however, rejected the bill and said it would normalize unacceptably high levels of illegal immigration and the bill has not progressed.

While it backed the bipartisan bill that Biden also supports, the National Border Patrol Council has otherwise been intensely critical of the Biden administration’s handling of the border crisis and put that in no uncertain terms in a post on X.

""Attention President Biden: Keep our name out of your mouth today,"" it said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on the post.

The union had issued a statement this week, calling the visit ""too little, too late.""

DUELING BIDEN, TRUMP VISITS TO BESIEGED BORDER COME AMID FRESH SLEW OF VIOLENT CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""But even if he were to put the proper policies in place at this late hour, he’d be doing it only to try to save his Presidency. And self-serving actions when time is winding down should always give Americans pause. Common sense dictates that as a lame duck, he’d revert to his open border policies if re-elected,"" the union said.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

""Biden is going to the border now solely to try to save himself. Border security should never be about politics, it should always be about the safety and security of this great nation and the American people,"" it said.

The trip comes as illegal immigration has become a top election issue, with polls showing a majority of voters see it as a critical threat to the country.

President Biden will seek to put the ball in the Republicans’ camp, repeating the administration’s argument that it is working within a ""broken"" system that needs funding and reforms from Congress. The White House has also pointed to a record of over 550,000 removals since May last year, more than any year since FY 23.

Fox News,"Welcome to Fox News’ Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.

What's Happening?

- Fani Willis' disqualification hearing happening Friday afternoon…

- DC voters make their presidential primary pick…

- Harris' shrinking role in migrant crisis

Where was the VP?

President Biden visited the southern border in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday, and was joined by a number of top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but Vice President Kamala Harris was not among them.

Biden spoke in Brownsville after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He urged Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that he believes will help solve the raging crisis at the southern border.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

But the vice president, who was tasked in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration, was not there.

A year ago, Harris announced an additional $950 million in response to the Call to Action, bringing in a total of more than $4.2 billion since May 2021. But since then, her public role only appears to have continually shrunk, even amid a historic year for illegal immigration, with more than 2.4 million migrant encounters in FY 23. FY 24 has been similarly overwhelming, with over 300,000 encounters in December.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

Biden spoke in Brownsville, Texas, after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He began by addressing recent wildfires in Texas and Oklahoma, and linking them to climate change.

BORDER PATROL UNION TELLS BIDEN TO ‘KEEP OUR NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH’ AHEAD OF TEXAS VISIT

The visit, which coincided with former President Donald Trump's visit to the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, comes as illegal immigration has become a major 2024 election issue and remains a thorny issue for the administration. Polls show that more than half of Americans think large numbers of illegal immigrants entering the U.S. represents a critical threat to the country.

The crisis, now into its third year, has smashed multiple records with more than 2.4 million encounters in FY 23 and over 300,000 in December alone — breaking the record for monthly encounters.

President Biden and his administration have sought to shift the blame for the crisis onto the shoulders of Republicans. The administration says that it is working with a broken system that needs significantly more funding and comprehensive immigration reform. It introduced a bill on Biden's first day in office that included a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants already in the U.S., which was immediately rejected by Republicans.

Republicans in the House introduced and passed legislation of their own that would fund more Border Patrol agents, resume wall construction, restart the Remain-in-Mexico policy and severely limit the ability of migrants to claim asylum.

After the White House made a supplemental funding request, including $20 billion for border funding in late 2023, Senate negotiators hashed out a deal that included additional staffing at the border and in asylum offices, an increased $1.4 billion in funding to cities and NGOs receiving migrants, took action to tackle fentanyl smuggling and would limit asylum claims. It would also increase detention beds to 50,000 and provide additional immigration judges.

DUELING BIDEN, TRUMP VISITS TO BESIEGED BORDER COME AMID FRESH SLEW OF VIOLENT CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""Folks, the bipartisan border security bill is a win for the American people and a win for the people of Texas, and it's fair for those who legitimately have a right to come here,"" Biden said.

""The U.S. Senate need to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits, not on whether it's going to benefit one party or another party,"" he said, also calling for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to put it on the floor in the House.

However, it has failed to gain enough support in the Senate, as conservative lawmakers have warned that a limiting mechanism that only comes into place after an average of 5,000 encounters a day would normalize already-high levels of illegal immigration.

Biden said, however, that it was ""the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.""

He also appealed to his predecessor to back the bill.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

""I understand my predecessor is in Eagle Pass today — here’s what I would say to Mr. Trump,"" Biden said. ""Join me, or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together.""

Republicans in the House, who have recently impeached DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, say Biden doesn’t need additional congressional action to secure the border and can do so with the tools his administration already has.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Speaking to Fox News Digital ahead of the speech, GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., dismissed Biden’s trip as a photo op, and called it ""another sign of Biden’s incompetence.""

""It's just going to be another cleaned up photo op. It's not going to be any actual confrontation of the crisis that this guy created. Time and time again, Joe Biden proves that he cares more about minimizing the political implications of this issue than actually addressing it. So I don't expect much is going to come out of it, except the American people are going to realize once again that Joe Biden doesn't really mean business when it comes to the border,"" he said.

Emmer said that to solve the crisis, Biden needs to tackle the five issues that were in the House GOP bill: end catch and release, reform parole authority, finish the wall, reform asylum and restore Remain-in-Mexico, which kept migrants in Mexico for the duration of their hearings.

Emmer, like others in the House GOP caucus, was dismissive of the contents of the Senate bill that Biden is promoting.

""You're going to make it law now that he can let in up to 5,000 a day before it becomes a shutdown situation? Outrageous. And the fact that anybody even reports it as an option, I think is less than responsible,"" he said. ""You’ve got to do something in the five areas that the House has already addressed, but the bare minimum is to restore Remain in Mexico.""

In the Senate, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., called the speech a ""half-hearted attempt to pay lip service to the crisis his policies have caused.""

""President Biden can fix this crisis, and I hope his visit is the wakeup call he needs to use the authority he already has to build the border wall, reinstate Title 42, and end catch-and-release, so that we can finally secure our border, uphold our national security, and keep Americans safe,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on President Biden to debate former President Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner, arguing that the president could ""beat"" Trump like he did in 2020.

""Biden beat Trump in the prior debates. I look forward to it,"" the California Democrat said during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.

The comment comes as Biden has so far refused to commit to debate Trump, who has a commanding lead in the Republican presidential primary race. Trump, on the other hand, has called on the president to debate him ""immediately,"" arguing such an event would be ""for the good of the country.""

'THE VIEW' HOSTS CLASH OVER WHETHER BIDEN SHOULD DEBATE TRUMP, WORRY PRESIDENT 'CAN LOSE'

Trump's desire to debate Biden comes despite his refusal to appear for debates against GOP primary foes, something Newsom argued Sunday was ""weakness masquerading as strength.""

""This is... pure projection on a guy who refused to debate in his own primary,"" Newsom said.

But not everyone believes Biden has much to gain by debating Trump ahead of this year's election, with the topic recently becoming the subject of a heated debate between the co-hosts of ""The View"" earlier this week.

BIDEN IS LYING LOW AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL AS COMMENTATORS WORRY THAT HE IS SEEN AS ‘NOT IN CONTROL’ OF THE NATION

Co-host Sara Haines had particularly strong feelings on the topic, warning that only Trump would benefit from the two candidates squaring off.

""Biden can lose, he can lose in a debate,"" Haines said. ""Trump will not. The people supporting Trump will support him whether he’s there or not. Biden makes one mistake, and the people who are undecided are out.""

Newsom's comments also come as speculation about his desire to jump into the race have continued to swirl, something the California governor said Sunday was off the table.

""I am here celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration,"" Newsom said, calling the continued speculation about his potential run ""idle chat"" and a ""sideshow.""

""It's not even an interesting conversation,"" Newsom continued. ""I think it's a damning conversation, frankly, the other side wants us to have… they love ginning this stuff up.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Minnesota's budget outlook has improved, officials said Thursday, with a slightly bigger surplus forecast for the current budget that will give the Legislature a little more breathing room this session.

Minnesota Management and Budget said the current two-year budget period, which runs through June 2025, is now expected to end with a surplus of just over $3.7 billion.

""The near-term economic outlook has improved, with growth expected to persist through 2027,"" the budget office said, citing higher tax collections. Corporate tax revenues are showing the largest gains due to higher-than-expected corporate profits.

The budget office is also forecasting a smaller potential deficit for the next two-year budget, which begins in July 2025.

Among those who are being floated as a potential replacement for the leadership position are senators John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; Rick Scott R-Fla.; Tom Cotton, R-Ark.; and Steve Daines, R-Mont.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced in a floor speech Wednesday he will step down from leadership in November. The Kentucky Republican is the Senate's longest-serving party leader in history.

Speculation about Thune, Barrasso or Daines taking over as leader stems from their current roles in GOP leadership. They serve as Republican whip, Senate Republican Conference chairman and National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, respectively.

MITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER

""Chairman Daines is laser-focused on taking back the Senate majority,"" NRSC communications director Mike Berg told Fox News Digital.

One source familiar with Senate Republican conference discussions shared that the ""three Johns"" — Thune, Cornyn and Barrasso — are not of the same political stripe. Barrasso is considered the most conservative out of the three, the source said. Barrasso is also believed to be a more palatable option for the various factions of Republicans in the Senate who don't always see eye to eye. He notably endorsed former President Trump early last month.

SEN. COTTON PROBES DOD HOW US AIRMAN WHO LIT HIMSELF ON FIRE WAS 'ALLOWED TO SERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY'

""What I'm focused on is the election,"" Barrasso told reporters shortly after McConnell's announcement.

As for decisions regarding leadership, he said, ""I'm going to talk to members of the conference, hear what they have to say, listen to them in terms of what direction that they want to take with us.""

Both Cornyn and Thune also endorsed Trump after Barrasso. Thune had initially endorsed fellow Sen. Tim Scott R-S.C., who ultimately dropped out and endorsed Trump.

Sen. Rick Scott was more pointed in his statement following McConnell's surprise announcement, saying in a statement, ""I have been very clear and have long believed that we need new leadership in the Senate that represents our voters and the issues we were sent here to fight for.""

When Scott challenged McConnell for the position, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told reporters McConnell received 37 votes from conference members, while Scott received 10. One Republican voted ""present."" Some of those who reportedly voted against McConnell were senators Josh Hawley, R-Mo; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Braun; Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who supported Scott in 2022, would welcome Scott's leadership if he were to take over, a staffer in Lee's office told Fox News Digital.

MCCONNELL SAYS SENATE TRIAL FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT IS THE 'BEST WAY FORWARD'

The source also shared that Cotton was being mentioned as a potential contender for the position. Cotton's office couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Cornyn, who does not hold a leadership position in the GOP and is poised to launch a potential bid for leader, said in a statement Wednesday that ""today is about Mitch McConnell.""

""But I've made no secret about my intentions,"" he added.

Cornyn on his timeline: ""Not today.""

Cornyn also endorsed former President Trump to be the Republican presidential nominee, and some lawmakers have begun looking to the likely GOP candidate for guidance about who should replace McConnell.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told reporters Wednesday the next person ""absolutely"" needs to have a more positive relationship with Trump, adding, ""He's going to be the next president, we have to work together.""

Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., agreed.

""It's so important that the next leader have a very positive relationship with the president,"" Marshall told Fox News Digital in an interview Wednesday. ""I think that this next leader needs to have a little bit more, maybe a lot more of a populist view.""

Marshall, who positioned himself alongside conservative hardliners who were critical of McConnell and voted against the bipartisan border deal in the national security supplemental package this month, added that the names being floated for leadership have been ""interviewing for the job since I got here.""

""I watch how they vote. I watch what their priorities are. I've been watching their volume on what issues they're championing,"" he said. ""All the names … have great qualities.

AFP Action, the conservative wing of the powerful and influential conservative Americans for Prosperity, funded by the billionaire Koch Brothers, has pulled funding for the presidential campaign of Nikki Haley.

In an email to staffers obtained by Fox News, AFP Action senior adviser Emily Seidel said the group did not believe that ""any outside group can make a material difference to widen [Haley’s] path to victory.""

""And so while we will continue to endorse her, we will focus our resources where we can make the difference. And that’s the U.S. Senate and House,"" Seidel wrote.

The news was first reported by Politico earlier Sunday.

AFP Action endorsed Haley in November, giving her a major grassroots and organizational boost.

The deep-pocketed fiscally conservative network launched an ad blitz on behalf of Haley in January, including mailers, digital ads, and connected TV spots.

AFP Action, which pledged to spend tens of millions of dollars to help push the Republican Party past former President Trump as it endorsed Haley in late November, said last month it was putting an initial $27 million behind this new wave in their ongoing campaign.

TOP HIGHLIGHTS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA'S GOP PRIMARY WHERE TRUMP WON BIG, HALEY VOWED TO PRESS ON

The news came after Haley’s GOP rival, former President Trump, won the GOP primary in Haley’s home state of South Carolina on Saturday.

Despite the loss, and defying calls to exit the race, Haley has said it’s not the ""end of our story"" as she traveled Sunday to Michigan ahead of the state’s primary on Tuesday.

In the less than 24 hours following her Saturday night loss, Haley's campaign said that she had raised $1 million ""from grassroots supporters alone,"" Fox News previously reported.

EUROPEAN NATIONS HAVE TO START PAYING UP: DONALD TRUMP

Haley's campaign argued that the money raised ""demonstrates Haley's staying power and her appeal to broad swaths of the American public.""

Asked Sunday about losing funding from AFP Action, Haley said she was ""not worried.""

""Americans for Prosperity was an amazing partner. They strongly believe in freedom. They believe in limited government. They believe in all the things that I, as a conservative, believe. And they've been fantastic through these states,"" Haley said, vowing to continue fighting ""for the 70% of Americans that don't want to see a Trump-Biden rematch.""

With his win Saturday in the first-in-the South contest, Trump has now swept every primary or caucus on the GOP early-season calendar that awards delegates. His performances have left little maneuvering room for Haley, his former U.N. ambassador.

The Border Patrol union mocked President Biden on Saturday for his trip to the Texas border this week.

""Board AF1, take nap. Wake up in place called Brownsville,"" the union wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in a joke itinerary of his day, along with a photo of Biden resting in a beach lounge chair. ""Read large teleprompter message, ‘It's all Trump's fault.’ Board AF1, ask who people in green uniforms were, told they ‘strap’ illegal aliens, express horror, take nap. Wake up, call a lid, hit beach, take nap.""

While in Brownsville on Thursday, Biden lamented that the bipartisan immigration bill failed to pass in the Senate, blaming Trump for using it as a political issue. Many Republicans have expressed their opposition to the bill, which they say doesn't do enough.

""The majority of Democrats and Republicans in both houses support this legislation,"" Biden said in Brownsville, ""until someone came along and said don't do that that'll benefit the incumbent. That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.""

The president faces increasing scrutiny over his handling of the border as the Border Patrol continues to report a record number of migrant encounters.

In December alone, there were more than 300,000 encounters – an all-time record.

The issue also threatens to hurt Biden politically ahead of November’s presidential election.

Trump was also at the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday which he said is ""being overrun by the Biden migrant crime,"" invoking the murder of Georgia student Laken Riley allegedly by a Venezuelan migrant last week.

BIDEN, TRUMP MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" Trump said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Biden and his administration have sought to shift the blame for the crisis onto the shoulders of Republicans. The administration says that it is working with a broken system that needs significantly more funding and comprehensive immigration reform. It introduced a bill on Biden's first day in office that included a mass amnesty for millions of migrants already in the U.S., which was immediately rejected by Republicans.

Republicans in the House introduced and passed legislation of their own that would fund more Border Patrol agents, resume wall construction, restart the Remain-in-Mexico policy and severely limit the ability of migrants to claim asylum.

The Border Patrol union frequently mocks the president over illegal immigration.

The organization wrote in part on X on Friday, ""Wasn't it Biden who encouraged people from all over the world to ‘surge the border’? Didn't Biden immediately void all the successful Trump EO's that were keeping our border under control? Didn't he publicly and viciously accuse BP agents of criminal assault, then told the world ‘those people will pay’, and the entire thing was made up BS? Has he apologized or taken responsibility for any of it, or asked forgiveness from the victims of some of the millions of illegal aliens he imported into this country?""

And before Biden went to the border, the group posted, ""Attention President Biden: Keep our name out of your mouth today.""

The murder of a Georgia nursing student allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested in New York City is the ""direct result"" of recent New York City laws that severed ties between the NYPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Republican Councilman Joe Borelli argued.

""It is a direct result of the City Council passing legislation that limits cooperation. If those laws were not enacted, the Department of Corrections would have given ICE the opportunity to issue a detainer against Jose Ibarra,"" Borelli told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week.

Georgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 22, was discovered beaten to death earlier this month after going for a run on the University of Georgia’s campus. The Augusta University student crossed paths with illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra, according to authorities, and died from blunt force trauma to the head.

Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was granted border ""parole,"" which allows noncitizens to temporarily enter the country due to an emergency or humanitarian reason, authorities have said. Ibarra soon made his way up to New York City, where he was arrested in August and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,"" according to ICE.

7.2M ILLEGALS ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

The NYPD, however, has said it does not have a record of Ibarra's arrest.

Typically, when ICE learns an illegal immigrant is arrested on criminal charges, the agency will issue a detainer that requests the local police department hold the suspect until ICE can take over and begin deportation proceedings.

In Ibarra’s case, ICE said he was released by the NYPD before a detainer could be issued.

New York City, however, is a ""sanctuary city"" with relatively recent laws passed by City Council severing many ties between the NYPD and ICE.

""A woman is dead in Georgia because the New York City Council passed local laws barring the NYPD from cooperating with ICE, and as such the suspect was released without any notification to federal law enforcement,"" Borelli tweeted this week, accompanied by a list of laws that restricted local cooperation with the immigration agency.

Under a pair of 2014 laws, the local Department of Corrections and NYPD were restricted from complying with ICE detainers under certain conditions. The DOC, for example, is only allowed to comply with an ICE detainer if it is accompanied by a warrant from a federal judge and if the suspect has been convicted of a violent crime in the last five years.

""Our city is not served when New Yorkers with strong ties in the community are afraid to engage with law enforcement because they fear deportation. Today, we send another message to Washington that the time to act has come to provide relief to so many individuals who contribute to our nation’s growth,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said when the two laws were enacted.

""I’d like to thank Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the City Council for passing this legislation, which further establishes New York City as a leader in immigration reform.""

Similar reforms continued under the de Blasio administration, including in 2017, when the City Council passed a bill prohibiting ""City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law.""

""The de Blasio Administration today announced the issuance of citywide guidance and new NYPD protocols to clarify and institutionalize the City’s policy that it will not voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities, and will only coordinate in limited circumstances, including where there is a public safety risk,"" a press release from the de Blasio administration stated of the law at the start of 2018.

Borelli, who has served on City Council representing portions of Staten Island since 2015, argued ""it's interesting to see people trying to backtrack on the impact that these laws have on the cooperation between ICE and city law enforcement.""

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""But the proof is in the pudding,"" he said.

The New York Republican pointed to comments made by local politicians when the laws were passed, arguing that Democrats wanted to sever communication between local law enforcement and federal authorities when involving illegal immigrants.

""The day we start helping ICE is the day we lose the public trust, which is why this guidance and protocol is so critical,"" a former NYC council member said in 2018, when de Blasio announced the prohibition of city agencies partnering with the Department of Homeland Security when related to immigration laws.

Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams also supported the measure in 2018, when he served as Brooklyn borough president.

""It is important for our police officers and City employees to have clear guidance and protocol on how to interact with federal immigration enforcement, especially considering the overaggressive behavior of ICE agents. Public safety for all of our residents must come first,"" Adams said, according to the de Blasio-era press release.

Following Laken Riley’s murder, Adams said this week that he supports altering city laws that would open the doors to New York City officials working with federal authorities on immigration matters involving violent suspects or repeat offenders.

""I want to go back to the standards of the previous mayors who I believe subscribed to my belief that people who are suspected of committing serious crimes in this city should be held accountable,"" Adams told reporters at City Hall Tuesday.

""We should not be allowing people who are repeatedly committing crimes to remain here, and we cannot collaborate with ICE in the process,"" the mayor added.

Adams has repeatedly spoken out in support of keeping New York City as a sanctuary city, saying illegal immigrants in the Big Apple should not live in fear of receiving city services, such as attending a school, due to their immigration status.

When asked about Borelli's comments and the laws passed by City Council under his administration, de Blasio told Fox News Digital in a statement that it's time for ""tougher border policies.""

""I trust the NYPD, and they say they never encountered the accused individual. But it’s sickening that a young, promising life was cut short. Any way you slice it, we need tougher border policies and comprehensive immigration reform,"" de Blasio said.

The former mayor also pointed Fox Digital to an opinion piece he wrote this month, in which he proposed accepting ""Republican demands for greater border security in exchange for full funding of a humane and functioning asylum process,"" along with ""spending billions to create the facilities necessary on the Mexican side of the border, including the concessions and incentives the Mexican government would require in order to accept this plan.""

Borelli argued the push by the City Council to sever ties with federal authorities back when de Blasio was in office evolved from Democrats in the city wanting to resist what they saw as a ""Trump agenda"" on immigration.

""This was a reaction by the de Blasio administration and the City Council to push back on what they saw as the Trump agenda. And as long as they were doing what they could to oppose Trump, they didn't care,"" he said.

Borelli said the local legislation is now backfiring as New Yorkers and others question the laws’ logic.

""It's completely backfired when people start to question, ‘What is the logic of having people who are here illegally in the first place, and then commit crimes against New Yorkers and others?’ There's limited rationale for keeping them here, even if you were a progressive who is sympathetic to people coming here in the first place,"" Borelli said.

Laken Riley’s murder has shocked many Americans and heightened outrage about the Biden administration’s border policies. More than 7 million illegal immigrants have flooded the nation since President Biden took office in 2021, a figure larger than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News Digital analysis previously found.

Riley was reportedly so badly beaten during the murder that her skull was disfigured, investigators reported in an affidavit.

""He’s a sick puppy,"" Borelli told Fox Digital when asked about the brutal attack. ""[He] would not have withstood screening, we hope, if we had a proper system of vetting and deporting people.""

Ibarra is in custody and was charged with the felonies of malice murder, murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and concealing the death of another, as well as the misdemeanor of physically hindering a 911 call, according to the affidavit filed Feb. 23.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER: MEDIA OUTLETS FOCUS ON LONE JOGGERS, DOWNPLAY SUSPECTED KILLER’S IMMIGRATION STATUS

New York State Senate Republicans on Wednesday announced the renaming of legislation that would allow local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE. The legislation will now be known as ""Laken's Law"" in memory of Riley.

""Because of New York law, because of New York sanctuary state laws, local law enforcement do not notify federal immigration officials when they take someone into custody, even if they're here — especially when they're here illegally,"" Republican New York state Sen. Robert Ortt said at a press conference Wednesday.

""So, Laken Riley's murderer, albeit an alleged murderer, was in custody, law enforcement custody, and he was released without notification to ICE, to federal authorities, because of policies and laws passed by Democrats here in New York State,""

Montgomery County officials met with ICE’s Baltimore Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to discuss cooperation on Tuesday. In a statement, county officials said there was a ""productive discussion"" between County Executive Marc Elrich and Baltimore Field Office Director Darius Reeves ""about improved communications and operational challenges with custody transfers."" An ICE official told Fox News Digital that a dialogue had been opened on honoring detainers and they were looking forward to a mutually beneficial arrangement.

ICE lodges detainers against illegal immigrants who are brought into local police custody when ICE believes them to be deportable. Those detainers request that the police notify ICE when they are about to be released and sometimes hold them for a limited additional time so that ICE can take them safely into federal custody and act to remove them.

However, ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions refuse to honor such detainers. Montgomery County claims it is not a sanctuary county, and that it works with ICE in their work on ""immigration and customs violations and drug and human trafficking."" Elrich said on a press call on Wednesday that the county does honor some detainers when an illegal immigrant is convicted of violent crimes.

Despite that claim, ICE says no detainers have been honored in the county in either the last fiscal year or this one. Director Reeves told Fox News Digital this week that in FY 2023, ICE issued 198 detainers, none of which were honored. So far in FY 2024, the agency has issued 119 detainers and none have been honored by the county.

He said those included illegal immigrants with convictions for assault, robbery, illegal firearm possession, sex abuse of a minor, rape and other sex offenses. He also said there was at least one MS-13 gang member among those whom ICE had requested, but they had been rebuffed by the county.

In the state of Maryland as a whole, the agency arrested 152 sex offenders in FY23. He said the counties that do not honor detainers – which he said includes Montgomery County – account for 46% of at-large sex offender arrests.

On Tuesday, ICE told Fox 5 that a Salvadoran national charged this week with the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland had been arrested twice in Montgomery County and released both times despite ICE lodging a detainer. Elrich said his initial arrests were for theft and were not on the list of violent crimes that would have resulted in him being turned over to ICE.

Reeves says ICE will go into the community and locate many of those illegal aliens, and brought them into custody, but stressed that releasing them onto the streets poses a threat to both ICE agents and the public.

""Any at-large operation like that, it's just an inherent risk and risk to the officer and risk to the subject of our arrest and it's a risk to normal day-to-day citizens that happen upon the scene,"" he said.

""The most violent of folks potentially have weapons on them. You can have incidents where… they take off in their vehicles and crash into other folks. It's just a whole host of issues that would not occur if the detainers were being honored. We could come to the jails and we can take them out of the jails in a safe environment and move them toward their immigration hearings.""

He also stressed that it is not a major burden on state and local jurisdictions.

""We're not asking any of these jurisdictions that are unwilling to cooperate to hold anyone for us beyond the 48 hours after their state release. What we are asking is to have advance notice of 48 hours so we can have the resources made available to pick up these individuals and in a very safe manner,"" he said.

In 2021, the Biden administration implemented significantly narrowed ICE enforcement priorities, limiting ICE to recent border crossers, national security threats and public safety threats. So Reeves stressed that the illegal immigrants they are typically targeting are normally serious criminals.

""We are focused on egregious offenders, major public safety threats and, national security threats. We are not focused on the single mother, migrant mother who happens to steal diapers or formula from the local bodega to feed her children. We are interested in guns. We're interested in sex trafficking, human trafficking, violence, rape, murderers, gangs. Those are the people that we're concentrating on.""

In its statement, the county said the meeting is one of a number of such meetings, and the two sides will be meeting again in the coming weeks.

""The County cleared up some misconceptions about our policy on immigration enforcement (ie Montgomery County is not a sanctuary county) and ICE underscored their need for more notice prior to releases,"" the statement said.

""Director Reeves offered resources and training for our Department of Corrections staff and the County shared our policy on notification to allow ICE to provide feedback,"" the statement said.

The meeting comes as ""sanctuary"" policies have come into focus after a number of high-profile crimes have been committed by illegal aliens after they have been previously arrested and then turned back onto the streets despite an ICE detainer lodged against them. In New York City, one of the most high-profile sanctuary cities, Mayor Eric Adams said this week that sanctuary laws need to be modified to turn migrants who have committed felonies over to ICE.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The first son is expected to take questions from lawmakers and congressional investigators behind closed doors before the House Oversight and Judiciary committees.

The deposition was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.

Hunter Biden's expected testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Tony Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

He added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

Also last week, congressional investigators heard testimony from a former business associate of Hunter's — Jason Galanis, who is serving a 14-year prison sentence. Galanis testified during a rare transcribed interview from an Alabama prison that Joe Biden was allegedly considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.

Joe Biden's involvement would bring ""political access in the United States and around the world,"" he claimed.

JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES

Hunter Biden was first subpoenaed to appear for a closed-door deposition in November. The deposition was slated for Dec. 13, but the first son defied the subpoena. Instead of appearing to testify, he held a press conference on Capitol Hill during which he defended himself and his father, saying the president ""was not financially involved in my business.""

Ahead of his subpoenaed deposition, Hunter Biden had offered to testify in a public setting.

Comer and Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, rejected his request, noting that the first son would not have special treatment and pointing to the dozens of other witnesses who have appeared as compelled for their interviews and depositions. Comer and Jordan vowed to release the transcript of Hunter Biden’s deposition.

But after he defied the subpoena, the committees in January passed resolutions to hold the first son in contempt of Congress for defying the congressional subpoena. Before those resolutions were able to be considered by the House Rules Committee and the full House, Hunter Biden’s attorneys offered to discuss scheduling a new deposition for the first son — something House Republicans were willing to do.

HUNTER BIDEN DEPOSITION SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH AFTER RISK OF BEING HELD IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS

The president’s son’s deposition comes after years of congressional investigations into his business dealings, beginning in September 2019 in the Senate. That investigation was led by senators Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis.

Hunter Biden’s business dealings and foreign relationships came under heightened scrutiny in the fall of 2019 during the first impeachment of former President Trump.

Trump was impeached after a July 2019 phone call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine, specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings and Joe Biden’s successful effort to have former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin ousted.

FLASHBACK: GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SHARE HUNTER BIDEN'S CHINA-LINKED BANK RECORDS WITH US ATTORNEY LEADING CRIMINAL PROBE

Hunter Biden was quietly under federal investigation, beginning in 2018, at the time of the call, a probe prompted by suspicious foreign transactions.

Trump's request was regarded by Democrats as a quid pro quo because millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen. Democrats also said Trump was meddling in the 2020 presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a Democratic political opponent.

Republicans had been investigating Hunter Biden’s business dealings, specifically with regard to Burisma Holdings. House Republicans, who were in the minority at the time, made several requests to subpoena Hunter Biden for testimony and documents related to the impeachment of Trump and his business dealings that fell at the center of the proceedings.

FLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE

Biden has acknowledged that when he was vice president he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, and Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board, receiving thousands of dollars per month. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion of critical U.S. aid at the time if Shokin was not fired.

""I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion.' … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,’"" Biden recalled telling then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Biden recalled the conversation during an event for the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

""Well, son of a b----, he got fired,"" Biden said during the event. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

Biden allies maintain he pushed for Shokin's firing when he was vice president due to concerns the Ukrainian prosecutor went easy on corruption, and they say that his firing, at the time, was the policy position of the U.S. and international community.

FLASHBACK: HUNTER BIDEN 'TAX AFFAIRS' UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION; LINKS TO CHINA FUNDS EMERGE, SOURCES SAY

Now, as part of the impeachment inquiry, Republicans are investigating any involvement Joe Biden had in his son’s business dealings.

Last year, the federal investigation into Hunter Biden that began in 2018 also came under heightened scrutiny when two IRS whistleblowers claimed politics were influencing prosecutorial decisions throughout the years-long probe.

Those allegations sparked congressional investigations and, ultimately, the impeachment inquiry. They also put pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to give then-U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware David Weiss special counsel authority.

WEISS SAYS HE 'WASN'T GRANTED' SPECIAL ATTORNEY AUTHORITY IN HUNTER BIDEN PROBE DESPITE REQUEST: TRANSCRIPT

Special counsel Weiss indicted the first son on federal gun charges in Delaware last year. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges. His attorneys are attempting to have that case dismissed.

Also last year, Weiss charged Biden with nine federal tax charges, which break down to three felonies and six misdemeanors for $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid.

Weiss charged Hunter Biden in December, alleging a ""four-year scheme"" in which the president's son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.

A group of Democrats who started a movement in opposition to President Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza sent a clear message in the Michigan primary, exceeding the amount of votes the group was aiming for and complicating the key battleground state ahead of this year's general election.

""Yesterday was a resounding victory,"" Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who joined the ""Listen to Michigan"" movement, said during a news conference Wednesday claiming victory for the movement.

The comments come following the movement's push to have Democratic voters select ""uncommitted"" in Tuesday's Democratic primary surpassed the group's expectations, with just over 101,000 people selecting the option, according to Associated Press numbers as of Wednesday afternoon. That mark was more than 10 times the group's stated goal, which was to get 10,000 people, or roughly the same as the margin of victory in the 2016 election in the state, to select the option.

POLL SHOWS BIDEN'S LEAD OVER TRUMP SHRINKING IN 2024 MATCHUP AS CONCERNS OVER PHYSICAL FITNESS GROW

Despite the apparent resounding success, Biden easily captured the state and gained 115 delegates while hauling in over 81% of the vote, further solidifying his grasp on the nomination and setting up a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in November.

""I want to thank every Michigander who made their voice heard today. Exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy is what makes America great,"" Biden said in a statement after the Michigan victory while warning that there is ""much left to do"" to defeat Trump in November. ""You’ve heard me say many times it’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of America. It’s never a good bet to bet against Michiganders either. This fight for our freedoms, for working families, and for Democracy is going to take all of us coming together. I know that we will.""

Meanwhile, Listen to Michigan supporters have warned they are willing to continue growing the movement ahead of the general election, a potential headache for the Biden campaign in a battleground state that has seen close margins in the last two presidential elections.

JAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER 'UNCOMMITTED' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: 'HUGE PROBLEM'

Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a Biden campaign spokesperson noted that the share of uncommitted votes, 11%, was actually in line with the previous time an incumbent was on the ballot in the state in a Democratic primary, which was during the 2012 re-election campaign of Former President Barack Obama. Nevertheless, the spokesperson stressed that the campaign is still working hard to earn the votes of holdouts and will continue working towards peace in Gaza.

But the movement started by Listen to Michigan may not be in Biden's rearview mirror after Michigan, with the group saying activists in future primary states have reached out about joining the cause.

""Two of the states where organizers have reached out specifically are Minnesota and Washington State,"" a Listen to Michigan spokesperson said during Wednesday's news conference. ""We have our eye on those states… and are ready to have conversations with anybody organizing for an anti-war future.""

The organization has also brushed off suggestions that it may at least indirectly help Trump regain the presidency, arguing that it is up to Biden to earn their votes.

""We are not electing Donald Trump. President Biden is the one seeking the highest office, and he is the candidate who's facing off against Donald Trump,"" Hammoud said.

Diego Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, was arrested last week and charged with green card fraud.

His younger brother, Jose, is charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another in the homicide of Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student.

Jose Ibarra is accused of killing Riley while she was jogging along a popular pedestrian loop around Lake Herrick on the University of Georgia's campus in Athens Feb. 22. The two brothers from Venezuela were living in the United States illegally. ICE confirmed Jose's illegal status earlier this week.

In a statement Thursday, ICE said Diego Ibarra had first entered the U.S. April 3, 2023, near Eagle Pass, Texas, but was removed via the COVID-era Title 42 process. He reentered April 30 and was enrolled into ""Alternatives to Detention,"" by which migrants are monitored via GPS tracking when released.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

He was released May 12, 2023, but by May 25 was judged to have bolted from the program after abnormalities with his GPS tracking device. Enrollees can be tracked in a number of ways, including a bracelet or a cell phone app. Last year, the administration pushed for a reduction in ICE detention beds and more funding for ATD but is now pushing for more detention beds.

The ICE statement said he has several arrests in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, but that ICE detainers — requests that ICE be notified when an illegal immigrant is being released for a transfer to ICE custody — were not honored.

The Athens-Clarke County Police Department told Fox News Digital it is not responsible for ICE notifications and does not have access to immigration status. It said that is instead handled by the Clarke County jail and directed Fox to the Clarke County Sheriff’s office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why the detainers were not honored.

The revelation comes a day after Athens Mayor Kelly Girtz repeatedly rejected the characterization Athens is a ""sanctuary"" city.

""There's been no legislation from this government that’s created sanctuary city status,"" he said.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Fox reported this week that Diego Ibarra was fired from the University of Georgia after it was discovered he presented a fake green card to work at the school's dining hall.

""Diego Ibarra presented a fake green card to the hiring unit to begin a temporary position as a dishwasher in Bolton Dining Hall at the University of Georgia on Feb. 6, 2024,"" UGA spokesperson Greg Trevor told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Diego then failed to ""submit further documentation required to keep the job and was never paid by the university"" before he was ""fired,"" Trevor added.

The White House on Wednesday issued a statement to Fox News Digital calling on local governments to work with ICE on deporting violent criminals.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities.

""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the southwest border. (The) 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013.""

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is urging the Department of Defense (DOD) to share information about the agency's contract with a Chinese-owned financial corporation that provides tutoring services for U.S. military families.

On Thursday, Cotton sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calling the business relationship with Hong Kong-based Primavera Capital Group ""ill advised, reckless,"" and a danger to U.S. national security.

Primavera, the capital group associated with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, owns the tutoring service Tutor.com and has provided critical funding to the TikTok giant.

""We should not be giving the Chinese communists access to the data of United States servicemembers and their families,"" Cotton, a member of the Senate's intelligence committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""I look forward to a full explanation from the Department of Defense on their continued use of Tutor.com.""

Like ByteDance and any other Chinese tech company, Primavera is subject to Chinese national security laws which require tech companies to release confidential business and customer data. Primavera acquired Tutor.com in January 2022.

""While providing educational services, Tutor.com collects personal data on users, such as location, internet protocol addresses, and contents of the tutoring sessions,"" Cotton wrote. ""As Chinese national security laws require companies to release confidential business and customer data to the Chinese government, we are paying to expose our military and their children’s private information to the Chinese Communist Party.""

Cotton also sought clarification on whether an internal review has been conducted to determine the continuation of the business relationship with Tutor.com, and if such a review has not taken place, an explanation is requested. Additionally, Cotton wants statistics on the annual usage of Tutor.com by military personnel or their dependents, and whether users are informed that their data may be shared with a Chinese company.

Cotton has previously called for a nationwide ban on TikTok, saying last month that the CEO is ""lying"" about the app being safe for users.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seeking to amend the city's sanctuary laws to exclude illegal migrants who have committed violent crimes.

Adams has mentioned his desire to tighten the city's regulations on illegal migrants multiple times this week, with his latest at a Tuesday press conference.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS DOUBLES DOWN ON CALL FOR CHANGES TO CITY'S 'SANCTUARY' STATUS AMID MIGRANTS CRISIS

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

This echoes the New York City mayor's previous remarks made during a Q&A session at an event on Monday.

""The overwhelming amount of migrants that are here, they want to work. I still don’t understand why the federal government’s not allowing them to work,"" Adams said Monday. ""They need to have the right to work like all of us that have come to this country had the ability to do so.""

MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS NEW YORK CITY HAS 'RUN OUT OF ROOM' FOR MIGRANTS: 'IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER'

""But those small numbers that are committing crimes, we need to modify the sanctuary city law that if you commit a felony, a violent act, we should be able to turn you over to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and have you deported.""

He added, ""It is a right to live in this city, and you should not be committing crimes in our city. Right now, we don’t have the authority to do so.""

Adams commended his administration on Monday for doing an excellent job during a challenging time, but he stated his hands are tied by federal and local law.

The mayor spoke about some migrants participating in robberies and using mopeds to commit snatch-and-grab stick-ups.

Adams has said before that migrants committing crimes should be handed over to ICE and deported.

Under the proposal from Republican Sen. John Polk of Hattiesburg, the board that governs the eight schools would choose three to close by June 30, 2028. The bill does not specify which institutions would close but says the board would make the decision based on enrollment, federal aid, tuition rates, degree programs and local economic impact.



MISSISSIPPI MAN GETS OVER 3 YEARS FOR RACIST, HOMICIDAL THREATS MADE ON SNAPCHAT

House Universities and Colleges Committee Chairman Donnie Scoggin, a Republican from Ellisville, said he had not studied Polk's bill, but a study committee to evaluate those metrics would be a necessary prerequisite.

""I am not for closing any of the colleges at this time without having a whole lot more knowledge,"" Scoggin told The Associated Press. ""I would not support that without knowing a whole lot more.""

Citing declining enrollment at several institutions, Polk has said the Legislature is appropriating too much money to keep the universities afloat. He declined to comment further on Wednesday.

Polk's proposal is not the first attempt to reduce the number of universities in Mississippi.

In 2009, then-Gov. Haley Barbour said Mississippi could not afford to keep all eight. Barbour, a Republican, proposed reducing the number to five by merging Mississippi University for Women into Mississippi State University and consolidating the three historically Black universities — Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi Valley State — into one school with Jackson State in charge. His proposal never gained traction because of widespread opposition from legislators and alumni groups.

Democratic Sen. Hillman Frazier of Jackson said Barbour’s failure showed there has never been a strong appetite for closing institutions in Mississippi. He also said the universities could reverse their enrollment declines with more state support.

""If you give the institutions the tools they need to attract students, that will address that,"" Frazier said. ""It sounds good politically, trying to be a fiscal conservative, but we need to give our universities the tools they need to be successful.""

Mississippi University for Women has attempted to recruit more students by switching to a name that doesn’t include the word ""Women."" But the university said last week that it was pausing that rebranding effort.

The eldest son of Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., was arrested Tuesday after several property thefts were reported in Rifle, Colorado, police said.

Tyler Jay Boebert, 18, faces five felony charges and more than a dozen misdemeanor offenses in connection to a recent string of vehicle trespass and property thefts, the Rifle Police Department said.

He is charged with four counts of criminal possession of ID documents belonging to multiple victims, one count of conspiracy to commit a felony and ""over 15 additional misdemeanor and petty offenses,"" the department stated.

""This is an ongoing investigation, no further information will be released at this time,"" Rifle police said, adding that all suspects are considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

REP. LAUREN BOEBERT'S EX-HUSBAND ARRESTED FOLLOWING ALTERCATION WITH CONGRESSWOMAN AT RESTAURANT

Online jail records show the teen is currently in the custody of the Garfield County Sheriff's Office. There is no bond information listed.

Reached for comment, Rep. Boebert said, ""I love my son Tyler, who has been through some very difficult, public challenges for a young man and the subject of attention that he didn't ask for.""

""It breaks my heart to see my child struggling and, in this situation, especially when he has been provided multiple opportunities to get his life on track,"" she said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""I will never give up on him and I will continue to be there for him. As an adult and father, Tyler will take responsibility for his actions and should be held accountable for poor decisions just like any other citizen.""

Boebert, 37, announced last year that her son Tyler, then-17, fathered a baby boy with his girlfriend, making her a grandmother.

Police were involved with Boebert's family earlier this year when officers received reports that the congresswoman was fighting with her ex-husband and Tyler's father, Jayson Boebert.

Jayson was arrested on Jan. 9 following the incident on charges of misdemeanor assault and criminal mischief. He was later released on bail from Garfield County Jail, according to the New York Post.

BOEBERT RESPONDS TO REPORTS OF FIGHT WITH EX-HUSBAND AT COLORADO RESTAURANT AFTER POLICE CALLED

A judge granted Boebert a temporary restraining order against her ex-husband earlier this month after she alleged Jayson threatened to harm her and himself.

In court papers, the lawmaker claimed her former spouse ""made multiple suicidal threats and threats to harm me over the past 14 months,"" according to the Denver Post.

Jayson told The Associated Press in an interview that he was the victim at the restaurant. ""I would never harm Lauren. I just want to move on and be in peace,"" he said.

He also accused his ex-wife of using the restraining order to ""justify"" her move to a new congressional district.

In her request, Boebert also cited a physical fight between her ex-husband and their 18-year-old son on Jan. 9. As Tyler called authorities, Jayson allegedly grabbed a rifle and left, according to court documents. Jayson was charged with harassment, prohibited use of a weapon and third-degree assault, court documents show. Boebert was not present during that altercation.

A Republican who has served two terms in the U.S. House representing the western side of the state, Boebert announced on Dec. 27 that she was switching congressional districts this year to run for a seat representing the eastern side of Colorado. The 4th Congressional District seat is open with the retirement of Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.

Six people were arrested Tuesday after police say they disrupted a city council meeting.

Officers were called to Seattle City Council chamber around 2:55 p.m. ""as people filled the room and continued to interfere with the session,"" police said in a news release.

The three men and three women were told to leave the chamber, but police say they refused and were told they would be arrested if they continued to interrupt. All six were charged with criminal trespass, and one of the men was also charged with obstruction.

Video of the meeting was posted on the city's Seattle Channel website, lasting just under two and a half hours. Two recesses were taken during that time, including one taken at the time police were called. It was supposed to last 15 minutes but went on for more than an hour.

Police say the city council meeting was able to resume after the arrests and many others left the chamber without any issues, but chanting and banging on windows could be heard when council members attempted to continue.

""Our physical safety is being threatened by the actions of the demonstrators outside banging on the windows, which could easily get broken, and we will have a mob scene,"" District 5 council member Cathy Moore said while asking for police assistance. ""I physically feel threatened.""

The protesters were referred to as ""progressive activists"" by local radio reporter Jason Rantz on the social media platform X. He said they were demanding that the city fund housing for refugees, even though ""they are not even being housed in Seattle currently.""

Many of them used the public comment portion of the meeting to talk about the issue.

""The issues of refugee housing and police surveillance are related,"" a woman named Lauren said. ""More money for police surveillance and ineffective and racist technologies like [‘Spothotter’] means less money for asylum seekers and other low-income people who desperately need housing.""

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday downplayed the notion that President Biden’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday was political and blamed Republicans for making the crisis worse.

President Biden and his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, are both scheduled to make dueling trips to the border on Thursday. Biden will visit Brownsville, while Trump will visit Eagle Pass, an area that has seen high levels of illegal crossings and has become a flashpoint in an ongoing battle between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the Biden administration.

Responding to a reporter’s question that Biden’s visit was merely in reaction to Trump’s visit – during an election year, no less – Jean-Pierre said the president’s schedule couldn’t just be upended on such short notice.

""[The president] has said that when Republicans rejected that Senate bipartisan bill on border security, on the immigration policy to fix a broken system that has been broken for decades, he said he was going to take it directly to the American people and also at the same time, hear from law enforcement and frontline personnel who deal with this issue every day,"" Jean-Pierre said.

President Biden, despite reversing many Trump-era border policies upon taking office, has repeatedly said his hands are tied on the border issue, saying the matter must be solved via legislation.

A bipartisan Biden-backed border security deal crafted by Senate negotiators amid an unprecedented surge in immigration collapsed in early February after Trump signaled his disapproval. That, in turn, has given the White House fodder to accuse Republicans of not taking the border issue seriously.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE, AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Jean-Pierre said Republicans, having rejected the deal, are ""getting in the way"" when it comes to fixing the border.

""This is not about politics for this president. This is about how we're going to fix an issue that the majority of Americans care about, a broken immigration system, the challenges at the border. That's why the president thought it was important to go at this time,"" Jean-Pierre said.

Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich noted that the administration has often criticized Republicans who go to the border to hold similar press conferences, writing them off as ""publicity stunts"" and ""photo ops.""

Jean-Pierre said Biden’s visit was ""very different,"" and repeated her assertion that Republicans ""constantly get in the way.""

""They consistently get in the way of what the president is trying to do to get more resources,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""They are turning this into a political stunt by listening to Donald Trump and saying that they need to kill it.""

On the suggestion that Biden just happened to be going to the border during an election year, despite it being a problem for the past three years, Jean-Pierre pointed to Biden’s ""comprehensive immigration policy"" implemented on day one of his presidency.

""He did that on the first day. That was his first piece of legislation. I would hope the American people would see how serious this president was or is about fixing this issue,"" she said.

MARYLAND COUNTY TO OPEN ICE COOPERATION AFTER PAST STONEWALLING, RELEASE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

After taking office, Biden signed two executive orders on immigration and pledged to roll back many of the policies put in place by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Within a few months, Biden took more than 90 actions related to the border.

Under the president’s stewardship, illegal immigration has skyrocketed to historic levels. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report for fiscal 2023 showed that the number of illegal immigrants on the non-detained docket soared from 3.7 million in FY 2021 to nearly 4.8 million in FY 2022 to nearly 6.2 million in FY 2023.

Thursday will mark Biden’s second visit to the border since taking office. The area he is visiting, the Rio Grande Valley, which includes Brownsville, gives Biden a platform where illegal crossings have dropped sharply.

The area is also a friendly congressional district that – as noted by Border Patrol Union President Brandon Judd – historically hasn’t seen much illegal traffic, in large part due to the infrastructure Trump provided while in office, and more recently due to the actions of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott since Biden took office.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

End of an Era

Longtime Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in an emotional speech in the Senate shortly after noon.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said. McConnell's first Senate term started in 1985, under the late President Reagan, and McConnell remained a huge fan (despite Reagan at first calling him ""Mitch O'Donnell -- Close enough""). But McConnell didn't reminisce much.

""There'll be plenty of time to express my gratitude and greater detail as I sprint towards the finish line, which is now in sight,"" he said.

McConnell's dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference after the November election, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, who said at a Fox News town hall recently: ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Yet after McConnell's announcement, gratitude poured in from both McConnell's allies and his critics. ""I’m grateful for his service.... I think Mitch's tenure has had many legacies. But no legacy is more consequential than the nomination and confirmation of hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary. And that is a lasting benefit to the American people for which I'm deeply grateful,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters.

McConnell said he intends to finish his current Senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

Oklahoma authorities are investigating a local high school after footage from a fundraiser event appeared to show students sucking and licking one another's toes last week.

The footage from Deer Creek High School in Edmond, Oklahoma, shocked and disgusted social media users across the country this weekend. Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters soon announced an investigation into the incident, calling it ""disgusting.""

The footage, originally obtained by Fox 25, was taken during a week-long fundraiser for a local coffee shop that employs people with special needs. Students from 9th through 12th grade volunteered to take part in various class competitions that students paid to attend, according to the outlet.

The video shows student volunteers who were paired up, one set sitting on chairs while the others laid down below them and licked peanut butter off of their toes.

""This is disgusting,"" Walters said in a statement on Friday. ""We are cleaning up this filth in Oklahoma schools. Our agency is investigating.""

Outrage librarian Libs of TikTok soon shared the footage on social media, demanding to know ""who approved this."" The account mistakenly claimed that the students were paired up with adults in the activity, however.

Reactions to the incident rolled in, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declaring ""this is child abuse.""

Walters then replied to Cruz' statement, saying ""Completely agree. We are stopping this in Oklahoma.""

Parents and students also reacted in statements to Fox 25. One parent who spoke with the outlet anonymously said

""It was surprising,"" one student told the outlet. ""I didn't think they were going to do all that. I was just shocked. I didn't really have like a feeling. I was kind of disgusted, and then kind of glad I wasn't over there.""

""Whenever she told me yesterday that was happening, I had to ask her, 'Wait, what? They're licking peanut butter off of toes? What?"" one parent said of a conversation with their student.

Meanwhile, the school celebrated the ""success"" of the fundraiser in a public statement.

""This afternoon, Deer Creek High School announced a grand total of $152,830.38 raised for Not Your Average Joe Coffee, an organization created to 'inspire our community by including students and adults with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities,"" school staff wrote.

""On Thursday, February 29, 2024, Deer Creek High School hosted an assembly called the Clash of Classes for students who paid to attend. During this assembly, ninth through twelfth grade students volunteered to participate in various student-organized class competitions, in the spirit of raising money for NYAJ. All participants in the assembly were students who signed up for the game(s) they played ahead of time. No Deer Creek faculty or staff participated in any of the games during this Clash of Classes assembly. Many dedicated students gave generously of their personal time to achieve this momentous accomplishment, which will serve communities beyond the boundaries of Deer Creek. We would like to thank all of the patrons, businesses and sponsors who contributed to the success of this year’s Wonderful Week of Fundraising,"" the statement continued.

The tax credit bill received bipartisan support, passing the chamber by a vote of 162-3. It provides a state income tax credit of up to $300 that could be used to pay for training and gun storage devices.

But Democrats decried the second bill banning the merchant code as a giveaway to the gun lobby that would make the state less safe.

STATE DEMS ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘BACKDOOR GUN TAX’ ON LAWFUL FIREARM OWNERS

Both bills now go to the state Senate for consideration.

Merchant category codes exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers. In 2022, Visa and other credit card companies said they would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, though they later put that decision on hold in the face of opposition from the gun lobby and conservative politicians.

There had been hope that categorizing credit and debit card purchases would allow authorities to potentially see red flags — like significant ammunition purchases — before a mass shooting could happen.

Republican state Rep. Jason Ridley, noting the ISO is based in Switzerland, said the code could be used to create a registry of gun sales.

""I don’t care which side of firearms you stand on,"" he said. ""Nobody should know what you’re buying and keeping a registry, especially a foreign country.""

Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state.

""She probably should drop out,"" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. ""I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.""

But Jodi said ""she should still stay in the race.""

""She's a better candidate than Trump,"" she added.

Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday.

""I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,"" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. ""I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.""

""I really don't know what she's doing,"" he continued. ""She's out of control.""

Similarly, Scott said, ""she needs to get out"" of the race. ""It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,"" he added.

KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT

Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman.

""She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do."" George said. ""If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.""

But Dan said he had ""no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.""

""She’s got no path to victory,"" he continued.

Theresa said: ""She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.""

Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination.

""I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.""

Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because ""we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.""

""I like Trump,"" he said. ""Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.""

But Josh said Haley's effort ""seems pointless.""

""It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,"" he told Fox News, ""which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden's predictions of a cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel are looking too sweet to be true, with multiple Hamas officials rejecting the current deal.

Biden predicted between licks of an ice cream cone on Monday that Hamas would accept a deal with Israel in the coming days, but statements from Hamas officials show little hope of progress.

""I hope by… the end of the weekend,"" Biden said Monday with cone in hand. ""My national security advisor tells me we’re close. We’re close. It’s not one yet. My hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a cease-fire.""

Meanwhile, multiple Hamas officials indicated on Tuesday and Wednesday that no breakthrough in negotiations had been made, according to The New York Times.

ISRAELI SECURITY EXPERTS SAY BIDEN’S PALESTINIAN STATE PUSH IS AN ’EXISTENTIAL THREAT’

""We are not interested in engaging with what’s been floated, because it does not fulfill our demands,"" Hamas official Ahmad Abdelhadi said in an interview with a Lebanese broadcaster.

BIDEN TO GO TO UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO FORCE TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE ON ISRAEL, HALT RAFAH OFFENSIVE

More concerning, Hamas spokesman Basem Naim said the terrorist organization had not even received ""any new proposals"" since the parties met last week.

Hamas is not the only party warning Biden to pump the brakes. Qatar, which has played a major role throughout the negotiations, indicated on Tuesday that there is no deadline for an agreement.

""The efforts are ongoing; all the parties are conducting regular meetings,"" Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters, according to NYT. ""But for now, while we certainly hope it will be achieved as soon as possible, we don’t have anything in our hands so as to comment on that deadline.""

Meanwhile, Israel is deep in the planning process for an expected invasion of Rafah, the Gaza town on the border with Egypt that plays host to both the final remnants of Hamas and key routes for aid.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an invasion would proceed at some point regardless of whether a cease-fire agreement is reached.

President Biden visited the southern border in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday, and was joined by a number of top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but Vice President Kamala Harris was not among them.

Biden spoke in Brownsville after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He urged Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that he believes will help solve the raging crisis at the southern border.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

BIDEN, DURING VISIT TO OVERWHELMED BORDER, URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK SENATE BILL: ‘TIME TO ACT’

But the vice president, who was tasked in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration, was not there.

The administration had initially leaned firmly into the root-causes narrative in early 2021, claiming that those causes – which include climate change, violence, poverty and economic insecurity – were driving migration to the U.S. border. Its answer, therefore, was to engage with governments and to invest in targeting those causes, eventually bringing migration down.

The assignment quickly led to Harris being dubbed the ""border czar"" – a title the White House rejected, stressing instead that it was more to do with international engagement. She would go on to visit the border in El Paso in June 2021 after facing pressure.

As part of that effort, Harris has been attempting to rally private-sector investment to the region via a Call to Action – particularly into the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

""First, I do believe most people don't want to leave home. They don't want to leave their grandmother. They don't want to leave the place where they worship and the community that they've always known,"" Harris said in 2022. ""And so, when they do, it is usually for one of two reasons: They are fleeing harm, or to stay means they simply cannot satisfy their basic needs or the needs of their family.""

A year ago, Harris announced an additional $950 million in response to the Call to Action, bringing in a total of more than $4.2 billion since May 2021.

But since then, her public role only appears to have continually shrunk, even amid a historic year for illegal immigration, with more than 2.4 million migrant encounters in FY 23. FY 24 has been similarly overwhelming, with over 300,000 encounters in December.

Harris was not part of the border tour on Thursday, nor was she part of a delegation to Mexico City in December with Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

In that meeting, the two countries, according to a White House readout, ""reaffirmed their existing commitments on fostering an orderly, humane, and regular migration.""

""This includes reinforcing our partnership to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, inequality, and violence, and for the two countries’ initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans,"" it said.

Yet, despite the discussions on root causes, Harris was not in attendance. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.

The L.A. Times recently reported that Harris will meet with new Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo in Washington to announce more private-sector investment.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

But root causes, while still on the agenda, have appeared to be less of a focus for the administration in its border strategy — in part because the migration surge has increasingly been coming from countries coming outside of the Northern Triangle, including from Venezuela, Nicaragua and China.

The administration is now focused on passing the Senate border bill, which has bipartisan support but has struggled to gain enough support to pass due to conservative opposition. The bill includes additional funding for staffing at the border, funding for cities and NGOs, as well as rules tightening asylum and a mechanism to shut down entries when they reach a certain level. Conservatives say it would codify an unnecessarily high level of illegal entries.

Harris has put out a statement calling for Congress to pass the bill earlier this month.

""Let us remember: we are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants have always helped strengthen our country, grow our economy, and drive innovation. We know that in America, diversity is our strength,"" she said. ""So rather than politicize this issue, let us all address it with the urgency and seriousness it requires.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Washington state Republican Chair Jim Walsh has called having voters write their party affiliation on the outside of their mail-in ballot a ""questionable design decision"" as some Washingtonians have raised concerns.

Walsh told Fox News Digital on Friday the requirement to declare one’s party is ""codified in law"" and is only for the primary, not the general election.

""The design where the attestation, the declaration is on the outer part of the envelope, that is not state law, that is a guideline, an administrative decision made by the Washington Secretary of State in conjunction with local county level election officials,"" he said.

Walsh added, ""That is not statutory, that’s just a questionable design decision by the Secretary of State working in conjunction with the local county elections people.""

Walsh said state Republicans have been trying since 2016 to change the law requiring voters to declare their party ""so that people can choose to be unaffiliated,"" but have been blocked by the Democrat-led legislature.

One X user snapped a photo of their ballot envelope, showing where voters must declare themselves as Democrats or Republicans, writing on Thursday, ""New Washington State envelopes for mail-in ballots. NEVER had to disclose my party declaration on the OUTSIDE of my ballot before. Don't feel really good about this.""

Cartoonist Scott Adams reposted it, writing, ""How can this be real?"" and X owner Elon Musk responded, ""What!?""

Another voter wrote, ""QUESTION- Why am I REQUIRED to list party affiliation on the outside of the envelope to VOTE?""

A third X user posted a picture of their envelope, writing, ""Washington State Presidential Primary Ballot … you have to declare on the outside of the envelope?!? Also no option for independents! This is how ballots get tossed before they can even be counted!""

""We’re not keen on the law, but we understand it is the law and that we do need to comply both with state law and with some national and with some national party rules,"" Walsh told Fox News Digital of the requirement to declare a party.

He said the ""spirit of the law"" is to keep voters from people from ""gaming the system, being part of one party and trying to vote in the other party’s primary"" but he felt there could be genuine security concerns with the declaration being on the outside of the ballot.

He told Seattle-area radio host Jason Rantz this week that he suggests voters take their ballot to a ballot box rather than mailing it in.

""Deliver it to a ballot box. Or give it to a trusted person to deliver,"" he said.

But Rantz noted in an opinion piece, that ""Fraud at the primary stage doesn’t make a whole lot of sense this election cycle. Donald Trump will be the nominee and it’s unlikely any other candidate would come close enough for stealth fraud to take place. And while fraud (and mistakes) obviously occur, there’s been no recent evidence of widespread fraud that would be enough to change national elections. But voters rightly remember the scandal around the recount between then-gubernatorial candidates Dino Rossi (R) and Christine Gregoire (D).""

The Washington Secretary of State’s Office has included examples of protests voters wrote on their ballots in 2016 — in showing voters the correct way to mark their ballot — that included statements such as, ""Actually I’m an Independent but if it makes you happy,"" ""Don’t tell me what I need to be … the voters are furious"" and ""I feel like I am being forced to choose a party and that’s not fair.""

The voter's party declaration choice is removed after 60 days, according to the secretary of state's office, noting on its website, for the ""Presidential Primary only, the major political parties require voters to mark and sign the party declaration. If you choose to participate, your choice of party will not affect how you may vote in future elections. You must mark and sign the political party declaration (box) on your envelope for your vote to count.""

The office has not clarified why the declaration is on the outside of the ballot. Fox News Digital has reached out to the secretary of state's office.

A New York state appeals court has denied an attempt by New York City leaders to implement a law that would let non-citizens vote in local elections.

In a 3-1 ruling issued Wednesday by the Appellate Division for the Second Judicial Department, the body said the law violated the New York Constitution and Municipal Home Rule Law.

It ""must be declared null and void,"" the court said in a 43-page ruling.

The law was passed in December 2021 by the City Council and created a class of ""municipal voters,"" comprising non-citizens who reside in the city for at least 30 days before an election and register or pre-register to vote. Municipal voters would be granted the right to participate in elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president and council member.

WISCONSIN'S GOP-LED LEGISLATURE MAKES SECOND ATTEMPT TO DRAW MAPS BEFORE SUPREME COURT DOES

The law faced legal challenges almost immediately.

It would have applied to some 800,000 new eligible voters in a city of 8.5 million. However, the appellate court said that the clause in the state constitution that says ""every citizen shall be entitled to vote…"" applies exclusively to U.S. citizens.

""As there is no reference to non-citizens, and thus, an irrefutable inference applies that non-citizens were intended to be excluded from those individuals entitled to vote in elections,"" the court said.

New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022. It was ruled illegal several months later. The mayor defended the law and appealed a lower ruling against it.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Adams' office and it was not clear if he would appeal Wednesday's ruling.

REPUBLICAN PARTY INFIGHTING ESCALATES IN OHIO AS MARCH PRIMARY NEARS

Many Democrats championed the law, saying it would make the city's politics more inclusive, while Republicans contended it could lead to voter fraud and that Democrats were only looking to pad their numbers.

""Great news! We won in the appellate court and @NYCMayor’s attempt to implement the law to register non-citizens to vote in #NYC elections has been struck down,"" U.S. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-New York, posted on X. ""This is a big victory in preserving both the integrity of our elections & the voice of American citizens!

Malliotakis, who represents New York's borough of Staten Island, was one of several plaintiffs to sue over the law, along with Borough President Vito Fossella.

""Fortunately, common sense prevails in New York, thanks to the decision reached by the Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department. The New York State Constitution is clear in that only citizens can vote in our local elections. It is simply irresponsible and nonsensical to extend this right to non-citizens. We are pleased that the Appellate court shared this understanding. This is a win for New York citizens and upholds the integrity of our elections,"" Fossella said.

The New York Immigration Coalition said it was disappointed in the ruling.

""For generations, New York City’s culture and economy have benefited from the immigrants who have come here to work, raise their families, uplift their communities and pay taxes in New York,"" NYIC Executive Director Murad Awawdeh said in a statement. ""While we are still reviewing the decision and its impact on immigrant New Yorkers, the lawsuit remains another shameful attempt by xenophobic Republicans who would disenfranchise residents rather than promote a more inclusive and participatory democracy. Immigrant New Yorkers deserve a say in how their local government functions and spends their tax money, and we remain committed to ensuring the expansion of voting rights.""

The ruling comes as New York City is grappling with a surge in migrants that has resulted in an uptick in crime and anger from residents. In December, Adams warned that the city was at its ""breaking point"" as city resources and shelter services had become strained.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

After coming into office in 2021, Biden regularly launched rhetorical bombs at Georgia and other states as being ""Jim Crow 2.0"" or ""Jim Eagle,"" for requiring voter ID for mail-in voting. However, Georgia allows three weeks of early voting.

Delaware Superior Court Judge Mark H. Conner ruled in a 25-page opinion, ""The enactments of the General Assembly challenged today are inconsistent with our Constitution and therefore cannot stand.""

Delaware’s constitution in Article 5 Section 1 states that a ""general election shall be held biennially on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November."" The Delaware early voting law, enacted in 2019, allows in-person voting up to 10 days before an election.

FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS DOJ PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE BLACK GEORGIA VOTERS WOULD BE HURT BY SHORTER EARLY VOTING

""The conflict between these two passages is obvious,"" the judge wrote. ""Our Constitution enumerates the one day an election shall be held biennially, and the Early Voting Statute allows for voting at least 10 days before that date.""

The Delaware Board of Elections argued that the words, ""election shall be held"" refers to the last day votes can be cast.

MICHIGAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION GIVES COMMUNITIES MORE TIME TO HANDLE ABSENTEE BALLOTS

The plaintiffs in the case were Delaware state Sen. Gerald Hocker, a Republican, and Delaware resident Michael Mennella, an inspector of elections for the Delaware Department of Elections. Mennella was represented by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a Northern Virginia-based election watchdog group.

""This shows that states have to follow their own constitutions,"" J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Fox News Digital.

He noted this comes days after a New York state appeals court ruled that New York City’s law to allow noncitizens to vote in municipal elections violated the state constitution.

When asked about Biden’s remarks toward other states such as Georgia, Adams said there was some irony.

""There is a little bit of irony, though he never served in the Delaware legislature that passed these laws,"" Adams said. ""But if he wants to talk about state voting, he might want to devote his energy to Delaware.""

Currently 46 states and the District of Columbia allow early in-person voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That tally includes Delaware, which could still appeal the decision.

Neither the Delaware Board of Elections nor the state attorney general’s office responded to inquiries from Fox News Digital for this story about whether there were plans to appeal. Adams said he was not aware of the state’s plans.

This marks Mennella and the legal foundation’s second victory over the state of Delaware in less than two years. In December 2022, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in Mennella’s favor when he challenged the constitutionality of the state’s universal vote-by-mail and same-day voter registration laws.

The lower court judge on Friday also determined a provision of the early voting law that allowed registered voters to get permanent absentee voting status was unconstitutional based on Article 5 Section 4A. This section was added to the state constitution in 1943 and specifies conditions when someone is ""unable to appear"" for in-person voting because a voter is away from home or is sick or disabled. This would also be determined on a per-election basis.

""By granting indefinite absentee voting to those who are unable to vote in a single election extends beyond the limited authority granted to the General Assembly by our Constitution,"" the judge ruled.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Trump and his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were barred earlier this month from operating their business in New York for a range of two to three years. Trump was also found liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

TRUMP BARRED FROM OPERATING BUSINESS, ORDERED TO PAY OVER $350 MILLION IN NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

The former president is appealing the ruling.

On Wednesday, though, a New York Appeals Court judge ruled that the former president must post a bond for the full amount of the judgment and the independent director of compliance will be appointed.

The judge will temporarily allow Trump and his sons to continue running the business as they appeal the decision.

The filing is a temporary order before the motion goes before the full Appeals Court. James’ brief to the panel is due March 11, and Trump's replies are due March 18.

The ruling comes after New York Judge Arthur Engoron handed down his decision earlier in February after a months-long trial beginning in October and stemming from James' lawsuit alleging the former president inflated his assets and committed fraud.

Engoron ruled that Trump and other defendants were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The judge also barred Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or legal entity in New York for two years.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Engoron also ""permanently"" barred defendants Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and former corporate controller Jeffrey McConney from ""serving in the financial control function of any New York corporation or similar business entity registered and/or licensed in New York State"" and as a director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in New York for three years.

James brought the lawsuit accusing Trump and the Trump Organization of fraudulent business practices. The court proceedings were contentious, with Engoron repeatedly placing Trump under a partial gag order to prevent him from criticizing court staff.

James had sought $370 million, plus 9% interest in penalties from Trump. Any awarded funds would go to the New York State Treasury, unless directed elsewhere by the state comptroller.

Trump dismissed the trial as a ""witch hunt"" throughout the process, accusing both Engoron and James of serving as political operatives for Democrats. Trump's legal team also repeatedly blasted the lack of a jury in the trial.

""There was never an option to choose a jury trial,"" a Trump spokesperson told Fox News Digital last month. ""It is unfortunate that a jury won’t be able to hear how absurd the merits of this case are and conclude no wrongdoing ever happened.""

Trump and his family denied any wrongdoing, with the former president saying his assets had been undervalued. Trump's legal team insisted that his financial statements had disclaimers, and made it clear to banks that they should conduct their own assessments.

JUDGE IMPOSES PARTIAL GAG ORDER IN TRUMP ORG TRIAL, BLOCKING PARTIES FROM VERBAL ATTACKS AGAINST COURT STAFF

Trump has said his financial statements were ""perfect,"" and stressed that the bank loans were repaid and ""as happy as can be.""

Throughout the trial, Trump attorneys brought witnesses, including former Deutsche Bank top executives, who testified the banks sought additional business from Trump, whom they viewed as a ""whale of a client.""

Trump's defense also brought in expert witnesses, including New York University accounting professor Eli Bartov, who reviewed the Trump financial statements at issue in the case and said he found no evidence of accounting fraud.

Bartov testified last month that Trump’s financial statements did not violate accounting principles, and he suggested that anything problematic — like a huge year-to-year leap in the estimated value of his Trump Tower penthouse — was simply an error.

The U.S. delivered its first air drop of aid supplies to Gaza on Saturday, with President Biden's administration saying it would be a ""sustained effort"" to bring more food and other aid.

The first of the airdrops landed in Gaza on Saturday, delivering some 38,000 MREs, or meals ready-to-eat. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says drops will continue throughout the coming weeks in partnership with Jordan and other allies.

""We need to do more and the United States will do more,"" Biden told reporters on Friday. ""Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough.""

The U.S. is also considering the delivery of aid by U.S. navy vessels in the Mediterranean Sea along the coast of Gaza.

PALESTINIAN HUNGER CRISIS CONTINUES AS DESTROYED BAKERIES STRUGGLE TO REOPEN

The U.S. delivered the aid in a joint operation with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, according to a statement from CENTCOM.

Saturday's drop comes after more than 100 people were reported dead and hundreds more wounded when Palestinians rushing toward trucks loaded with humanitarian aid encountered fire in Gaza City early Thursday, according to local media reports.

The exact circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear; while several reports suggested Israeli troops fired on the crowd as they descended upon the trucks, the Israeli military suggested that most who died were trampled.

Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, said at least 104 people were killed and around 760 were wounded, describing the incident as a ""massacre.""

Israel has contested that description, however, saying the vast majority of those killed in the incident were trampled in the rush toward aid.

""Early this morning, during the entry of humanitarian aid trucks into the northern Gaza Strip , Gazan residents surrounded the trucks, and looted the supplies being delivered,"" Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""During the incident, dozens of Gazans were injured as a result of pushing and trampling. The incident is under review.""

The IDF suggested that fewer than 10 civilians were injured by Israeli forces opening fire during the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Hamas says it holds Israel and Biden's administration ""fully responsible"" for the incident and for the ""ethnic cleansing"" of its people. The group called for worldwide demonstrations against Israel's bombardment of Gaza.

Former President Trump attacked his Republican opponent Nikki Haley on Saturday, claiming that former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is ""a little bit"" smarter than her.

Trump addressed an enthusiastic crowd in Richmond, Virginia on Saturday night, days before the Super Tuesday votes are scheduled to take place.

Earlier on Saturday, Trump won the Idaho, Missouri, and Michigan Republican contests. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in the evening, the former president lamented about media coverage of his statements referring to President Biden as ""President Obama.""

Trump maintained that he refers to Biden as ""Obama"" intentionally. He also acknowledged that he has mixed up Haley, who he calls ""Birdbrain,"" with Pelosi.

""I purposely mix up a name, like Birdbrain… you know who Birdbrain is, right, Nikki, with Nancy Pelosi,"" he began.

""I put them in because they're interchangeable in my mind,"" Trump added. ""Except I have to say, I shouldn't say this about a semi-Republican, but I think Pelosi's probably a little bit smarter, actually.""

In January, Haley said that Trump was not ""mentally fit"" for office after he referred to Pelosi as Haley during a speech.

""Last night Trump is at a rally and he’s going on and on, mentioning me multiple times as to why I didn’t take security during the Capitol riots. Why I didn’t handle Jan. 6 better. I wasn’t even in D.C. on Jan. 6. I wasn’t in office then,"" Haley said during a January rally in Keene, New Hampshire.

""They’re saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he’s talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario.""

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has ruled that some criminal defendants who were charged in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, had their sentences improperly increased.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled Friday that defendant Larry Brock’s sentence improperly included charges of ""interference with the administration of justice."" According to Circuit Judge Millett, who wrote the court’s opinion, interference with Congress’ certification of the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election does not apply to a sentence enhancement.

""Brock challenges both the district court’s interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2)’s elements and the sufficiency of the evidence to support that conviction. He also challenges the district court’s application of the three-level sentencing enhancement for interfering with the ‘administration of justice.’""

The appeals court affirmed Brock’s conviction but disagreed on the sentencing, saying: ""As for Brock’s sentence, we hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes.""

AIR FORCE VET SEEN IN CAPITOL WITH ZIP TIES INTENDED 'TO TAKE HOSTAGES,' PROSECUTOR SAYS

Other aspects of Larry Brock’s conviction were upheld but the appeals court said it would ""vacate Brock’s sentence"" and remanded the district court to resentence the single ""interference"" charge.

Other January 6 defendants received longer sentences because of the same charge, which could throw their respective sentences into question.

""Larry Brock participated in the violent January 6th riot at the United States Capitol that forced the evacuation of members of Congress and their staff and prevented Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election until the next day. After a bench trial, the court convicted Brock of six crimes, including corruptly obstructing Congress’s certification of the electoral count under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2),"" Judge Millet wrote. ""At sentencing, the district court applied a three level sentencing enhancement to Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction on the ground that Brock’s conduct resulted in ‘substantial interference with the administration of justice.’""

TRUMP SAYS FILES DELETED BY JAN 6 COMMITTEE ‘EXONERATED ME COMPLETELY’

Brock was initially arrested and charged on January 6, 2021, on just two charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

The ""interference"" charge was added at a later date.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, D.C., Brock was charged after he attended then-President Trump’s ""Stop the Steal Rally"" on the morning of January 6th.

He then marched with others to the U.S. Capitol, entering the building at approximately 2:24 p.m.

HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

""When he arrived, Brock ascended the Upper West Terrace and entered the building through the door to the Senate Wing. After exiting, he attempted to open a set of secured doors marked ‘U.S. Senate’ with an unidentified set of keys,"" the attorney’s office said in 2021.

It continued: ""Brock ultimately reached the Senate floor, where he spent approximately eight minutes walking around and looking at paperwork on desks. During this time, Brock told others not to sit in the Vice President’s chair or to be disrespectful, explaining that the rioters could not afford to ‘lose the IO war.’""

Brock left the Capitol at 3:02 p.m.

""On his way out, he deescalated an altercation between another rioter and Capitol Police officers and guided the rioter out of the Capitol. In total, Brock spent approximately 38 minutes inside the building,"" the attorney’s office said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

EXCLUSIVE: House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is looking at ways to leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars going to colleges and universities to ensure they crack down on antisemitic incidents on campus.

""You have to deliver accountability,"" Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. ""Legislatively, there’s a number of avenues that I’m looking at.""

Stefanik was among a group of lawmakers who heard from Jewish college students at a Thursday roundtable, led by House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., where the young adults recalled instances of feeling threatened and being confronted with profanity just because of their Jewish identity.

It is part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into antisemitism on campus, which has already precipitated the departures of presidents at two major Ivy League schools — Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

‘PURE HATE’: JEWISH STUDENTS DISCUSS LIFE IN WAKE OF ISRAEL WAR

The New York Republican suggested she’s looking at possibly introducing legislation that would help improve the safety of Jewish students on campus as well, specifically targeting federal funds, foreign funding and offices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

""Number one, U.S. taxpayer funding for these institutions — U.S. taxpayers do not want to prop up this moral rot of antisemitism, and we have to make sure that that is not the case,"" Stefanik said. ""Foreign funding as well, there is not full transparency in terms of foreign funding and strings that are attached to that foreign funding. This is a major issue on these college campuses.""

She also listed ""the elimination of the offices of DEI,"" calling DEI ""inherently antisemitic.""

AS UNIVERSITIES GRAPPLE WITH ACTIVISM AND ANTISEMITISM, YALE PROFESSOR INSISTS COLLEGES MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL

""We heard from numerous students today that when Jewish students reach out to offices of DEI, they don't even get a response when it comes to harassment and violence,"" Stefanik said. ""So there's so much work to do, but this is a reckoning. It's an earthquake, and it's long overdue.""

Foxx would not go into detail about her committee’s next steps, but said lawmakers had an abundance of information to digest before moving forward, having sent numerous requests for colleges to shed light on how they are protecting Jewish students on campus.

""We have a lot of work to do with combing through the material that we're getting in from the campuses, and we'll see what happens school by school,"" Foxx told Fox News Digital.

""The most important thing from this roundtable was to make sure that the American people heard what [the students] had to say. Their testimony is compelling, they are in fear on their campuses. And that should not be happening to any student on a college campus in this country. And it is up to the heads of those campuses to make sure that these students are not in fear of their life or their safety.""

For roughly two hours, bipartisan lawmakers heard from students from around the country who said their schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum said Congress was his ""last hope"" because ""Harvard has refused to take any responsibility, any accountability, and to help Jewish students.""

""If antisemitism is a disease, then certainly Harvard University is the Wuhan wet market,"" he said.

Rutgers University student Joe Gindi said a program coordinator at the New Jersey state school once ""screamed"" at Jewish students, ""F--- you. F--- you, colonizer. F--- you, Zionist.""

Instances of antisemitism and Islamophobia have both risen in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, when militants entered the southern part of the country and slaughtered more than 1,200 people during a music festival.

Israel has responded with heavy shelling and a ground invasion of Gaza. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not delineate between fighters and civilians, has said that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed so far.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired.

""Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,"" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman.

Instead of applauding a ""nonpartisan"" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers ""might want to know,"" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement.

""The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,"" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet.

KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT

Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as ""the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.""

""In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,"" it continues.

He is also credited with training ""thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context.

One user described Harris’ tweet as ""like a major self-own"" and said it was ""just sad.""

HALEY SAYS US WILL HAVE 'FEMALE PRESIDENT' — EITHER HERSELF OR KAMALA HARRIS

""Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,"" the user added. ""If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.""

""Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?"" another added.

One user responded: ""Vasu Abhiraman (left) is quite partisan, actually.""

""I really appreciate community notes!"" added another.

And, ""Community Notes FTW [for the win].""

Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign.

Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump.

""As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,"" Williamson said. ""I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.""

""Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?"" she asked. ""What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?""

""We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,"" she added. ""We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’""

The former president began his remarks from the border Thursday afternoon by saying he spoke to the parents of Riley, who he described as ""an incredible young lady.""

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" he said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Trump's visit to the border coincided with President Biden's own trip to a different section of the border between Texas and Mexico. Biden did not mention Riley in his public remarks.

Trump detailed the brutal murder of 22-year-old nursing student Riley last week.

""A beautiful 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia was barbarically attacked. She was on a morning run… she was a beautiful young woman,"" he said. ""I spoke to her parents yesterday, they are incredible people. They are devastated beyond belief. She was so beautiful in so many ways.""

Trump said she was ""brutally assaulted, horrifically beaten, kidnaped, and savagely murdered.""

""The monster, the charge, charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump said, adding that he ""took the name from Hillary because she’s no longer relevant I guess.""

Trump, the 2024 GOP frontrunner, visited Eagle Pass, Texas, Thursday and toured Shelby Park with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and state officials. He also received a briefing and met with Texas officials, as well as Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council.

The former president and 2024 GOP frontrunner also met with Texas National Guard leadership.

Trump made remarks Thursday following the briefing and tour, slamming Biden for being ""incompetent,"" and for destroying the ""most secure border in history"" under his administration.

""I call him Crooked Joe because he's crooked and he's a terrible president, the worst president our country has ever had, probably the most incompetent president we've ever had,"" he continued. ""But it's allowing thousands and thousands of people to come in from China, Iran, Yemen, the Congo, Syria and a lot of other nations.""

Trump said many of those crossing are ""entire columns of fighting-aged men.""

Trump added that the border crisis ""is like a war… it’s a military operation.""

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

ICE CONFIRMS GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT ENTERED US ILLEGALLY, WAS PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED IN NYC

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, ICE confirmed he had been encountered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in August 2022, after entering near El Paso and was ""paroled and released for further processing.""

ICE also confirmed that Ibarra had been arrested by the New York Police Department a year later, on Sept. 14, 2023, and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation.""

When ICE learns that what it believes to be a removable illegal immigrant has been arrested on criminal charges, the agency will normally lodge a detainer — a request asking local law enforcement to keep the suspect in custody until they can be transferred to ICE and put into deportation proceedings.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER SUSPECT JOSE IBARRA LIVED WITHIN 5-MINUTE WALK OF UGA CRIME SCENE

In this case, however, ICE's statement says Ibarra was released before a detainer could be issued. NYC is also a ""sanctuary city,"" which generally restricts law enforcement from complying with ICE detainers.

New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.

Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.

""In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,"" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.

On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a ""personal vendetta"" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, ""$464,576,230.62.""

""+$114,553.04,"" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.

TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, ""+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.""

James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.

Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud,"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.

Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron ""committed errors of law and/or fact"" and whether he abused his discretion or ""acted in excess"" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.

The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.

There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.

""We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,"" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.

Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.

James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.

Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was ""election interference"" and ""weaponization against a political opponent."" Trump said he was being punished for ""having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.""

Former President Trump's campaign appealed a ruling from an Illinois judge that removed the 2024 presidential candidate from state ballots on Thursday.

The Trump campaign appeal contests Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter's ruling that Trump is disqualified from candidacy under the Constitutional ban on ""insurrectionists.""

Porter's ruling reversed last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter urged the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

The Trump campaign promised an appeal within hours of the ruling, and the order is currently on hold until litigation can be completed.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court battle will likely be rendered moot thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court taking up the same question in an upcoming case. In the case, the court will consider for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

The relevant section states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

Trump has not been charged with inciting an insurrection, but he does face allegations of election interference in Washington, D.C. and Georgia.

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

Former President Trump is leading President Biden in a new poll from the New York Times/Sienna College released Saturday, with voters saying they have little confidence in Biden's leadership.

The survey found that 43% of respondents said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today, while 48% said they would vote for Trump. The poll further found that 47% of respondents ""strongly disapprove"" of Biden's handling of the presidency, in addition to 14% who said they ""somewhat disapprove.""

Just 17% stated that they ""strongly approve"" of Biden's handling of the job.

NYT and Sienna conducted the poll from Feb. 25-28, surveying 980 registered voters across the country. The poll was conducted in both English and Spanish using cellphones and landline telephones. It advertised a margin of error of 4%.

The poll further found that just one in four voters believe the country is headed in the right direction. And the number of Americans who believe Biden's policies have hurt them is double the number who believe they have helped, according to the Times.

With regard to the border, 50% of respondents said they would support restricting migrants' ability to apply for asylum, while just 43% said they would oppose the move.

The numbers were even worse for Biden when it comes to the economy, with 74% of Americans saying it is ""poor"" or ""only fair,"" compared to 26% who said the economy is doing ""good"" or ""excellent.""

The House Foreign Affairs Committee is demanding that the head of a global Palestinian refugee agency testify before Congress over the ""many troubling allegations"" leveled against it amid Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.

Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sent a letter to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini insisting that he sit for a public hearing.

""I remain extremely concerned over UNRWA’s widespread allegations of corruption and the millions of taxpayer dollars already sent to UNRWA this fiscal year. A full accounting of UNRWA’s complicity in the October 7th attack – as with all instances of terrorism – is urgently needed,"" McCaul told Fox News Digital.

He said his committee has already heard testimony ""that directly contradicts UNRWA’s claims"" and ""it is now more important than ever that the American people hear directly from Mr. Lazzarini in a public setting.""

TEXAS DEM RUNNING TO UNSEAT TED CRUZ HAS RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN DONATIONS FROM ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISTS

Lazzarini had agreed to come before the committee in late January in a ""closed, members-only setting,"" according to the letter, citing ""UN privileges and immunities"" that prevented him from appearing in the open.

""With regard to your letter, we must first point out that UN privileges and immunities do not forbear voluntary testimony,"" the lawmakers responded. ""Second, many members of this Committee are gravely concerned, but sadly, unsurprised by allegations that employees of UNRWA participated in the horrendous October 7th attack and that thousands of employees have familial or direct ties to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""

""Furthermore, we are outraged by recent reporting that a Hamas military installation and server room is located directly beneath UNRWA’s Gaza headquarters. To make matters worse, Hamas operated this installation by siphoning electricity from UNRWA.""

McCaul pointed out that Lazzarini had appeared before European lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 for ""an Exchange of Views in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).""

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB REFUSES TO SAY WHETHER SHE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN DURING CEASE-FIRE PRESSER

""If you are willing to appear before the AFET, you surely can and would be willing to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee especially given the United States’ long term and considerable financial support to UNRWA,"" he said.

The letter is co-led by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., subcommittee chairs on Foreign Affairs.

The U.N. is conducting an internal, but independent investigation after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staffers of taking part in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack last year that killed more than 1,200 people – mostly civilians.

The Biden administration has paused funding for the agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after the allegations were leveled. The U.S. had designated $51 million toward UNRWA for fiscal year 2024.

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had ""devastating consequences,"" and demands immediate action.

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

""Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,"" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. ""Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.""

TRUMP BLAMES 'BIDEN'S BORDER INVASION' FOR LAKEN RILEY MURDER, VOWS 'LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION' IF ELECTED

They added, ""Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.""

""Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,"" they wrote.

The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he ""should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.""

""The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,"" they wrote, adding that Biden should ""immediately revoke your harmful executive orders"" and ""issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.""

Biden ""should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,"" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.

BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,"" they continued. ""We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.""

The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder ""has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.""

""President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. ""His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.""

""Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,"" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.""

She added, ""It’s past time to act.""

The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.

""We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.""

The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.

Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the ""invasion"" that led to Riley’s death.

An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections.

According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or ""cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,"" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the ""disqualification clause,"" for engaging in insurrection.

Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection.

REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT

However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court.

A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it ""is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.""

The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, ""No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE

Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection.

Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling.

""The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,"" Pelosi wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT

The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports.

Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.

But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The primary election is set for March 19.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said in his floor speech. ""So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.""

The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

""As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.""

Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for ""the next generation"" to assume leadership in the Senate.

TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM'

""There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,"" he said. ""I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.""

McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.

His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted ""a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.""

""Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,"" McConnell said. ""I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.""

McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as ""Mitch O'Donnell"" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.

REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH

In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.

As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.

In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.

The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.

Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.

On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.

Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.

RAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT

""Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. ""He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.""

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell ""a true legend of the U.S. Senate"" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.

""He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,"" Tillis said. ""He leaves very big shoes to fill.""

Others were less kind.

""I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ""But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.""

Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis.

Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded ""absolutely"" in the text exchange.

When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter ""dang."" But then he said he was ""speculating"" in those comments.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on ""lies about your friends.""

""Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?"" Rice asked.

""I could have had, I don't know,"" Bradley responded.

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an ""in-camera"" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.

Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.

Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce.

McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.

Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.

The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.

Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

She testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.

The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as ""belligerent.""

She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.

McAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it’s ""clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.""

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris.

Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper.

""Donald Trump will not win the general election,"" Haley told Tapper. ""You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.""

HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: 'LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

""We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.""

Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris.

Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary.

Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election.

""If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,"" Haley said in the interview.

Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.

She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House.

""We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,"" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.

That figure comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year's record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.

The total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.

That is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER

Compared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California's population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It's more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.

Were the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.

Taken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden's critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.

""This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn't an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,"" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER'S ‘WARZONE’

Republicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump's border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external ""push"" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.

However, the president's critics say migrants face more of a ""pull"" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden's lenient policies.

""The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,"" Ruark told Fox News Digital. ""In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.""

Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won't face deportation for entering the country illegally.

""They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you'll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,"" Mehlman said. ""Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn't have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.""

LARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS

Biden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an ""emergency border authority"" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.

But conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump's policies and secure the border.

While the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and violating the ""public trust.""

DHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.

Biden said that ""history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.""

Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley blamed former President Trump Friday for recent Republican losses in critical electoral races, including those for seats in the Senate, while expressing hope the GOP's new leader in the upper chamber is focused on setting a tone rather than courting Trump.

""You're seeing the wave of what Congress thinks they need to do to win,"" Haley told reporters during a briefing at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood.

Haley was likely referencing Trump's dominance over the House and Senate relative to endorsements and influence.

But Haley suggested lawmakers who cater to the former president are misguided because Republicans have lost pivotal matchups since his presidency.

SENATE REPUBLICANS KEEP HOPE FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT ALIVE

""All of these losses happened after Donald Trump became president in 2016,"" she said, noting gubernatorial, federal and statewide losses in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia.

Haley claimed the only reason Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., was elected in 2021 was because ""he distanced himself"" from Trump.

Youngkin's political team declined to comment to Fox News Digital.

""It’s not an accurate statement,"" according to Zack Roday, a former Youngkin adviser and partner at Ascent Media.

DC PRIMARY REPRESENTS HALEY'S BEST CHANCE YET TO BEAT TRUMP

""Glenn Youngkin won because he built a movement and coalition of Republicans, independents and even Democrats who wanted a new direction for Virginia.""

Despite the losses, Haley claimed members of the House and Senate are now ""falling all over themselves to show that they're more Trump than everybody else.""

Haley weighed in on what the next Senate Republican leader should bring to the table after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's surprise announcement Wednesday that he's stepping down. She didn't suggest any specific senators for the role but explained she wants a leader focused on the people and ""not rewarding people for peacocking on TV.""

""I want to see somebody inspirational. I want to see somebody that says, ‘You know what, we can do things differently,'"" Haley said. ""My hope is that we will. But we'll have to see.""

Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital the campaign's focus is now on Biden and the general election.

""Republican voters have delivered resounding wins for President Trump in every single primary contest, and this race is over,"" she said.

Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father ""because there isn't any,"" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

""I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,"" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. ""Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.""

""You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,"" he continued in his opening statement.

The first son said that for more than a year, the committees ""have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. ""

""You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,"" he testified.

The first son said House Republicans ""have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by"" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.

""Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,"" he said.

Hunter Biden, reflecting on ""mistakes"" he has made in his life, said he has ""squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.""

""But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,"" he said.

Reflecting on his ""battle with addiction,"" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.

""He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,"" he testified. ""What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.""

Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.

""Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,"" he said. ""Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.""

He added: ""If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.""

The first son said he hopes his testimony will ""put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.""

""You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,"" he testified.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said ""there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,"" after his client's testimony.

""Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,"" Lowell said, adding: ""Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.""

Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A crucial witness in the motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case was far more involved in the effort than previously known.

Terrence Bradley — former law partner and divorce attorney of prosecutor Nathan Wade — testified under oath Tuesday regarding what he knew about Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley that couldn't claim attorney-client privilege.

Text messages have now emerged that show Bradley cooperated extensively with Ashleigh Merchant, attorney for former President Donald Trump's co-defendant Michael Roman in the Georgia case, in the effort to disqualify Willis.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

A cache of over 400 text messages between Bradley and Merchant obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows continuous back-and-forth exchanges about Willis's relationship with Wade.

Bradley offered input on individuals to subpoena for testimony on Willis and Wade's relationship. He also derided Willis as ""arrogant,"" encouraging Merchant in her motion to disqualify the district attorney from the Trump case.

""I am nervous,"" Merchant wrote in a text message on Jan. 8 — just a day after filling the motion. ""This is huge.""

Bradley responded, ""You are huge. You will be fine. You are one of the best lawyers I know. Go be great.""

JUDGE SAYS NATHAN WADE'S DIVORCE LAWYER MUST TESTIFY ON RELATIONSHIP WITH FULTON CO. DA FANI WILLIS

Merchant gave Bradley a copy of her motion before filing, asking for guidance to make sure everything was accurate.

""Anything else? Anything that isn’t accurate?"" Merchant texted Bradley.

""Looks good,"" Bradley replied.

One piece of information put forth in the text messages ended up falling apart this week when Bradley testified under oath.

""Do you think it started before she hired him?"" Merchant asked via text on Jan. 5, three days prior to filing the motion.

""Absolutely,"" Bradley replied.

But in court Tuesday, Bradley claimed he was ""speculating"" in those text message exchanges.

FANI WILLIS, NATHAN WADE REFERRED TO GEORGIA STATE BAR FOR MISCONDUCT BY WATCHDOG GROUP

Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information over two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also claimed he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade.

Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an ""improper"" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.

During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.

Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.

The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should be disqualified.

Mike Dunleavy has threatened to veto an education package overwhelmingly passed by lawmakers after a bruising debate, saying it lacks provisions he favors, including a pilot program offering annual bonuses of up to $15,000 as a way to attract and keep teachers.

Dunleavy, a former educator, said this week that there is still time for lawmakers to address issues like the proposed bonuses and changes to the application process for charter schools aimed at promoting such schools. The governor has 15 days, excluding Sundays, to act on a bill sent to him if the Legislature is in session.

He can sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. A decision is expected by March 14.

ALASKA FACES TEACHER SHORTAGE AS EDUCATION FUNDING DEBATE DOMINATES LEGISLATURE

Some key lawmakers say the package was a compromise and question whether the state can afford the bonuses — or even if they would work.

Debate over education funding has dominated this legislative session. The House last week voted 38-2 to support a compromise package that included a $175-million increase in aid to districts through a school funding formula; language encouraging districts to use some of the extra funding for teacher salary and retention bonuses; a state education department position dedicated to supporting charter schools and additional funding for K-3 students who need reading help. The vote followed a period of intense debate that also showed divisions within the Republican-led majority.

The Senate, led by a bipartisan coalition, agreed 18-1 on Monday to support the package, sending it to Dunleavy.

The compromise stemmed from negotiations after the House failed to support bringing up for debate a version of the bill that advanced from the House Rules Committee. That version included Dunleavy’s bonus plan, charter provisions and a roughly $80 million increase in state aid through the formula.

After the bill passed the House, Republican Speaker Cathy Tilton said that while the compromise ""fell short"" of the earlier proposal, ""I’d still call it a ‘qualified’ success.""

School officials had sought a roughly $360 million increase in funding, citing the impact of inflation and high energy and insurance costs. But the state, which relies heavily on oil and earnings from Alaska's nest-egg oil-wealth fund, has struggled with deficits over the last decade, and some lawmakers questioned whether that amount was realistic.

The Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million boost last year, but Dunleavy vetoed half that. Lawmakers did not have enough votes for an override.

Dunleavy has cast the bonuses and support of charter schools as a way of doing things differently. He has questioned whether simply increasing funding to districts will improve student performance.

He has proposed paying teachers bonuses of $5,000 to $15,000 a year over three years, with the highest amount for those in the most remote areas. Estimates suggest the program could cost about $55 million a year.

The language in the education package encouraging districts to use some of the funds for bonuses ""does not ensure the desired ends are realized,"" Dunleavy spokesperson Grant Robinson said by email Thursday.

Republican Senate President Gary Stevens told reporters this week that there is a limit to what the state can afford. A revised revenue forecast is expected by mid-March, and lawmakers haven't even begun publicly debating how big this year's dividend payout to residents from oil-wealth fund earnings should be — typically one of the most contentious debates of the session.

Sen. Bill Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, raised questions about how well bonuses might work. He said he thinks there's a ""fair expectation"" that teachers from overseas or the Lower 48 would leave after the three years is up.

He said the level of support for the compromise bill was ""pretty unheard of these days"" for a controversial measure.

Tom Klaameyer, president of NEA-Alaska, a teachers' union, said if Dunleavy vetoes the education package, ""then our schools remain in crisis.""

The measure ""was simply a life preserver that was being thrown or could have been thrown to schools to stem the crisis,"" he said.

He added: ""We’re saying, throw the life preserver.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Speaker Mike Johnson bucked the House GOP’s right flank to pass a short-term federal funding bill on Thursday, setting up Congress to avoid a partial government shutdown.

The bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), extends fiscal 2023’s government funding levels to two deadlines: March 8 and March 22. It passed the House, 320-99.

Majorities in both parties voted for the bill, although more Democrats than Republicans supported it – 113 GOP lawmakers voted for the CR while 97 voted against, and 207 Democrats voted for it versus just two who were opposed. In a modest win for Johnson, however, this CR got more GOP votes than the extension he put on the House floor in January, which got 107 Republicans' support.

Congress is currently operating under a CR passed in January that extended funding for some of its 12 appropriations bills to March 1 and others to March 8.

TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS FLEE CAPITOL HILL AMID RISING CHAOS, DIVISION: 'A BAD WORKPLACE'

House GOP leaders were forced to seek Democrat votes, which were likely anyway, to pass the bill. They fast-tracked it under suspension of the rules, meaning it forgoes the normal process of going through the House Rules Committee and a House-wide procedural vote in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.

It comes after GOP rebels weaponized procedural House votes several times to deliberately sink their own party’s legislation as a protest against leadership.

Many of those same rebels have pushed Johnson to allow for the government to shut down instead of extending the previous Democrat-controlled Congress’ funding levels. They argued that a shutdown, even a partial one, would give House Republicans leverage to push for conservative policies.

HOUSE GOP LEADERS JETTISON PROMISE TO VOTE ON 12 INDIVIDUAL SPENDING BILLS

With expected furloughs of federal employees and suspension of government programs, however, a government shutdown is a politically perilous outcome for both Republicans and Democrats.

This is the fourth CR the House has passed since fiscal 2023 ended on Sept. 30.

""We have to be willing to do what's difficult to save America. I'm not scared of a government shutdown if it's the price we need to pay to secure our border, get our debt under control and stop the government from going after my fellow Americans,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

But Johnson said during his weekly press conference that it would buy negotiators just enough time to release legislative text for their first six spending bills over the weekend while avoiding the negative effects of a partial shutdown.

""All of our members will have 72 hours to review it. That's our commitment. That's our rule. We're respecting it. And that's the only reason we need the process CR, to allow us time to do that,"" Johnson said.

""If I did it the way … [former House] Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi did, we just drop that bill and vote on it within hours. We're not going to do that.""

The CR must now pass the Senate and be signed by President Biden to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio warned on social media that the AT&T outage affecting tens of thousands of Americans pales in comparison to what a potential China cyberattack would look like.

""I don’t know the cause of the AT&T outage,"" the Florida Republican posted on X on Thursday. ""But I do know it will be 100 times worse when #China launches a cyber attack on America on the eve of a #Taiwan invasion.

""And it won’t be just cell service they hit, it will be your power, your water and your bank.""

Rubio's warning came as tens of thousands of AT&T customers reported outages on Thursday morning for their home phone, internet and mobile phone services, according to Downdetector.

CHINESE HACKERS HAD ACCESS TO US INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 'AT LEAST 5 YEARS' BEFORE DISCOVERY

The outages started popping up just before 3:30 a.m. ET, according to a graph shown on the website that tracks outages.

Most users, 54%, say they are having issues with mobile phone service. More than a third of customers reporting being affected say they have no signal at all, and 8% of users say their mobile internet is down.

Earlier this month, FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China's cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies are reaching a ""fever pitch.""

""You might find your companies harassed and hacked, targeted by a web of corporate CCP proxies,"" Wray told the leaders gathered in Germany. ""You might also find PRC [People’s Republic of China] hackers lurking in your power stations, your phone companies and other infrastructure, poised to take them down when they decide you stepped too far out of line, and that hurting your civilian population suits the CCP.""

""China-sponsored hackers pre-positioned for potential cyberattacks against U.S. oil and natural gas companies way back in 2011, but these days, it’s reached something closer to a fever pitch,"" he continued. ""What we’re seeing now is China’s increasing build-out of offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure, poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.""

The head of the union that represents Border Patrol agents across the country exploded on President Biden during a Thursday press conference, declaring agents were ""mad as hell,"" and ""p----d"" over his policies that allowed the situation at the border to deteriorate so badly.

National Border Patrol Council (NBCP) President Brandon Judd appeared alongside former President Donald Trump in Eagle Pass, Texas, which he described as the ""epicenter"" of the border crisis, as Biden held a dueling event a few hundred miles away at the less affected Brownsville, Texas.

""Sir, I want you to know your agents, my agents, they're mad as hell — absolutely mad that President Biden went to Brownsville, Texas, rather than going to Arizona, rather than going to San Diego, California, rather than coming to Eagle Pass, Texas, which has been the epicenter,"" Judd said after Trump invited him to the microphone to speak.

Judd said the trip allowed Trump to see how his policies worked compared to those implemented by the Biden administration, and that he had the clarity on how to expand them should he be elected president in November.

""Your agents … they are pissed. Border patrol agents are upset that we cannot get the proper policy that is necessary to protect human life, to protect American citizens, to protect the people that are crossing the border illegally,"" Judd said. ""We can't do that because President Biden's policies continue to invite people to cross here.""

""Thank goodness we have a governor like Governor Abbott. Thank goodness we have somebody that's willing to run for President of the United States, forego everything else he's been doing to serve the American people. Mr. President, thank you,"" he added.

President Biden signed a funding measure on Friday that was agreed upon by congressional leaders and passed in both the House and Senate, once again averting a government shutdown.

Biden signed H.R. 7463, a funding bill titled ""Extension of Continuing Appropriations and Other Matters Act, 2024,"" which extends the March 1 funding deadline for the first slate of appropriations bills by one week, pushing it to March 8.

Those bills will head to the House and Senate for votes in the next week.

The funding bill also moves the second deadline for a second slate of bills to March 22.

However, the second group of appropriations measures still need to be finalized and agreed upon before heading to the floor for votes.

""We are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Wednesday, along with House Appropriations Committee Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine.

Congressional Republicans are slamming the Biden administration's border policies after a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border illegally was charged with the murder of a Georgia nursing student.

Twenty-six-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra, the suspect charged in the murder of nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus, is a Venezuelan national who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, three ICE & DHS sources told Fox News.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared his condolences with Riley's family and friends while also reemphasizing Republicans' efforts to pass border legislation.

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""The brutal murderer who took the life of Laken was one of the millions of illegal aliens that the Biden Administration simply released and unleashed upon our country,"" Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""For Laken, and the countless many others lost to this border catastrophe, House Republicans will continue to fight tooth and nail for a return to law and order. Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,"" he added.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, ""demanding information"" on Ibarra's immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.

""Joe Biden's failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I'm demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!"" Kemp wrote in an X post.

In the letter, the Republican governor called Biden's silence on illegal immigration statistics ""outrageous.""

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp said. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration's failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country,"" he said.

Georgia Republicans Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde called out Biden on X, saying that he has ""blood"" on his hands following Riley's death.

""Laken Riley, 22-year-old UGA nursing student, was murdered by an illegal alien from Venezuela that the Biden admin released in our country,"" Greene wrote. ""Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and the Democrats have blood on their hands. Praying for her family.""

""Laken Riley, the 22-year old nursing student found dead on the UGA campus, was murdered by an illegal alien,"" Clyde posted on X. ""The Venezuelan migrant, Jose Antonio Ibarra, illegally crossed the border and was released on parole in September 2022. Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""

LAKEN RILEY CASE: GEORGIA AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY MURDER SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN NURSING STUDENT'S SLAYING

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., of Arizona echoed Greene and Clyde's sentiments, writing, ""These are the tragic consequences of open border policies. The Biden Administration has blood on its hands.""

Senator J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called the situation enraging, saying that Ibarra should never have been in the country.

""Enraging. He shouldn’t have been in our country. And now an innocent American is dead,"" Vance wrote.

The White House insisted on Friday that House Republicans stand in the way of a solution to what Biden has called a ""broken"" immigration system.

""For the past several months, we worked with Republican senators and also Democrats in the Senate to try to come up with a fair and tough piece of legislation that would deal with border security,"" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily White House press briefing.

UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICE QUESTIONING ‘PERSON OF INTEREST’ IN LAKEN RILEY HOMICIDE

She noted that a bipartisan deal reached last month had been endorsed by the Border Patrol union before Johnson declared it ""dead on arrival.""

""Speaker Johnson has gotten in the way of this,"" Jean-Pierre added. ""We did our job. The Senate did their job in a bipartisan way.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

Ibarra was taken into custody by UGA police Friday and has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending UGA before entering a nursing program at the University of Augusta's Athens campus.

According to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital, multiple officers began searching for Riley near the Intramural Fields around 12:07 p.m. At 12:38, a UGA police officer spotted her on the ground.

""I called out to Riley, and I did not get a response,"" the officer wrote.

She had visible injuries, and police could not locate a pulse. They began CPR anyway. A sergeant arrived with a defibrillator minutes later and unsuccessfully attempted to revive the victim.

Autopsy results remained pending Friday, but authorities said they were investigating her death as a homicide. Clark said it appeared as though she had been killed by blunt-force trauma.

Kemp's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A Lubbock, Texas, federal judge ruled Tuesday that lawmakers unconstitutionally passed the $1.7 trillion government funding bill in 2022 when they did so under a pandemic-era rule allowing members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote on the matter by proxy instead of in person.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, requested the courts block a provision of the funding bill that gave pregnant workers stronger legal protections.

U.S. District Judge Wesley Hendrix reviewed the request and issued a ""limited"" ruling on one of two provisions Paxton sought to have blocked.

Hendrix, appointed by former President Trump, ruled the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act was wrongfully passed, blocking the law from being enforced against the state as an employer.

TEXAS AG KEN PAXTON SAYS STATE WON’T COMPLY WITH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ORDER TO REOPEN PARK TO FEDERAL AGENTS

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, enacted in December 2022, requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers.

In his ruling, Hendrix noted that his injunction is only applicable to state government employees.

Paxton filed a lawsuit last year, arguing the federal spending package was unconstitutionally passed because over half of the House of Representatives were not physically present to provide a quorum, yet they still voted by proxy.

EAGLE PASS MAYOR SAYS SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TEXAS, FEDS OVER BORDER CONTROL IS 'FRUSTRATING,' A 'CONSTANT STRUGGLE'

In May 2020, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, helped get a rule in place allowing lawmakers to vote by proxy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

When Republicans took control of the House in 2022, they ditched the proxy rule after challenging it in court unsuccessfully.

Hendrix said in a 120-page ruling that for over 200 years leading up to the voting proxy rule’s adoption, Congress understood that the majority of members of the House or Senate were required to be physically present to have a quorum to pass legislation, as stipulated under the Constitution’s quorum clause.

TEXAS AG PAXTON SUES NGO AIDING MIGRANTS, ACCUSES IT OF ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

""Supreme Court precedent has long held that the Quorum Clause requires presence, and the Clause’s text distinguishes those absent members from the quorum and provides a mechanism for obtaining a physical quorum by compelling absent members to attend,"" he wrote.

Paxton said Congress acted ""egregiously"" when it passed the $1.7 trillion funding bill.

""Congress acted egregiously by passing the largest spending bill in U.S. history with fewer than half the members of the House bothering to do their jobs, show up and vote in person,"" Paxton said. ""Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi abused proxy voting under the pretext of COVID-19 to pass this law, then Biden signed it, knowing they violated the Constitution. This was a stunning violation of the rule of law. I am relieved the court upheld the Constitution.""

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.

Reuters reported that Texas Public Policy Foundation lawyer Matthew Miller said the ruling ""correctly"" concluded a physical quorum was required to vote.

Hendrix also found in his ruling that Texas did not have standing to challenge $20 million appropriated in the bill to fund a pilot program providing case management and other services to noncitizens during immigration removal proceedings.

FIRST ON FOX — Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott slammed what he called a ""two-tiered standard"" concerning President Biden mulling executive action to handle the border crisis, and how former President Trump was treated during his presidency when he attempted to do the same thing.

""Well, there's no question that there's a two-tiered standard in our national media. The way they cover President Trump versus the way that they use kid gloves to cover Joe Biden. There's no question about that,"" Scott said during a Thursday interview with Fox News Digital when asked about reports that Biden is weighing executive action to crack down on asylum-seeking.

""More important, however, is that when we had President Trump in office, we actually had a basically sealed southern border. Crossings were around a thousand a day. Under President Biden in December, we had 10,000 crossings on average per day,"" he added. ""That contrast should be what the media is covering.""

TRUMP VP AUDITIONS: SCOTT RAMASWAMY HIT TRAIL IN SOUTH CAROLINA ON BEHALF OF FORMER PRESIDENT

An administration source told Fox earlier this week that Biden is considering executive action to restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum amid historic numbers of border crossings facing the country, but that it’s one of ""several"" plans being looked at.

An administration official also stressed that there have been no final decisions on what actions, if any, could be taken and that exploring policy options does not mean they will come to pass.

One of the options reportedly on the table is use of 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to restrict certain categories of foreigners who are deemed ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Trump attempted to use it but was blocked by a federal court, a ruling later upheld by the Supreme Court.

HISPANIC HOUSE DEMS ACCUSE BIDEN OF LEAVING THEM IN DARK ON POSSIBLE EXECUTIVE ACTION AT BORDER

The former president also faced sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the liberal media for attempting to use executive action on immigration, including being called ""xenophobic"" and ""racist.""

Biden has yet to face the same widespread level of criticism, although some of the more progressive Democrats have lashed out at the idea of Biden reverting to the previous administration's approach.

""Democrats CANNOT solve immigration problems by adopting Trump-like policies,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote in a post on X, while Rep. Jesús García, D-Ill., claimed, ""President Biden would be making a grave mistake if he moves forward with this policy.""

DEMOCRAT IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE UNDER FIRE FOR PAST AMNESTY, SANCTUARY CITY ‘SUPPORT’ AS BORDER CRISIS SPIRALS

The possible executive action by Biden comes just under two weeks after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border crisis.

During a gaggle with reporters after casting his vote in the South Carolina primary earlier in the day, Scott told Fox that he ""certainly"" supported Mayorkas' impeachment, and he praised the House for having the ""courage"" to take such action. However, he admitted the task likely wouldn't go anywhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

""The best way to eliminate Mayorkas being the secretary is to actually fire Joe Biden,"" he said. ""If we really want to change the trajectory of the country as it relates to immigration — illegal immigration — we have to do so by having someone, a commander-in-chief, who respects our borders, who wants to close our borders.""

Wade was hired in 2022 to help prosecute the sweeping case against Trump and 18 other co-defendants on charges related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including racketeering, violating the oath of office, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, forgery and false statements.

Four co-defendants in the case alleged in subsequent court filings that Wade was romantically involved with Willis at the time he was hired and that she financially benefitted from his employment because of their relationship and lavish vacations they took together.

Co-defendants have also alleged that Wade’s ""lack of experience"" prosecuting complex cases makes him ""unqualified"" to work the case and questioned why Willis hired him in the first place.

GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE

A John Marshall Law School graduate, Wade worked in private practice at his firm Wade & Campbell prior to his work with the Fulton County DA’s office.

""Whether you are in need of representation after a major car accident or are going through a change in your personal life that requires representation with a family law issue; whether you have a contract dispute, or whether you are involved in any type of civil litigation, Nathan J. Wade will be a zealous advocate for you,"" his firm’s website reads.

The New York Times reported that public records show ""scant evidence"" that he has prosecuted major criminal cases, with no evidence that he has handled a major political corruption case or one involving the state’s ""complicated racketeering statute"" under which all the defendants in the Trump case have been charged.

FANI WILLIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH WINK ON THE STAND, LABELS FORMER LOVER NATHAN WADE A 'SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN'

In 1999, Wade spent four months as an assistant solicitor in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County. From 2011 to 2021, he was an associate municipal court judge in Marietta, Georgia, handling misdemeanor cases.

Wade ran for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court three times between 2012 and 2016 but lost each time.

5 EXPLOSIVE MOMENTS FROM FANI WILLIS' HEATED TESTIMONY IN TRUMP FULTON COUNTY CASE: 'IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN …'

Wade took the stand on Thursday during a tense court hearing to hash out evidence to allegations that Willis had financially benefitted from Wade’s employment.

Both Willis and Wade testified that Wade had routinely paid for the trips and that Willis would reimburse him with cash. When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep six months of regular expenses on hand in cash.

Wade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that had been made in cash.

Wade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims.

""You don’t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?"" Gillen asked.

""No, sir,"" Wade said.

""Not a single solitary one,"" Gillen pressed.



""Not a one.""

Willis, in her testimony, called Wade a ""southern gentleman."" Willis said her relationship with Wade ended roughly last summer but that the two remain ""very good friends"" and are ""probably closer than ever because of these attacks.""

Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradict testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former ""good friend"" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office. Yeartie said she had ""no doubt"" the Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.

Yeartie testified to observing Willis and Wade ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" and showing ""affection"" prior to November 2021, and that she had no doubt that the two were in a ""romantic"" relationship starting in 2019, to when she and Willis last spoke in 2022.

Willis dismissed Yeartie's testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie to be a friend.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A transgender lawmaker stormed out of the Virginia Senate chamber in protest after Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears referred to the lawmaker as ""sir"" on Monday.

Sen. Danica Roem, a Democrat and the first transgender person to serve in the Virginia legislature, is biologically male but identifies as a woman. Roem asked a question about a piece of legislation during a general session on Monday afternoon.

""Madam President, how many votes would it take to pass this bill with the emergency clause?"" Roem asked.

""That would be four-fifths, Senator,"" Sears responded.

""And what would be the exact number of that, Madam President?"" Roem asked again.

""Yes, sir, that would be 32,"" Sears said.

Roem could then be heard putting down the microphone and leaving the chamber. The lawmaker did not cast a vote in the roll call vote moments later.

Sears offered an apology for the incident later in the session, though she did not specifically apologize for referring to Roem by the lawmaker's biological gender.

""I upset Sen. Roem,"" Sears said. ""Let it be known I am not here to upset anyone. I am here to do the job the people of Virginia have called me to do, and that is to treat everyone with respect and dignity. I myself have at times not been afforded that same respect and dignity.""

""But in this body, as long as I am president of the Senate and by the grace of God, I will be treated with respect and dignity, and I will treat everyone else with respect and dignity,"" she added. ""It is never my intention to make anyone offended, and I hope that others would consider that they would try not to offend me as well,"" she said. ""We are all equal under the law. And so I apologize, I apologize, I apologize, and I would hope, I would hope, that everyone would understand there is no intent to offend but that we would also give each other the ability to forgive each other.""

Please enter a valid email address.

FIRST ON FOX - Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis and her former lover Nathan Wade are facing two ethics complaints from a conservative government watchdog group based on their court testimony on allegations they had an 'improper' affair.

The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) is requesting that the Georgia state bar open disciplinary proceedings against the Fulton County DA and Wade for violations of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct.

AAF is alleging Wade lied under oath about his relationship with Willis, and alleging that Willis admitted to keeping campaign money for personal use on the witness stand.

""To ensure that the citizens of Fulton County and the State of Georgia understand that the Bar will not countenance any violation of its ethics by those charged with upholding it, we urge you to revoke Ms. Willis’ license to practice law and permanently bar her from practicing law,"" adding the same request in a separate complaint against Wade.

KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIR

The complaint against Willis notes that on Feb 15. 2024 she testified before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee and was questioned regarding her reimbursement of Wade and her use of cash with no bank or transaction receipts. Willis was asked where the cash originally came from, to which she replied:

""Cash is fungible. I’ve had cash for years in my house. So for me to tell you the source of where it comes from ... when you go to Publix and you buy something and you get fifty dollars and you throw it in there. It’s been my whole life. When I took out a large amount of money during my first campaign, I kept some of the cash of that.""

AAF claims that Willis’ ""admission"" represents ""the admission of a clear violation of Georgia Campaign Finance law."" The portion of that law they say is applicable states that, ""Nothing in this Code section shall permit or authorize a candidate to utilize campaign funds for the purpose of making gifts, loans, or investments directly to: (A) The candidate…""

""The statute is unambiguous – and the facts are not in dispute – as Ms. Willis described in her testimony, she placed the money that was intended for her campaign into a ""fungible"" slush fund with other moneys that she would use for various other purposes, including reimbursing her boyfriend for leisure travel,"" the complaint states.

FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS

The complaint also states that her ""keeping some of the cash"" was a ""willful intentional act and denied the citizens of Georgia the ability to exercise effective oversight over her campaign.""

""It is unreasonable to believe that a barred attorney running for public office would not have been aware that the strict reporting guidelines of Georgia campaign finance law existed to protect the public’s right to oversee elections and that she had an obligation to scrupulously abide by them,"" the complaint states.

The complaint against Wade alleges that he lied under oath on more than one occasion. When asked on an interrogatory to ""describe each instance in which you have had sexual relations with a person other than your spouse during the course of the marriage,"" and he said, ""none.""

Wade testified that his marriage ""was irretrievably broken in 2015"" but that he and his wife agreed to delay a divorce for the sake of their children.

""First it is simply not credible that Mr. Wade did not know that he had sexual relations with Ms. Willis when he replied to the interrogatories above in his divorce case. Put simply, it is clear Mr. Wade knew that he had had sex with Ms. Willis, and he knew that at the time he was still married, and he simply lied in the interrogatories,"" the AAF complaint states.

FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR

""Whether he was married was not a complicated question. In fact, he was the plaintiff in a divorce case, a case that cannot proceed without the parties being married. As an officer of the court, this is simply unacceptable. It is challenging to think of a more clear-cut example of ‘dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,’"" the complaint says.

The complaint goes on to say that Wade’s ""rationale for not answering the interrogatories truthfully under questioning shows a whole lack of understanding of the law that makes him unfit to practice law in the State,"" deeming him a risk to future potential clients.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""The Bar owes the profession and the public a duty to guard the practice from charlatans and incompetents. Any simple reading of Mr. Wade’s testimony quickly reveals that he is so grossly unfamiliar with the simple understanding of a legal concept like marriage that the risk he and his incompetence poses to vulnerable members of the public requires his exclusion from the profession,"" it states.

Willis and Wade did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

House managers serve as ""prosecutors"" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.

One impeachment manager told Fox they had been given ""no clear guidance"" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.

Fox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Fox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.

RANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS

Several factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.

That said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.

Some House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.

A senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a ""comprehensive briefing"" last week and ""detailed"" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.

Despite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that ""we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.""

Some House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.

Fox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing ""mock trial"" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.

HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS

""We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,"" said one frustrated manager.

There has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.

Managers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned ""subject lanes"" to argue before the Senate.

One manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.

FIRST ON FOX: A GOP lawmaker accused a nonprofit shelter network of sponsoring a migrant who was recently accused of killing a Georgia nursing student, letting him use its federally funded resources after he entered the U.S. illegally and before he allegedly committed the crime.

Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, sent a letter to Covenant House, a national network of youth homeless shelters, saying that Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) documents indicate that Jose Ibarra, 26, used a New York facility as his sponsor address after he crossed the border in September 2022.

Covenant House denied sponsoring Ibarra.

Gooden questioned whether Covenant House was properly vetting people who came through its doors, whether Ibarra lied about allegedly staying there, and if the organization was encouraging migrants to use its address on federal forms.

Covenant House told Fox News Digital it did not sponsor Ibarra and denied being contacted by federal authorities about him.

""Covenant House does not sponsor the entry of any migrants into the United States. It is neither a policy nor a practice. Covenant House New York did not sponsor Jose Antonio Ibarra’s entry into the country and has not done so for any other person,"" a spokesperson said.

""We do not know how our address came to be on his form, but there have been and continue to be instances when our address is given at the border. We have not been contacted by ICE/DHS regarding this matter, nor have we ever been contacted by them about the use of Covenant House’s name on a form at the border.""

Gooden's letter, sent to Covenant House CEO Bill Bedrossian, stated: ""According to CBP documents, after illegally crossing into El Paso, Jose Antonio Ibarra provided The Covenant House, a federally funded NGO in New York, as his sponsor address. These NGOs receive hundreds of millions in taxpayer funding per year through a left-wing loophole designed to circumvent a federal law that prevents tax dollars from funding illegal immigration.

""I have been fighting to hold NGOs like Covenant House accountable for years. Their usage of federal funds to traffic millions of migrants is unacceptable and has now become deadly.""

GEORGIA NURSING STUDENT FOUND DEAD ON UGA CAMPUS IDENTIFIED AS LAKEN RILEY

Ibarra is charged with murdering 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student Laken Riley, who was killed while jogging at the nearby campus of the University of Georgia.

Her death has sparked renewed scrutiny over how effectively U.S. officials are evaluating migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border before granting entry, primarily to await immigration court proceedings.

In his letter, Gooden asked Covenant House how long Ibarra had stayed at its facility, if he did, and whether Covenant House coordinates with groups in Mexico to share its address with people trying to enter the U.S.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

""Instead of prioritizing the safety and security of American citizens, the Biden administration has chosen to prioritize the interests of illegal immigrants, providing them with sanctuary and support at the expense of taxpayers,"" Gooden wrote.

""Covenant House and other federally funded NGOs must provide accountability and allow oversight from Congress. Failure to do so will result in swift action in the form of subpoenas.""

Gooden's letter does not indicate when Ibarra allegedly used the Covenant House address in New York. It is not uncommon for migrants who first arrive in the U.S. to list a shelter as their place of residence.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

FIRST ON FOX: A bicameral coalition of more than 130 Republican lawmakers penned a letter to the White House on Thursday, urging it to withdraw proposed tailpipe emissions regulations, forcing a transition to electric vehicles (EV).

The Republicans — led by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho — argued that the regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are a ""de facto EV mandate"" phaseout of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. They addressed the letter to President Biden and Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, which is expected to soon finalize the regulations.

""President Biden has made his intentions clear,"" Feenstra said in a statement. ""He would rather force American families — who are already facing financial hardship under the weight of inflation spurred by trillions in wasteful government spending — to buy electric vehicles to advance his Green New Deal agenda than allow folks to choose the best car or truck for their families, businesses, and farms at an affordable price.""

""This misguided decision also strengthens China while weakening our economy because the critical materials needed to manufacture electric vehicles are primarily sourced from China,"" the Iowa lawmaker added. ""Alongside Senator Mike Crapo, I’m proud to lead nearly 140 of my colleagues in urging President Biden to withdraw the proposed rule that would attempt to replace liquid fuels and combustion engines with unreliable and unaffordable electric vehicles.""

BIDEN ADMIN REPORTEDLY DOUBLING DOWN ON GAS CAR CRACKDOWN

Feenstra added that stories of Americans stranded in the cold waiting for their EV to charge during the winter provided further evidence that mandating EVs nationwide is ""ridiculous.""

Overall, under the proposal, which EPA unveiled in April 2023, the White House projected that 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases would be electric by 2032. In addition, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck, 35% of short-haul freight tractor and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could also be electric by then.

The White House said at the time that the tailpipe emissions proposal, which represents the most aggressive proposal of its kind ever proposed, would ""accelerate the clean vehicle transition"" and reduce oil imports by 20 billion barrels.

17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH

However, the proposal has faced widespread opposition from Republicans, as well as some Democrats and energy industry groups who say it will reduce consumer choice, lead to higher prices and benefit China, which dominates the EV battery supply chain. In December, the House voted 221-197, with five Democrats joining 216 Republicans, to pass a resolution nixing the EPA's proposal, but that bill has yet to receive a Senate vote.

""The reality is that most Americans still prefer the internal combustion engine vehicle, and EPA’s proposed rule unnecessarily restricts consumer choice and forces expensive EVs onto Americans at a time when they can least afford it,"" Feenstra, Crapo and the other Republicans wrote in their letter on Thursday.

""Major U.S. automakers have recently lowered their targets and pulled back planned investments in EVs due to low consumer demand and struggling EV units,"" they continued. ""Further, automobile dealers across the country have said EVs continue to sit unpurchased on dealership lots, despite automakers accepting massive losses and unsustainable government incentives.""

Late last year, thousands of auto dealers nationwide, including dealers in all 50 states and who collectively sell every major car brand, called on Biden to rescind the EPA proposal. They warned that, while some consumers are happy with EVs, demand is not keeping pace with supply and their lots are filling up with unwanted EVs.

VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE'

Further, the Republicans argued the Biden administration's proposal would make the U.S. more dependent on foreign supply chains, particularly those established in China. According to the International Energy Agency, China produces about 75% of all lithium-ion batteries and boasts 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% for anodes, two key parts of such batteries.

""Consequences of rules and regulations driven by the Biden Administration’s radical green agenda drastically reduce consumer choice and the affordability of vehicles available to Americans,"" said Crapo. ""Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable vehicles fueled by American-made energy products, not those primarily supplied by China.""

According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents several major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrid, up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.

At the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000.

In addition to Crapo, 23 other members of the Senate signed the letter, including Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Ranking Member John Barrasso, R-Wyo. Additionally, 113 House members signed the letter, including GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing JBS USA, the world's largest producer of beef, over the company's emissions and for ""greenwashing"" by allegedly misleading the public about its environmental impact.

In an announcement, James noted that beef production has the largest greenhouse gas footprint of any major food commodity and that animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. According to James, JBS USA's various net-zero pledges for 2030 and 2040 are therefore misleading and ""not feasible"" given the scope of its worldwide beef production operations.

""As families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis, they are willing to spend more of their hard-earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment,"" James said in a statement. ""When companies falsely advertise their commitment to sustainability, they are misleading consumers and endangering our planet.""

""JBS USA’s greenwashing exploits the pocketbooks of everyday Americans and the promise of a healthy planet for future generations,"" she added. ""My office will always ensure that companies do not abuse the environment and the trust of hardworking consumers for profit.""

GOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING UN FOR CALLING ON AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT

The lawsuit was applauded by state Democrats and national climate advocacy organizations like Earthjustice, Mighty Earth, Friends of the Earth US, Citizens Campaign for the Environment and Stand.earth.

""JBS repeatedly claims that it will reach net zero by 2040. This claim was found to be misleading and yet JBS continues to assert it,"" said Peter Lehner, an attorney at Earthjustice. ""While it is critical for every company to reduce its climate change impact, JBS would need to implement enormous operational changes to achieve this goal. However, JBS is doing very little and is not taking anywhere close to the steps that would be required.""

UN CLIMATE SUMMIT SERVING GOURMET BURGERS, BBQ AS IT CALLS FOR AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT

In her announcement and lawsuit, James pointed to several instances in which JBS USA and its executives made pledges to reduce the company's impact on the environment. She also stated the company — which has a market cap of more than $10 billion and whose North American beef business earns tens of billions of dollars annually — has acknowledged consumers are more interested in sustainable products.

For example, in March 2021, JBS announced a pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 across global operations and including indirect downstream emissions. The company then began a publicity campaign touting the pledge, running a full-page advertisement one month later in The New York Times stating ""it's possible"" for meat production to be ""part of the climate solution.""

Since then, JBS and its subsidiaries have continued to tout the 2040 pledge and other sustainability goals. The company even presented at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai late last year, announcing additional sustainability initiatives and investments.

TWO DOZEN REPUBLICANS CALL ON BIDEN TO DISAVOW JOHN KERRY'S REMARKS TARGETING FOOD PRODUCTION

""JBS takes its commitment to a more sustainable future for agriculture very seriously,"" JBS USA spokesperson Nikki Richardson said in an email to Fox News Digital. ""We disagree with the action taken today by the New York Attorney General’s office.""

""JBS will continue to partner with farmers, ranchers and our food system partners around the world to help feed a growing population while using fewer resources and reducing agriculture’s environmental impact,"" she continued. ""Our belief that American agriculture can help sustainably feed the world is undeterred.""

James' lawsuit comes as environmental groups and lawmakers worldwide increasingly set their sights on the agriculture industry. The global food system — which includes land-use change, actual agricultural production, packaging and waste management — generates about 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of 34% of total worldwide emissions, according to a 2021 study published in the Nature Food journal.

President Biden's international climate envoy John Kerry warned last year that decarbonization would be impossible without a concerted effort from the agriculture industry to achieve green goals.

""We can't get to net-zero, we don't get this job done unless agriculture is front and center as part of the solution. So all of us understand here the depths of this mission,"" Kerry said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Supreme Court expressed strong concerns on Monday about the sweep of state laws restricting how large social media companies moderate user content, a digital free speech case with implications in the political and business arenas.

Separate laws that passed in Florida and Texas and are now challenged in court would require Big Tech companies like X, formerly Twitter, and Facebook to host third-party communications but prevent those businesses from blocking or removing users' posts based on political viewpoints.

The regulations aim to address what some lawmakers call ""censoring"" of conservative messages, and banning politicians, like former President Trump, for violating subjective policies over offensive or ""problematic"" content.

But tech firms claim a First Amendment right as private entities to editorially regulate the billions of daily voices on their platforms — from political discourse and recipe sharing, to incitement and obscenity.

GOP AGS ASK SUPREME COURT TO PEEL BACK CONTENT MODERATION FROM BIG TECH IN LANDMARK FIRST AMENDMENT CASES

Justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum openly questioned whether the regulations would make it impossible for private companies to operate as a forum for free speech and expression.

""It covers almost everything,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor of Florida's law, which she said would affect what the arts and crafts retailer Etsy would have to allow on its digital marketplace. ""That's viewpoint discrimination. This falls under a whole lot of your listings and bans and disclosure requirements. Why are we imposing that on something like this?""

""The First Amendment restricts what the government can do,"" Chief Justice John Roberts told Texas' solicitor general. ""What the government’s doing here is saying 'you must do this, you must carry these people — you’ve got to explain if you don’t.' That’s not the First Amendment.""

But there was widespread unease about the best approach they should take at this stage.

Some justices suggested large companies that host wide-ranging speech platforms may be able to exercise greater editorial control, but that e-commerce sites like Etsy, Venmo, and Uber could be regulated by the states to some extent.

""This is a sprawling statute and it makes me a little bit nervous,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, over how a court opinion could be applied across the infinite variety of digital media. She said the competing interests ""had a bunch of landmines.""

Others on the bench wondered what the effect the big tech companies have on public discourse.

""There's a lot of new terminology bouncing around in these cases, and just out of curiosity — and one of them is content moderation,"" said Justice Samuel Alito. ""is it anything more a euphemism for censorship?""

JAN 6 RIOTERS, ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS: A LOOK AHEAD AT LANDMARK CASES SCOTUS WILL HEAR IN 2024

Alito also warned about resisting ""the Orwellian temptation to recategorize offensive conduct in seemingly bland terms.""

The Florida law would block a social media platform from engaging in censoring, prioritizing, or so-called ""shadow banning"" ""based on the content."" It also would prevent ""willfully deplatforming a candidate"" for public office for material posted by or about that candidate.

Both Florida and Texas would also require those companies to notify a user when their content has been modified or edited, along with an explanation for that action.

The states argue social media companies have outsized influence over what news and information the public sees, and say they have a long tradition of ensuring their citizens have full access to a range of viewpoints, calling social media platforms the new ""digital public square.""

The Florida and Texas laws were passed shortly after Twitter/X and Facebook separately removed Trump for their platforms, for his posts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots by his supporters.

Trump and a coalition of Republican-led states are among those filing separate amicus briefs supporting Florida and Texas

The Biden administration has opposed the state laws.

GOP SENATOR URGES SCOTUS TO REIN IN BIG TECH'S CONTENT CENSORSHIP THAT DEFIES 'LOGIC'

Trade groups representing big tech companies told the court the laws violate their free speech rights to decide what content meets their policies — saying their forums should not be an open-ended portal for offensive or dangerous speech — including school bullying, harassment, terrorist ideology, racial hatred, medical misinformation and voter fraud.

In almost four hours of oral arguments stretching well into the afternoon, the justices weighed whether to offer a sweeping ruling on the First Amendment implications of the state laws, or a more limited approach that might have the lower courts take another look at how those content moderation policies would be applied.

""Why isn't that a classic First Amendment violation for the state to come in and say, 'We're not going to allow you to enforce those sorts of restrictions?'"" asked Justice Elena Kagan.

""In your opening remarks,' Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked of Florida's Solicitor General Henry Whitaker, ""you said the design of the First Amendment is to prevent ‘suppression of speech.’ And you left out what I understand to be three key words in the First Amendment or to describe the First Amendment, 'by the government,'"" with Kavanaugh suggesting private companies should be given broader latitude to moderate their users content.

Attorneys for the states told the court that social media companies lack free speech protection since they only ""host"" viewpoints, similar to the telecommunications industry — known as ""common carriers"" — which transmits speech with no editorial oversight.

""Separating the wheat from the chaff here is pretty difficult,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch.

Justice Clarence Thomas, who light-heartedly noted he was the only member of the court who pre-dated the widespread use of the Internet was especially animated in his extensive bench remarks on the implications, asking tough questions of both sides.

""What do you do if it's a deep-learning algorithm which teaches itself and has very little human intervention?"" he asked at one point. ""So who's speaking then, the algorithm or the person?""

After the arguments, Florida Gov. Ron De Santis — on Twitter/X no less — said, ""We're gonna make sure we're doing everything we can to ensure people have a right to speak in these public forums. We want more speech, not less speech.""

These cases are just the latest in what is shaping up a busy term on the digital front at the Supreme Court.

The justices in March will hear an appeal from GOP-controlled states over whether federal government efforts to combat disinformation online violate the free speech rights of users on social media platforms.

Here too, those states say conservative political views are being silenced, after pressure on social media firms by the Biden administration.

And the justices have already heard arguments over whether public officials can block critical comments on their social media accounts from constituents.

Rulings in the cases argued Monday, Moody v. NetChoice, LLC and NetChoice, LLC v. Paxton, are expected by late June.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Former President Donald Trump claims that his wife Melania is expected to make more regular public appearances on the campaign trail.

Trump made the remarks during his interview at a Fox News townhall earlier this week with host Laura Ingraham.

""It’s funny, she was a very successful model, very, very successful, and yet she was a private person. She’s going to be out a lot. Not because she likes doing it, but she likes the results,"" he said Tuesday. ""She wants to see this country really succeed. She loves the country.""

""You know, a lot of first ladies would go out — they want to be everywhere. They get angry at their husband because he’s not introducing them,"" Trump continued. ""If I didn’t introduce Melania, she’d be very happy about it. She’s just a different kind of a person.""

Melania has been largely absent from her husband's 2024 presidential bid thus far, making few public appearances and staying out of the media.

Her absence, until recently, has been explained by the passing of her mother, Amalija Knavs, earlier this year. But as the campaign season becomes more intense, political commentators have questioned whether she will step back into efforts supporting Trump.

Trump also expressed appreciation that Melania has been dedicated to raising their son, Barron Trump.

""Her life revolves around that boy. It’s so important to her,"" Trump said. ""At the same time, it also revolves around our country and the success of our country. She’s raised a lot of money for charity. She’s a private person.""

""And she loves the country,"" Trump added. ""She’s going to be out a lot, but she does it for the good of the country, not for her. She’s somebody with a lot of confidence. She doesn’t need that.""

Trump's Fox News town hall came four days before South Carolina's Republican presidential primary, which commences Saturday.

The latest public opinion polls indicate that he maintains a very large double-digit lead over former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last major rival for the GOP nomination.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden told reporters on Wednesday that his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center went ""great,"" tamping down concerns over his health as the presidential election draws near.

Biden had just finished delivering remarks on how his administration’s policies on fighting crime in communities across the country are working when one reporter can be heard shouting if there’s anything Americans should know following his annual doctor’s visit.

""Well, they think I look too young,"" Biden replied.

Biden assured reporters that ""everything’s great"" regarding the check-up and that ""there is nothing different than last year.""

JACK SMITH RESPONDS TO BLISTERING HUR REPORT FOR FIRST TIME, SAYS BIDEN, TRUMP CASES NOT SIMILAR

Biden had revealed earlier Wednesday that he was making an unannounced trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a physical exam.

The exam comes after the report from Special Counsel Robert Hur that claimed the president had significant memory issues.

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, does not believe a cognitive test is necessary. She said O'Connor believes Biden proves his cognitive ability ""every day [in] how he operates and how he thinks.""

EX-OBAMA AIDES SAY AGE IS ‘VERY REAL ISSUE’ FOR BIDEN, WHO SOUNDS ‘FRAIL,’ ‘MUMBLY’

Biden received his last physical on Feb. 16 of last year, when his physician gave him a clean bill of health in a letter that said Biden was ""fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.""

Biden has undergone yearly physical examinations since the beginning of his term, in line with every other commander in chief since President Richard Nixon.

The Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the Global Times, touted President Biden and his campaign's use of TikTok, and critiqued the ""deep hypocrisy"" of America's politicians who call the social media platform a national security threat.

The opinion article in the CCP's state media said that Biden's campaign use of TikTok ""highlights the unjust suppression"" and ""proves the hype nonsense.""

""As a social media app that has been heavily portrayed by the US as a ‘national security threat,' TikTok being used by Biden's campaign highlights the unjust suppression of TikTok by American politicians and proves the hype nonsense,"" the article said.

BIG TECH FACES BRUTAL QUESTIONING ON CAPITOL HILL OVER CONTENT HARMING KIDS

The Global Times argued that the short-form video social media platform has become a ""necessary means"" for American politicians to reach young voters.

Citing a 2023 survey report by the Pew Research Center, the Global Times said that about one-third (32 percent) of young Americans aged 18 to 29 say they regularly get their news from TikTok.

The CCP newspaper said that American politicians are ""very self-contradictory when it comes to TikTok.""

The article argued that the Biden campaign's use of TikTok proves that the social media platform is not a national security threat and proves the ""deep hypocrisy"" of American politicians.

""In the end, we are witnessing that Washington's behavior toward TikTok is unacceptable to the public and society, so politicians have to choose to compromise for votes,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.

Jake Denton, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center, told Fox News Digital that Biden's ""hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats"" posed by TikTok.

President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America. — Jake Denton, Research Associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center

""Once again, President Biden's insatiable hunger for votes has blinded him to the national security threats facing America,"" Denton said. ""By choosing to use TikTok for his reelection campaign, he is callously disregarding warnings from both parties and national security experts that this Chinese-controlled technology imperils our national security through invasive data gathering and its ties to the CCP.""

""We cannot let one man’s thirst for social media virality and votes endanger our country,"" Denton said. ""The President must put America before his personal electoral interests, immediately delete TikTok, and join the bipartisan efforts to ban the app from operating on American soil.""

The Biden campaign's TikTok video sparked outrage after the administration banned the Chinese-owned app from federal devices over security concerns.

TIKTOK CEO GRILLED ON CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY INFLUENCE, SEARCHES OF TAYLOR SWIFT VS. TIANANMEN SQUARE

Last February, the administration set a 30-day deadline for government agencies to purge the app from federal devices.

The social media platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is popular among younger Americans.

Biden previously joined forces with TikTok influencers amid his re-election run, and the Democratic National Committee also joined the platform.

The president's campaign joining the Beijing-based social media platform could present unique security risks.

The Senate passed a stopgap measure Thursday night to avoid a government shutdown, which would have begun on Saturday, the first funding deadline for appropriations bills as laid out in the previous two-pronged spending bill.

Senators voted 77-13 to pass the continuing resolution, making the chamber aligned with the House. The bill now goes to President Biden to sign.

The continuing resolution passed the House earlier in the day, by a vote of 320-99. The bill moves funding deadlines to March 8 and March 22, rather than March 1 and March 8 initially agreed upon.

""We are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., said in a joint statement on Wednesday, along with House Appropriations Committee Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine.

According to the lawmakers, six funding bills each for Agriculture-FDA, Commerce-Justice and Science, Energy and Water Development, Interior, Military Construction-VA, and Transportation-HUD will be taken up for votes and enacted ahead of the first deadline on March 8.

Negotiators are in agreement on the first six measures, which will be guided by both the Fiscal Responsibility Act discretionary spending limits, as well as the January topline spending agreement, per the statement. The deal laid out a $1.6 trillion topline amount for spending in the fiscal year, with $886 billion allotted for defense spending and $704 billion for non-defense purposes.

An additional slate of six bills, including those for Defense, Financial Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS, Legislative Branch, and State and Foreign Operations, are set to be agreed upon, taken up for votes, and signed into law ahead of the later March 22 deadline.

The latest continuing resolution is the fourth such extension since the Congress's failure to pass separate appropriations bills by the Sept. 30 deadline. It now heads to President Biden's desk for a signature to avoid a partial shutdown at midnight on Friday.

EXCLUSIVE: Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican leader, is endorsing former President Trump for reelection.

It’s a key win for Trump from the establishment wing of the Republican Party. The South Dakota Republican is Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s top deputy in the Senate GOP.

""The primary results in South Carolina make clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president in this year’s pivotal presidential election. The choice before the American people is crystal clear: It’s Donald Trump or Joe Biden,"" Thune told Fox News Digital.

TRUMP MOVES CLOSER TO LOCKING UP GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WITH 20-POINT WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA

""I support former President Trump's campaign to win the presidency, and I intend to do everything I can to see that he has a Republican majority in the Senate working with him to restore American strength at home and abroad,"" he continued.

""Together we must put an end to the disastrous Biden-Schumer agenda. Our country cannot endure another four years of Bidenomics, continued lawlessness at our southern border, and American weakness on the global stage.""

Thune and Trump spoke by phone on Saturday night after Trump’s commanding victory in the South Carolina Republican primary, a source familiar with the call told Fox News Digital.

It wasn’t clear before now whether Thune, who’s seen as one of McConnell’s potential successors to lead the Senate Republican Conference, would endorse either of the two major candidates for the 2024 GOP nomination.

ONLY ON FOX: WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT HALEY AFTER TOPPING HER IN HER HOME STATE

Like McConnell, he suggested he would support whoever Republican voters chose as their presidential nominee, but Thune has for the most part avoided mentioning the former president.

He previously endorsed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott’s presidential campaign and was present at Scott’s launch event. Scott dropped out in November and endorsed Trump last month.

The Sunday announcement puts added pressure on McConnell, who has brushed off scrutiny on whether his frosty relationship with Trump would stop him from endorsing the ex-president in the Republican primary.

McConnell said at a press conference this month when asked about the race, ""I've stayed essentially out of it, and when I change my mind about that, I'll let you know.""

Both Thune and McConnell were targeted by Trump for criticizing his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and the 2020 election.

Thune won a landslide reelection victory for a fourth Senate term in 2022 despite Trump calling for a primary challenger against him.

His endorsement of the former president comes after Trump beat former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state primary on Saturday night. The ex-president won roughly 60% of the vote compared to 40% for Haley.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

FIRST ON FOX: A House Republican who has been critical of rushing to impeach President Biden is calling for his removal over questions about his mental fitness for the job.

Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told Fox News Digital that he plans to introduce a resolution on Monday to call on Biden’s Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution.

His most-cited reason was Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents. The report did not recommend any charges for the president but repeatedly painted him as an aging leader with a poor memory.

Buck said the report ""addressed what many Americans have long witnessed with their own eyes – that President Biden is no longer fit to successfully discharge the critical duties of his office.""

JAMES BIDEN SAYS HIS BROTHER 'HAS NEVER HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT' OR ANY 'FINANCIAL INTEREST' IN BUSINESS VENTURES

""Numerous instances were articulated in the report, and have played out in full public view, showing President Biden’s apparent cognitive decline and lack of mental stamina,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""The societal challenges and security threats our country faces are innumerable and require a chief executive with both strong mental and physical faculties. The time has come for the vice president and the Cabinet to put our country first and move forward on invoking the 25th Amendment.""

DEVON ARCHER: HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA EXECS ‘CALLED DC’ TO GET UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR FIRED

In his resolution text, Buck also cited Biden’s verbal stumbles and public gaffes as evidence of mental decline. It pointed out that Biden recently confused French President Emmanuel Macron with a predecessor who died decades prior, and that he also mixed up German leaders’ names and mistakenly referred to the president of Egypt as the president of Mexico.

Biden and his allies have vigorously denied that his mental acuity is suffering.

But Buck’s resolution is a significant addition to the growing pressure for Biden officials to address scrutiny over the president’s mental fitness.

The Colorado Republican, who is retiring at the end of this term, is one of the few House GOP lawmakers who have publicly expressed wariness over the push to impeach Biden over allegations that he and his family’s businesses profited off of his political weight.

Buck voted along with the rest of the House GOP Conference to formalize the Biden impeachment inquiry in December, but just last week he criticized the probe’s leaders for relying on allegations made by FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who was recently indicted for lying to the bureau.

""We’ve always been looking for a link between what Hunter Biden received in terms of money and Joe Biden’s activities or Joe Biden receiving money. This clearly is not a credible link at this point,"" Buck said in a CNN interview.

He told the network in September, ""I want to make sure we don’t ruin this institution over a tit-for-tat impeachment. If the evidence is there… I will absolutely vote for impeachment. I don’t see the evidence at this point.""

Section 4 of the 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the White House Cabinet to declare the president unfit to perform his duties, transferring power to the vice president.

The president is able to take those powers back by writing to Congress that he is able to serve. The Cabinet would then have four days to refute that, after which Congress would vote on whether the president could remain in power.

A town hall hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.

The socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.

""My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I'm running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,"" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER

""They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.""

NYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.

Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.

Another man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.

""Secure the border now,"" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.

""You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.""

""You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.""

""That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.""

The man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting ""AOC, AOC,"" and clapping their hands.

The man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.

As Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: ""Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.""

He then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.

""You only represent the illegal aliens.""

Well clearly I don't, because I'm an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,"" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.

After the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.

""Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.""

""We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.""

Her comments were met with applause and a woman shouted ""thank you.""

""We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

The hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.

While illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote. New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022 but it was ruled illegal several months later and an appeal to the ruling was denied by a New York state appeals court.

Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis has found .

New York City has provided for more than 178,600 migrants since the spring of 2022 with approximately 65,000 still in the city’s care, according to the mayor’s office.

President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers ""neanderthals.""

Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres.

""I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,"" Biden said. ""Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.""

""The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,"" he added. ""I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.""

Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party.

""Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,"" he said at the time. ""None of this is inevitable.""

After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation.

""This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.""

""The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'"" Biden added. ""That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.

He urged former President Trump to ""join me"" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill.

Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas.

""This is a Joe Biden invasion,"" Trump said of the border crisis.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Colorado state legislature advanced a bill on Friday aimed at mandating K-12 schools statewide to implement policies requiring educators to address transgender students by their preferred name in all school settings – including in records and documents – independent of parental approval or a formal legal name change.

The bill will need one more round of voting before advancing to the Senate floor.

House Bill 1039 — a bill largely backed by the progressive group Colorado Youth Advisory Council — would also impact charter schools and mandates that educators use students' non-legal names in all school-related functions, including extracurricular activities, rosters, attendance lists, yearbooks and student ID cards.

In its proposal to lawmakers, the youth council said many ""school administrative systems cause humiliation for transgender Colorado youth when schools use the students’ deadnames (birth names that do not align with their gender identities).""

INDIANA PARENTS WARN NATION AFTER CHILD IS REMOVED FROM HOME FOR IMPROPER PRONOUN USAGE: ‘CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE’

""When schools keep a student’s former name and gender marker on school transcripts and records, it outs transgender students to their peers, thereby violating their privacy,"" the group wrote prior to the legislature's vote.

One Colorado, a progressive LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, also supports the bill, alongside the Colorado School Counselors Association.

The bill would also deem that ""intentional use of a name other than a student's chosen name is discriminatory.""

State Rep. Anthony Hartsook, a Republican, called the bill ""open-ended and ill-defined"" that could lead to ""many, many paths.""

""We open up Pandora's Box for discernment on what is discriminatory and what is not, what is intentional and what is not,"" Hatsook said on the House floor. ""Who starts deciding that when and where do we start deciding that? When and where do we bring the parents into that discussion?""

CAMPUS RELIGIOUS GROUPS REPORT GREATER INTEREST FROM STUDENTS TRYING TO FIND MEANING IN ‘CRUMBLING’ CULTURE

Republican State Rep. Brandi Bradley agreed with Hartsook and urged colleagues to vote ""no"" on the legislation.

""And now we have told the teachers that they're being discriminatory,"" Bradley said of the bill. ""I have four teenagers. They are awesome kids, but sometimes they like to play games. So tell me how codifying or putting this bill in is not going to go against teachers and their rights in a field where we already have so much shortage?""

Republican State Rep. Rose Pugliese added she does not want schools to know more about her kids than she does.

""Parents have the right to know,"" said Pugliese.

Other Republican lawmakers argued students would be allowed to change their names more than once, furthering burdening teachers to remember their new names.

Meanwhile, State Rep. Stephanie Vigil, a Colorado Springs Democrat co-sponsoring the bill, contended that some transgender kids who may not have come out to their parents yet would be in danger if the legislation is not approved. On the other hand, parents who support their transgender children would also have their parental rights usurped if they approve of the name change.

RESEARCHERS ARGUE ‘RAPID ONSET GENDER DYSPHORIA’ DOES EXIST, DESPITE NARRATIVE AGAINST IT

""And so I would just suggest to you all as we talk through this bill today that we bear in mind that there is such a thing as a kid who's not safe with their own parents,"" said Vigil. ""Certainly, kids belong with their parents – that relationship is precious. But I do not accept the premise that a child is anyone's property or that their safety isn't to be prioritized, even when the person who is a danger to them is their own parents.""

The bill was also sponsored by Democratic State Sens. Faith Winter, of Westminster, and Janice Marchman, of Loveland. State Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat and the legislature's only transgender member, is also a co-sponsor.

If cleared by the Senate and signed by the governor, the bill would go into effect in July 2025.

Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah are several states that have passed laws restricting pronoun use in schools.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Ahead of President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday, the White House debuted a new term for illegal immigrants arriving in the country, calling them ""newcomers.""

Biden will travel to Brownsville, Texas, in an effort to reassure voters who have soured on his handling of the border crisis. Republicans have lambasted the Biden administration for weak enforcement of immigration laws, and a recent poll showed that just 26% of Americans approved of the president's job on immigration.

The language the White House used to describe the crisis may not alleviate voters' concerns. In a fact sheet distributed by the White House press office to advocate for the bipartisan border agreement Biden has endorsed, officials pointed out that the bill includes $1.4 billion ""for cities and states who are providing critical services to newcomers.""

BIDEN'S BORDER VISIT LANDS ON ONE OF THE LEAST TRAFFICKED TOWNS, WHILE TRUMP IS HEADED INTO THE THICK OF IT

The reference to illegal immigrants as ""newcomers"" — which suggests equal status to migrants who come to the U.S. legally — provoked a swift condemnation from House Republicans.

""The Biden White House is now referring to illegal immigrants as ‘newcomers.’ Joe Biden is not serious about stopping the illegal immigration into the United States. This is a catastrophe by design,"" the House GOP conference posted on X.

White House officials have shot back at their GOP critics several times in recent weeks, asserting that if Republican lawmakers were serious about securing the border, they would support the bipartisan legislation President Biden has endorsed.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATIONS OF 36 STATES

The border bill negotiated in the Senate would increase Border Patrol staff and tighten asylum rules, expand law enforcement's authority to tackle fentanyl smuggling and increase funding to cities and states receiving asylum seekers.

Republicans argued the bill would normalize high levels of illegal immigration and do little to stop the flow of people and drugs over the border.

""We have done the work to make sure we're dealing with a broken immigration system. The Republicans have gotten in the way. They have gotten in the way,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday on CNN.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

""And so look, this is a serious matter, that‘s why the president is going to the border. The president was at the border a year ago in El Paso, visiting the border back in January 2023. He put a comprehensive, a comprehensive immigration policy on day one,"" she added.

Biden's choice of Brownsville for his border visit is an area that has seen comparatively small numbers of migrant crossings in Texas.

CBP data shows that Brownsville has seen just 46 migrant encounters over the past five days, compared to 2,106 in Eagle Pass. The former averaged 17 migrant encounters per day in February, while the latter averaged 462.

Brownsville is part of the CBP's Rio Grande Valley sector, which has seen 87,426 migrant encounters so far in FY 2024. The Del Rio sector that encompasses Eagle Pass has seen 182,077 encounters, but even that is far below the busiest sector, which lies around Tucson, Arizona, and has seen 297,380 encounters.

Former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, will visit Eagle Pass on Thursday in a competing visit, one of the most heavily trafficked areas in Texas and ground zero for Gov. Greg Abbott's fight with the Biden administration over enforcing immigration law.

Hur's report recommended no charges against Biden over his actions pertaining to the mishandling of classified documents, partly because he would have a defense at trial as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""

Republicans piled on Biden following the Hur report's release last week, but Democrats have also begun voicing — or at least admitting — greater concern surrounding Biden's age and whether that could hurt his chances at winning re-election this year.

Former President Bill Clinton's lead strategist, James Carville, argued Saturday that the White House has little confidence in Biden after he turned down a Super Bowl Sunday interview.

""It’s the biggest television audience, not even close, and you get a chance to do a 20-25-minute interview on that day,"" Carville said. ""And you don’t do it? That’s a kind of sign that the staff, or yourself, doesn’t have much confidence in you. There’s no other way to read this.""

Another former Clinton strategist, Paul Begala, said Hur’s indictment of Biden’s memory and Biden's subsequent response was ""terrible for Democrats.""

""Oh yeah. Look, I’m a Biden supporter, and I slept like a baby last night: I woke up every two hours crying and wet the bed,"" Begala quipped on CNN last Friday. ""This is terrible for Democrats. And anybody with a functioning brain knows that,"" he declared.

Also ahead of the Hur report's release, former Secretary of State and 2016 Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton admitted Biden's age was ""a legitimate issue.""

The Biden administration finalized energy efficiency regulations targeting residential clothes washers and dryers in an effort to curb carbon emissions, as part of its broad climate agenda.

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced the final rules, which it projected will collectively save American households $2.2 billion per year on utility bills while reducing nearly 71 million metric tons of ""dangerous carbon dioxide emissions"" over the next three decades. DOE's regulations targeting the popular home appliances are slightly scaled down compared to the agency's draft proposal issued a year ago.

""For decades, DOE’s appliance standards actions for clothes washers and dryers have provided loads of savings for American families while also decreasing harmful carbon emissions,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.

""With strong support from industry leaders and consumer advocates, DOE will continue to roll out innovative appliance solutions throughout 2024 to lower costs for the American people — continuing the cycle of household savings that are the backbone of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,"" she continued.

BIDEN ADMIN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TARGETING HOME APPLIANCES WITH ECO REGULATIONS IN 2023

Under the regulations, certain less-efficient models of washers and dryers will be barred from being sold, according to DOE.

The clothes washers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 0.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 3% compared to the profile of models currently on the market. And the dryers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 2.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 11% compared to products on the market now.

DOE said the regulations largely reflect an agreement issued in September by environmental groups and industry associations.

""Standards at these levels will significantly reduce household energy bills and planet-warming emissions, period,"" Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said after the agreement was reached at the time.

""Swiftly establishing standards at these strong levels will allow the Department of Energy to continue to make progress with the highly successful efficiency standards program — which already saves the average household $500 annually on their energy bills,"" added Natural Resources Defense Council staff attorney Joe Vukovich.

BIDEN ADMIN'S WAR ON HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES WILL CAUSE HIGHER PRICES, DIRTIER CLOTHES AND DISHES, EXPERTS WARN

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) — which heavily criticized DOE's original proposal last year on washers and dryers — also signed onto the agreement. AHAM CEO Kelly Mariotti said in September that the compromise regulations would allow ""manufacturers to continue to offer a complete range of energy-efficient products.""

""What we're learning is that the government ought to get out of the business of doing these regulations,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""And not try to just float really extreme ones and then come up with something that's less extreme.""

""The main concern with these negotiated rulemakings is that it mostly involves the manufacturers and the energy efficiency activists,"" he added. ""One wonders how much the interests of consumers are taken into account during this process.""

The new standards for washers and dryers, meanwhile, are the latest in a long string of energy efficiency regulations unveiled by DOE over the last 12 months. Climate activists have argued such regulations are necessary to combat global warming, noting that the commercial and residential sector accounts for the largest share of total end-use carbon emissions of any sector in the U.S.

However, Republican lawmakers and free market advocates have argued the rules restrict consumer choice and lead to increased upfront costs.

""DOE should be looking for ways to address the problems caused by the existing washing machine regulations rather than making things worse with tougher new regulations,"" Lieberman told Fox News Digital.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Catch me at the border

President Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday reflects his wishful thinking on the issue, arriving at one of the least-trafficked towns on the border.

Biden will visit Brownsville, Texas, which ranks as the 29th-most trafficked town by illegal border-crossers, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Former President Trump, meanwhile, is set to hold a competing visit to the border, though he will arrive at Eagle Pass, Texas, one of the most heavily-trafficked towns in the country.

Biden's trip to Texas is an attempt to address his deep unpopularity on the issue, with a recent poll showing just 26% of Americans support his handling of the border.

The White House says Biden will use the visit to renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing at the border as well as tightening asylum rules, moved to tackle fentanyl smuggling, and increased funding to communities and NGOs receiving migrants. Republicans argued it fell well short of what is necessary.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee.

While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November.

Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says ""the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.""

""I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,"" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN'

Smith’s ""primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,"" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, ""there might not be a trial.""

Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a ""host"" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as ""motivated"" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall.

Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election.

HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF'

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Manual states, ""Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.

""Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,"" Turley said.

John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.



""If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,"" Shu said. ""It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial.

""The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.""

""This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,"" Shu added.

On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, ""Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.""

But, Turley said, ""the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.""

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE

""The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,"" Turley said.

""The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection.

""So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.""

Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said ""the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.""

""But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,"" Trusty said.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

A New York judge presiding over former President Donald Trump’s civil fraud case has denied his legal team’s request to avoid paying a $355 million penalty in the case.

Trump lawyers had asked Judge Arthur Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an ""orderly post-judgement process.""

In an email to the defendants posted Thursday to the court docket, Engoron said they had ""failed to explain, much less justify, any basis for a stay.""

""I am confident that the Appellate Division will protect your appellate rights,"" he wrote.

Last week, Trump was barred from operating his business in New York for three years and was found liable for $355 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

HAYLEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: ‘LET’S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

James said Monday she was prepared to seize Trump's assets if he is unable to pay the massive judgment handed down in his civil fraud case.

Trump could be at risk of losing some of his prized properties if he can't pay his staggering New York civil fraud penalty. With interest, he owes the state nearly $454 million — and the amount is going up $87,502 each day until he pays.

Engoron concluded that Trump lied for years about his wealth as he built the real estate empire that vaulted him to stardom and the White House. Trump denies wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal.

Trump's ability to pay his mounting legal debts is increasingly murky after back-to-back courtroom losses. In January, a jury ordered him to pay $83.3 million for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.

Trump claimed last year that he has about $400 million in cash — reserves that would get eaten up by his court penalties. The rest of his net worth, which he says is several billion dollars, is tied up in golf courses, skyscrapers, and other properties, along with investments and other holdings.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.""

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said.

Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer.

SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY

Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants.

NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,"" a spokesperson said. ""He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.""

Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S.

GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered ""no"" when asked if ""undocumented immigrants"" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials.

In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities.

But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are ""inherently more unsafe.""

""It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,"" he said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies.

""Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,"" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration.

""But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,"" he said.

""And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,"" he said.

There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel will formally resign her position after the March 5 Super Tuesday primaries, weeks after former President Trump asked her to step down.

The announcement comes weeks after Trump revealed his recommendations for changes within the RNC earlier this month. He proposed that North Carolina GOP chair Michael Whatley take over as chairman, while his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita also receive leadership positions.

""It has been the honor and privilege of my life to serve the Republican National Committee for seven years as Chairwoman to elect Republicans and grow our Party,"" McDaniel said in a statement. ""I have decided to step aside at our Spring Training on March 8 in Houston to allow our nominee to select a Chair of their choosing. The RNC has historically undergone change once we have a nominee and it has always been my intention to honor that tradition.""

""I remain committed to winning back the White House and electing Republicans up and down the ballot in November,"" she added, before thanking her husband, family and RNC staff.

As he has moved closer to securing the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has been ramping up his calls for changes and new leadership at the GOP's national party committee.

TRUMP RECOMMENDS NORTH CAROLINA GOP CHAIR WHATLEY TO REPLACE MCDANIEL AT RNC: SOURCE

The former president met with McDaniel at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida in early February.

Trump wrote in his Truth Social platform following the meeting that McDaniel was a ""friend"" but that he would be urging changes at the RNC after the Feb. 24 South Carolina GOP presidential primary.

McDaniel was nominated by Trump soon after his presidential election victory in 2016, and she won re-election in 2019, 2021, and January of last year.

Gov. Kathy Hochul has called on online map and social media companies to stop listing unlicensed cannabis dispensaries.

Yelp said the company believes ""consumers have a First Amendment right to read and write about all businesses, even if unlicensed.""

After failing to wipe illegal cannabis dispensaries off the map, New York is asking online sites to hide them.

Since the state legalized marijuana in 2021, unlicensed pot shops have proliferated across New York City, with limited pushback from authorities. On Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul called on online map and social media companies to stop listing them.

""If you type in ‘cannabis dispensaries’ in Google Maps or Yelp, you’ll get a long list of unlicensed illegal vendors,"" Hochul, a Democrat, said Tuesday, speaking to reporters alongside some of the owners of licensed, legal weed stores that make up a tiny minority of the cannabis shops in New York City.

FEDERAL JUDGE GREEN LIGHTS NEW YORK MARIJUANA LICENSING DESPITE 'DISASTER' LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET ROLLOUT

In a statement, Yelp said the company believes ""consumers have a First Amendment right to read and write about all businesses, even if unlicensed.""

""Allowing users to contribute and see information ... about unlicensed businesses serves the public interest and provides a resource for regulators to determine whether any particular business has appropriate licenses,"" the statement read.

Legal marijuana shops in New York pay a vice tax, purchase from local farms, and submit to quality control testing to ensure their products aren’t laced with other drugs and aren’t stronger or weaker than their label says.

NEW YORK GOV. KATHY HOCHUL PROPOSES LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL POT SHOPS

But so far, fewer than 80 cannabis licensed stores have opened around the state, where strict eligibility requirements and lawsuits have contributed to slowing the rollout. Meanwhile, it’s common for a single neighborhood in New York City to have a dozen illegal ones.

Hochul vowed to crack down eight months ago, but has failed to make noticeable progress.

Aiming to avoid an echo of prohibition-era criminalization of drug sales, New York state’s marijuana legalization doesn’t include severe criminal punishment for illegal sales and doesn’t allow most law enforcement agencies to enforce pot laws.

Legislation that Hochul signed last May gave the state powers for inspections, seizures, fines that can reach $20,000 a day and, in some cases, close shops and go after landlords.

But the governor on Wednesday said she has since learned that it wasn't enough. She said the fines aren't high enough to deter people, and noted the appeals process takes many months, allowing shops to continue raking in tax-free profits off unlicensed products that are less expensive because they can be purchased out of state.

New York City itself has tried to stem the tide by going after landlords, but Mayor Eric Adams has been imploring Albany to grant the city more power to respond.

Hochul has asked the Democrat-controlled state Legislature to pass new legislation to grant more enforcement authority to city agencies, increase fines, and give law enforcement permission to shut down illegal stores before the appeals process plays out.

In the meantime, Hochul is asking tech companies ""to not be posting the sites that are illegal and ensure that they’re posting the legal shops.""

Local cannabis entrepreneur Osbert Orduña said Google Maps keeps delisting his legal shops, one in New Jersey, and another in Queens, New York. He said he’s never had trouble with his listings on Yelp, though he’d like the site to delist illegal operators as well.

NEW YORK LAWMAKERS CONSIDER ADDING POT SHOP CRACKDOWN TO OVERDUE BUDGET

""Four times, Google has taken us down off of their platform for ‘violating their terms of service.’ We’ve done nothing other than have our store hours and our basic business information listed,"" he said.

Google didn't immediately respond to a query about Orduña's specific circumstances, but noted in a statement responding to Hochul's comments that it does remove listings for closed venues.

""If we can confirm that a business has closed for any reason – including license issues – we’ll reflect that it’s closed in the listing. We also prohibit cannabis ads in New York and remove them upon detection, often before they ever run,"" the statement read.

Orduña said he also wants his illegal competitors, some of whom he knows personally, to be closed down. He says they tell him he's playing a ""sucker's game."" But as a former Marine, he likes to do things by the book and even plans on expanding to open another store in Queens next week.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

""This is an open primary,"" Haley emphasized in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview this week.

The former two-term Palmetto State governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in the former president's administration notes that ""anybody can vote in the primary, as long as you didn't vote in the Democrat primary on February 3rd in South Carolina.""

LIVE UPDATES: SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRIMARY

Trump is the 2024 GOP frontrunner as he bids a third straight time for the White House. He grabbed a majority of the votes last month in Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary victories and won by a landslide earlier this month in the Nevada and U.S. Virgin Island caucuses to close in on locking up the nomination.

HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL WIN THE NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: ‘LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS'

The final polls in South Carolina showed Trump maintaining a large double-digit lead over Haley, the last remaining major rival challenging the former president.

Independents helped fuel Haley's 43% showing in New Hampshire, where she lost to Trump by 11 points. But while independent voters have long played a crucial and influential role in the first-in-the-nation primary, they are much less of a factor in South Carolina's more conservative electorate, where evangelical voters enjoy prominence in GOP contests.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS ‘A**-KICKING' FOR HALEY IN HER HOME STATE, BUT SHE SAYS ‘I REFUSE TO QUIT’

A Monmouth University poll about South Carolina's primary conducted last weekend had Trump with a 72%-to-25% lead among Republicans questioned, similar to how he performed with GOP voters in New Hampshire. Haley, meanwhile, held a narrow 53%-46% advantage among independents.

The problem for Haley is nearly two-thirds of those sampled by the survey indicated they were Republicans, with only 28% identifying as independents.

Longtime South Carolina-based Republican consultant Dave Wilson, who remains neutral in the primary, noted ""there is no party registration in this state.""

""They're targeting what would be considered independent or swing voters. There's just not that many in South Carolina. You're either an R or a D in this state,"" Wilson said, addressing Haley's campaign efforts.

He added the Haley campaign and aligned groups are ""trying to find people who are so against Donald Trump that they're willing to step into a Republican booth and choose her name just to vote against Trump.""

Haley's allies are also making a pitch for Democrats who didn't cast a ballot in the party's relatively low turnout presidential primary earlier this month to vote in the GOP contest.

HALEY ACCUSES TRUMP OF SIDING WITH A DICTATOR AND TYRANT'

""If you did not vote in the February 3rd Democratic primary, you are eligible to vote on February 24th."" a mailer sent to Democratic voters by the Haley-aligned super PAC SFA Fund states.

""Your vote can make a difference,"" the mailer emphasized. ""Please participate by voting for Nikki Haley and make your voice heard.""

Haley has repeatedly vowed to march on regardless of her finish on Saturday. Michigan, on Tuesday, holds the next contest, and it's also an open primary.

In early March, nearly 800 delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday, and over 150 will be at stake over the ensuing two weeks. Among the states holding contests on Super Tuesday are delegate-rich California and Texas, and other big states like Florida, Illinois and Ohio will hold winner-take-all primaries March 19. Polling in many of those states indicates Trump holding large leads over Haley.

But Haley's campaign notes that 11 of the 16 Super Tuesday contests aren't limited to registered Republicans.

Campaign manager Betsy Ankeny in a recent memo highlighted that the upcoming open primaries contain ""significant fertile ground for Nikki.""

Trump and his allies have repeatedly blasted Haley over the courting of independents and even some Democrats.

""The Democrats are giving her money, and she's playing into the game. And I think she just can't get, she just can't get herself to get out. She is doing poorly in the polls. Look, if she was doing well, I'd understand it, but she's doing very poorly,"" Trump said Tuesday in a Fox News town hall in Greenville, South Carolina.

Haley, in an interview the next morning on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom,"" fired back.

TRUMP RUNNING MATE AUDITIONS ON THE SOUTH CAROLINA CAMPAIGN TRAIL

""He can keep saying I have big Democrat donors. At the same time, look at his disclosures. But I don't ask donors whether they're Republican, Democrat or independent,"" she said.

""We're fighting for the Republican primary, but there are a lot of independents who left the Republican Party because of Donald Trump. We are pulling them back. … We're pulling Reagan Democrats back. And Republicans need to remember this is not about pushing people out of our party. And that's why I do well with everybody, not just Republicans, not just independents.""

Seasoned Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams pointed out that ""it's up to each state to choose its process. … That's generally been a principle of states' rights that Republicans have long supported.""

Williams, a veteran of Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, noted that when Romney won the nomination a dozen years ago ""we were essentially the establishment and tried to draw in independents to offset what seemed to be a rotation of conservative challengers.

""We courted independent voters, and we had an eye on the general election too,"" Williams recalled. ""We wanted to make sure we were drawing independents to vote for us in the primary who would hopefully stick around for the general election.""

Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties  Fox News,"Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat.

In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections.

Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination.

When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise.

The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot.

That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support.

ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT

As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex.

Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats.

TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION

Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady.

Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers.

""We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,"" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. ""The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.""

The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year.

The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress.

Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them.

""If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,"" Kim said.

Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017.

""I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,"" she said. ""I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.""

She added: ""Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.""

REPUBLICAN HOPES

The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972.

Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm.

GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES

Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people.

Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send ""ticked off"" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy.

A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November.

""We’ll come together,"" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. ""The threat from Republicans is too much.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.

The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a ""bump stock"" device is a ""machine gun"" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires ""automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.""

After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that ""bump stocks"" are machine guns.

The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.

GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES'

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several ""bump stocks"" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.

""It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,"" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.

But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.

The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.

""I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,"" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. ""And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.""

Justice Samuel Alito called that ""disturbing.""

""These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,"" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.""

A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.

TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE

As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will ""bump"" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.

Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.

The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.

GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT'

Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.

The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.

The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.

Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.

The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire ""automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""

Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.

""The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.""

After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, ""Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?""

But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.

""Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,"" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, ""but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?""

The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.

""This is totally confusing,"" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.

""Now I'm completely lost,"" added Sotomayor at one point.

Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

""If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,"" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president.

Supporters of the ban say it saves lives.

""Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,"" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. ""ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.""

A ruling is due by early summer.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The LAO laid out the grim forecast in a Tuesday report that cautions that a $24 billion ""erosion in revenues"" corresponds to a $15 billion increase in the state's budget problem. Due to this, the budget deficit, which last month was estimated to hit $58 billion, could now go as high as $73 billion.

""The actual increase in the state's budget problem will depend on a number of factors, including formula-driven spending changes, most notably Proposition 98 spending requirements for schools and community colleges,"" the report said.

H.D. Palmer, the deputy director of California's Department of Finance and Newsom's spokesperson on budget matters, responded to the new LAO report by telling Fox News Digital that their budget shortfall differs from the $38 billion they estimate.

""From now through April, more than $51 billion in income and corporate tax receipts are forecast to come in,"" Palmer said. ""No one can say today with certainty how those numbers may change the budget estimate of a $38 billion shortfall.""

""A responsible step would be for the Legislature to act now on the early action budget measures needed for $8 billion in solutions to help close this gap,"" he added.

California saw its first-ever population decline in 2020 when the state imposed rigid lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 2020 to July 2022, the state lost well over half a million people, with the number of residents leaving surpassing those moving in by almost 700,000.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said she was ""proud"" to cast a protest vote against President Biden in Michigan's Democratic primary on Tuesday.

Tlaib's comments were shared in a video by Listen To Michigan, a group dedicated to getting Democrats in the Great Lakes State to vote ""uncommitted"" in the primary election.

Biden's stance on Israel's war in Gaza has earned him fierce backlash from Arab American and Muslim community leaders, particularly in Michigan, which is home to one of the largest Muslim communities in the U.S.

""Hi everyone, it's Rashida. I was proud today to walk in and pull a Democratic ballot and vote uncommitted. We must protect our democracy, we must make sure that our government is about us, about the people,"" Tlaib said. ""When 74% of Democrats in Michigan support a ceasefire yet President Biden is not hearing us, this is the way we can use our democracy to say listen.""

TRUMP SAYS SOUTH CAROLINA IS 'BIGGER WIN THAN WE ANTICIPATED,' LOOKS FORWARD TO SAYING 'JOE, YOU'RE FIRED'

""Listen to the families right now that have been directly impacted, but also listen to majority of Americans that are saying enough. No more wars, no more using our dollars to fund a genocide. No more. So please, take your family members, use our democratic process to speak up about your core values, where you want to see our country go.""

Tlaib said it was the first time her 18-year-old son had voted in an election.

Progressive-led campaigns and lawmakers have hammered Biden's re-election campaign over the U.S.'s handling of the Middle East conflict.

In addition to Listen To Michigan, a group called Abandon Biden has been pushing voters to actively oppose the president for his failure to call for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza.

TRUMP 'REALLY NOT THINKING ABOUT' HALEY AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA VICTORY, SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON BEATING BIDEN

Abandon Biden is specifically targeting voters in swing states, which could prove critical in the 2024 race that is likely to pit Biden against his old political foe, former President Trump.

Tlaib has been among Biden's most vocal left-wing critics in Congress in the wake of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants launched a surprise invasion in southern Israel, killing over 1,000 people and taking dozens more hostage.

Israel has responded with heavy bombardment and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters, has said nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in the resulting conflict.

Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, has spent the last day urging Michiganders on social media to also protest Biden in the Democratic primary.

She wrote in one post on her Instagram Story, ""We attend marches and protests all the time! We can stand at a polling station for EVERY CHILD KILLED in Gaza. Don't stay home. Help the uncommitted campaign.""

Gun Owners Of America came out swinging against Senator John Cornyn, R-TX, after he entered the race to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Aidan Johnston, Gun Owners Of America’s (GOA) Federal Affairs Director, said tCornyn has failed to stand firm on conservative values and has instead, compromised with Democrats on gun control bills.

""Every time gun control gains steam in Congress, Senator John Cornyn is right there working with Democrats on a 'compromise.' That isn't conservative leadership, it's capitulation!,"" Johnston said.

CROWDED FIELD OF POTENTIAL MCCONNELL SUCCESSORS EMERGES IN SENATE

The GOA said that Sen. Cornyn's record on gun rights makes him ""wholly unfit"" to become the Senate minority leader.

""In the eyes of gun owners and all those who treasure our liberties, the traitor from Texas' record makes him wholly unfit to lead Republicans in the Senate,"" Johnston said.

The conservative gun rights group said Cornyn has helped pass a series of bills that are ""gross infringements"" on the Second Amendment.

The GOA pointed to Cornyn over the Safer Communities Act, which he cosponsored with Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy in 2022.

The bill incentivizes states to pass extreme risk protection laws, also called ""red flag"" laws, that allow members of the public and law enforcement to petition the courts for a civil order to temporarily suspend a person's access to firearms for fear that person might do violence.

MITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER

After gun rights advocates raised Second Amendment concerns, Congress included requirements that states applying for federal grants to implement red flag laws include certain due process protections.

""Sen. Cornyn is responsible for helping pass the so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that, among other things, bribes states to enact 'red-flag' gun confiscation laws, creates a national de facto wait period for young adults to buy a gun, and creates a backdoor ATF rule to eliminate the private sale of firearms,"" Johnston said. ""These are gross infringements on the Second Amendment.""

""The best thing Senator Cornyn could do for gun rights is join Mitch McConnell in retirement,"" he said.

Another conservative group, the National Association for Gun Rights, also came out against Cornyn's bid to replace McConnell.

""Cornyn is the most anti-gun Republican in Congress,"" said Dudley Brown, President of the National Association for Gun Rights. ""His sponsorship of ‘Fix NICS’ and proud role in passing the largest gun control bill in decades (Biden’s so-called Bipartisan Safer Communities Act) is repulsive to law-abiding gun owners.""



""When the most anti-gun President in history calls an anti-gun Republican ‘rational’ that should set off alarm bells in every law-abiding gun owners’ head,"" Brown added.

The gun groups' statements on Sen. Cornyn came after McConnell, 82, announced Wednesday that he plans to step away from leadership after becoming the longest-serving party leader in Senate history.

""I am asking my Republican colleagues to give me the opportunity to succeed Leader McConnell,"" said Cornyn, 72, in a statement released Thursday.

In the developing pool of potential successors, Cornyn is frequently mentioned as one of the ""three Johns"" likely to next lead the conference. The other two are Sens. John Thune, R-S.D. and John Barrasso, R-Wyo.

Sen. Cornyn's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Former President Trump will win the Michigan Republican Primary Tuesday night, winning yet another early contest and additional delegates — bringing him one step closer to being able to formally secure the GOP nomination.

The Associated Press projected Trump will win the primary shortly after polls closed Tuesday night.

With the Michigan win, Trump has claimed victory in every primary and caucus of the 2024 GOP presidential primary cycle.

Trump, who will likely secure the GOP nomination by next week after the Super Tuesday primary contests, dominated the Iowa caucuses, left New Hampshire with a commanding victory, swept caucuses in Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, won South Carolina with a ""bigger win"" than he anticipated.

MICHIGAN PRIMARY PUTS MAJOR BATTLEGROUND STATE IN PLAY FOR 2024

Trump needs 1,215 delegates to formally secure the nomination.

Both Republican and Democratic voters in Michigan hit the polls Tuesday to cast their ballots in the state-run primaries.

Republican voters on Tuesday had their choice from Trump, the clear frontrunner, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — the only two GOP candidates in the race — and others who have since dropped out, including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

JAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER 'UNCOMMITTED' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: 'HUGE PROBLEM'

There are 16 delegates at stake.

Trump called into the Michigan GOP Watch Party Tuesday night shortly after the race was called in his favor.

""I just want to thank everybody. This was a great day,"" Trump said, pointing to the state's autoworkers, saying Democrats ""destroyed the autowork business,"" but vowed to ""bring it all back into Michigan"" if elected.

""I just want to thank everybody…the numbers are far greater than we even anticipated,"" he said, adding that he will ""be doing a lot of campaigning over the next couple of months.""

""I can tell you this November cannot come fast enough,"" Trump said. ""We have the worst president in history--the most incompetent and the most corrupt president, and we can't let this continue.""

""So that day, November 5th, and January 20th is when we take over,"" Trump said, referring to Election Day and Inauguration Day. ""We're going to make America great again, greater than ever before.""

Democratic voters also had their chance to vote in the primary, casting ballots for President Biden or his Democratic challengers, Rep. Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson. Those voters also had the option to cast an ""uncommitted"" vote.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

It is almost too early to truly understand and divine where the votes might for someone to succeed retiring Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

The reason? The universe and conditions under which Republican senators will vote next fall to pick their new leader haven’t formed yet. Yes, take a look at the three Johns: Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), former Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). Even someone like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) could be in play. A source tells FOX is interested in the race.

GOP WON’T TAP MCCONNELL'S SUCCESSOR UNTIL NOVEMBER

But beyond that, we don’t know much.

Here’s why:

We have to first know who wins the presidential election. And if 2024 is anything like 2020, we might not definitively know until week or more after the election. A delay in figuring out the winner could delay the internal secret leadership election which Senate Republicans will take in mid to late November. But the winner of the presidential election will dictate who the GOP wants – especially if former President Trump prevails and has much to say about it.

Ironically, FOX is told that the antipathy between the former President and McConnell was not a major factor in the decision-making of the Kentucky Republican to step down.

MITCH MCCONNELL SENDS 'SHOCKWAVES' THROUGH SENATE WITH SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT

Another factor: who has control of the Senate – and by how many seats. Keep in mind we didn’t know until January 2021 as to which party would control the Senate in the last Congress.

This is why other figures may emerge. Especially dark horses.

As I have written before, leadership elections in Congress are not ""partisan politics"" They are ""particle politics."" The person who is propelled into leadership is not always the obvious choice: Think former House Speakers John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Or even current House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

WHY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS' IMPEACHMENT TRIAL MAY BE ON 'HIATUS'

FOX is told that some Senate Republicans are tired of what one senior Senate GOP leadership source termed a ""weekly MAGA show"" by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), JD Vance (R-Ohio) and others at the weekly Senate Republican Conference meetings. So if former President Trump loses and if the GOP doesn’t have control of the Senate, that could dictate who Republicans pick.

However, if Republicans prevail with a substantial majority, look at Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) as a possibility. He leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP’s campaign arm. Daines has made many of the right moves so far in GOP contests. If Republicans win the Senate by a good margin, some members (especially the new ones), might be willing to give Daines a look – if he’s interested.

The same factor could undercut Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). It’s not clear if Scott is interested. He ran unsuccessfully against McConnell in the fall of 2022. Scott led the GOP’s campaign efforts in 2022 – and Republicans failed to win the Senate. That could be an albatross for Scott and potentially inhibit him from making another run at leadership.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

A top House Republican lawmaker is changing his mind about retirement after urging from former President Donald Trump.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., said on Thursday that he is reversing course on his decision to not run for a fourth term.

""While my strong desire was to leave Congress at the end of this year, since my announcement, I have received countless calls from constituents, colleagues, and President Trump urging me to reconsider,"" Green said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""I will be running for re-election so I can be here on Day 1 next year to help President Trump end this border crisis once and for all.""

TRUMP WINS THE MICHIGAN GOP PRIMARY, BRINGING HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO SECURING REPUBLICAN NOMINATION

His announcement came shortly after Trump urged Green to reconsider in a post on his Truth Social account. The former president said he would endorse Green if he ran.

""Mark Green has had lots of options because of his political talents, and the great job he has done as a Congressman, but given the fantastic work he’s doing as Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I hope he runs for Re-Election to the U.S. House of Representatives. If he does, he has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"" Trump wrote.

In addition to running for his own re-election, Trump is throwing his influence into House and Senate races across the country with various endorsements and behind-the-scenes maneuvering.

TRUMP HOLDS LARGE DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD OVER HALEY AHEAD OF CRUCIAL SHOWDOWN

He met recently with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ campaign arm.

Their sit-down at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, earlier this month primarily involved discussions about the 2024 election cycle and how to keep and expand Johnson’s razor-thin two-seat House majority.

As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Green has played a leading role in the House’s impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

He told Fox News Digital last week that his role has been ""challenging, rewarding and meaningful.""

EXCLUSIVE: A New York City police officer who was attacked by migrants in Times Square is coming to Washington, D.C., to watch President Biden tout his administration’s work over the last year in his State of the Union address.

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only Republican representing New York City in the House, told Fox News Digital she invited NYPD Lieutenant Ben Kurian to the president’s major address on Wednesday.

""Our NYPD officers are on the front line every single day working to keep our streets safe, and unfortunately, now they are being forced to deal with hundreds of violent crimes being committed by those in our country illegally,"" Malliotakis said.

ICE OFFICIAL RIPS NYC POLICIES SHIELDING POLICE-BEATING MIGRANTS FROM DEPORTATION

""The horrifying video of Lt. Kurian and his fellow officer being attacked by a mob in Times Square was hard to watch, but it shed a light on just how difficult our officers’ jobs have become.""

She said his presence at Biden’s speech will ""bring attention to the need for the Biden administration to end its dangerous border policies.""

A now-viral video from late January showed two officers being attacked by a group of migrants in the heart of New York City’s tourist area.

NYPD CHIEF BLASTS MIGRANTS' ATTACK ON OFFICERS AS MUGSHOTS OF SUSPECTS RELEASED

One suspect can be seen kicking an officer in the head twice while another person kicked the other officer in the back.

The attack began after the police officers asked migrants who were blocking the sidewalk outside a shelter to disperse, the NYPD has said.

The incident was a flashpoint in the tension that’s long been simmering in New York City since it was flooded by thousands of migrants, many seeking asylum. A number were bussed up by Southern governors whose states were buckling under the strain of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

More than 161,000 migrants have come to New York City in need of shelter and other city resources since the middle of 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said.

AMERICANS AREN’T SAFE WITH BIDEN'S OPEN BORDER AND THE SYSTEM IS ‘FLASHING RED’

Earlier this week, Adams, a Democrat, called for curtailing the city’s ""sanctuary"" status to allow migrants ""suspected of serious crimes"" to be turned over to federal law enforcement.

Republican lawmakers, including Malliotakis, have denounced the city’s sanctuary policies as a primary driver of the migrant crisis.

When reached for comment on Malliotakis' speech invitation, the White House referred Fox News Digital to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre's earlier condemnation of the attack.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.

Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.

Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.

Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.

The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization.

The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was ""no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.""

Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.

Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.

Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.

""I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,"" Austin said at the time. ""I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden said Monday a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is close and hoped to see one materialize by ""the end of the weekend.""

The seemingly casual comments, carrying massive geopolitical significance, came during the president’s stop at an ice cream parlor near Peacock Network’s headquarters, where he had just wrapped up an interview with Seth Meyers on the ""Late Night"" show.

Asked by a reporter when he expected the ceasefire to begin, Biden, with a mint ice cream cone in hand, said he hoped by at least ""the end of the weekend.""

""At least, my national security advisor tells me that we’re close. We’re close. It’s not done yet,"" Biden said. ""And my hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a ceasefire.""

Biden also spoke about his planned trip to the southern border this Thursday where he will meet with border agents and discuss the need for bipartisan legislation.

Biden joked that ""my good friend"" would be making a border stop as well, a subtle nod to GOP rival, former President Trump, who is traveling to the border as well.

Biden's visit comes after the murder of Augusta University student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus in Athens last week allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant. Her murder has reinvigorated calls for Biden to take more stringent border measures.

The stop in Van Leeuwen came after a taped interview with Meyers, where dozens of pro-Palestinian activists were arrested for demonstrating in the lobby.

Negotiations are underway for a weekslong cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to allow for the release of hostages being held in Gaza by the Iranian-backed terrorist group in return for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The proposed six-week pause in fighting would also include allowing hundreds of trucks to deliver desperately needed aid into Gaza every day.

FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans have introduced legislation that would allow states to secure the border by constructing temporary border barriers along the southern and northern borders to stop the entry of illegal immigrants.

Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., is introducing the CONTAINER Act in the House – a bill that aims to give states the authority to build temporary barriers on federal land in an effort to stop illegal immigrants and drugs like fentanyl from entering into their states via the U.S.-Mexico border.

The bill is in response to legal battles that hit both Arizona and Texas over their efforts to secure the border with new barriers after border wall construction largely stopped when President Donald Trump left office.

BIDEN, DURING VISIT TO OVERWHELMED BORDER, URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK SENATE BILL: ‘TIME TO ACT'

In 2022, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, set up hundreds of double-stacked shipping containers across the border in an effort to stop illegal immigrants as numbers rose in his state. In 2023, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott installed wrecking-ball-sized buoys and razor wire along the Rio Grande as part of his Operation Lone Star.

Arizona’s barrier has since been removed. In December, a judge ordered Texas to remove its buoys in the Rio Grande, and a court battle between Texas and the Biden administration is ongoing after Texas sued the federal government for cutting the wire.

""Not only has the Biden Administration failed to enforce our laws and secure our border, but they have also barred border states from executing more robust border security measures,"" Rouzer said in a statement. ""No community is immune to the drugs, sex trafficking and crime these policies are incentivizing while enriching the cartels. This bill will give border states the explicit ability to erect physical barriers to protect not only their citizens, but all of America, from President Biden’s catastrophic open-border policies.""

Co-sponsors on the bill include House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R–Texas, and Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas.

""States like my home in Texas have the right to secure their borders when the White House refuses to do so,"" Pfluger said.

Companion legislation was previously introduced in the Senate by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who said last month that ""it’s clear Congress must act to give border states the explicit authority to protect their communities and the sovereignty of the United States.""

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Republicans have repeatedly called for border barrier construction as one of the ways to help secure the southern border. The House Republican border legislation, which passed the chamber last year, would restart border wall construction. However, it has not yet been taken up in the upper chamber.

The Biden administration has largely ended border wall construction, calling it ineffective. Some construction has continued where money has already been appropriated by Congress in previous fiscal years. It has also called for Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate border bill that does include some funding for border wall construction. But conservatives have warned that the legislation would normalize already-high levels of illegal immigration.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter Monday ahead of the government funding deadline later this week urging Republicans to reauthorize the federal radiation compensation policy.

The policy, known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), is on track to expire this spring. It was originally enacted in 1990 to compensate Americans exposed to radiation during the Manhattan Project and Cold War testing. While RECA has compensated many, there are still people awaiting claims, and certain affected groups have been overlooked, Hawley said.

""It is our duty to reauthorize and update RECA this spring. I emphasize that this is not a welfare program. It is a matter of basic justice for those the government poisoned,"" Hawley wrote in the letter. ""We’ve developed the most advanced nuclear weapons on earth, but we cannot forget the working people of this country who were sacrificed for it.""

BIDEN CALLS JOHNSON, SCHUMER FOR WHITE HOUSE MEETING AMID CONGRESSIONAL CHAOS STIRRING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FEARS

Hawley, a skeptic of additional funding to Ukraine, added, ""If we can send hundreds of billions of dollars in security assistance to foreign nations, we can spend a fraction of that on our own constituents who deserve help.""

Studies show that radiation from decades of mining, processing and enriching continues to permeate sites used during World War II and the Cold War.

In the 1940s, the U.S. was ramping up its military production to prepare for WWII, which included the government converting farmlands in Weldon Springs, Mo. into the Weldon Spring Chemical Plant. The plant produced a massive amount of TNT and DNT explosives for the war effort.

For Hawley, the issue hits close to home. In his home state of Missouri, nuclear waste was reportedly mishandled at one processing site, with leaky barrels left in the open air and contaminating a nearby creek where children have played for years. Hawley says in the letter many of those children have since developed cancer.

CONGRESS LIKELY TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES AGAIN, SOURCES SAY

""Tens of thousands of other Americans were exposed to radiation 'downwind' from over 100 atmospheric tests in western States,"" Hawley wrote. ""In most cases, nobody was warned of this danger. In others, the government simply lied. Repeatedly.""

But this could slow up the legislative process to approve government funding at the end of the week, as the upper chamber scrambles to pass full-year appropriations bills that would fund several federal agencies. The current temporary spending patch, known as a Continuing Resolution (CR), expires Friday and Congress will have to pass legislation by then to avert a partial government shutdown. The Senate has not introduced spending agreements yet for the remaining nine bills.

Hawley’s office told Fox News Digital it will seek to attach the RECA reauthorization to any legislative proposal that is likely to get signed into law.

This isn't the first time Hawley has tried to increase RECA's reauthorization chances by attaching it to any legislative vehicle that has a chance of passing. Last year, the Senate initially amended the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to include Hawley's RECA amendment, but it was later removed right before the package passed. Hawley's office has speculated it was removed due to cost.

Last year, some Republicans opposed a similar bill by Hawley that included RECA, arguing it would cost $100 billion over the course of a decade. Hawley proceeded to revise that portion of the bill and slashed the multi-billion dollar price tag, but his colleagues were still not convinced.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has opposed the proposal to reauthorize RECA, citing a commitment to shrink the federal deficit.

The Border Patrol union issued a fiery warning on Thursday to President Biden, telling him to ""keep our name out of your mouth,"" hours before the president is due to meet with officials at the border and urge passage of a Senate border bill.

Biden and former President Donald Trump are both heading to the border, with Biden visiting Brownsville, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders.

""During his trip, the President will receive a briefing on border security operations and an operational briefing from CBP, ICE, and USCIS. Afterwards, the President will deliver remarks to emphasize the need for Congressional Republicans to stop putting politics ahead of our border security and pass the bipartisan border security agreement,"" a White House official said.

BORDER PATROL UNION SLAMS BIDEN BORDER VISIT AS ‘TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE’ JUST TO ‘TRY TO SAVE HIMSELF’

That bipartisan bill, which includes additional staffing for Border Patrol and other agencies, as well as funding for cities and states receiving migrants and limits on asylum, won the backing of the union. Conservative lawmakers, however, rejected the bill and said it would normalize unacceptably high levels of illegal immigration and the bill has not progressed.

While it backed the bipartisan bill that Biden also supports, the National Border Patrol Council has otherwise been intensely critical of the Biden administration’s handling of the border crisis and put that in no uncertain terms in a post on X.

""Attention President Biden: Keep our name out of your mouth today,"" it said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on the post.

The union had issued a statement this week, calling the visit ""too little, too late.""

DUELING BIDEN, TRUMP VISITS TO BESIEGED BORDER COME AMID FRESH SLEW OF VIOLENT CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""But even if he were to put the proper policies in place at this late hour, he’d be doing it only to try to save his Presidency. And self-serving actions when time is winding down should always give Americans pause. Common sense dictates that as a lame duck, he’d revert to his open border policies if re-elected,"" the union said.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

""Biden is going to the border now solely to try to save himself. Border security should never be about politics, it should always be about the safety and security of this great nation and the American people,"" it said.

The trip comes as illegal immigration has become a top election issue, with polls showing a majority of voters see it as a critical threat to the country.

President Biden will seek to put the ball in the Republicans’ camp, repeating the administration’s argument that it is working within a ""broken"" system that needs funding and reforms from Congress. The White House has also pointed to a record of over 550,000 removals since May last year, more than any year since FY 23.

What's Happening?

- Fani Willis' disqualification hearing happening Friday afternoon…

- DC voters make their presidential primary pick…

- Harris' shrinking role in migrant crisis

Where was the VP?

President Biden visited the southern border in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday, and was joined by a number of top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but Vice President Kamala Harris was not among them.

Biden spoke in Brownsville after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He urged Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that he believes will help solve the raging crisis at the southern border.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

But the vice president, who was tasked in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration, was not there.

A year ago, Harris announced an additional $950 million in response to the Call to Action, bringing in a total of more than $4.2 billion since May 2021. But since then, her public role only appears to have continually shrunk, even amid a historic year for illegal immigration, with more than 2.4 million migrant encounters in FY 23. FY 24 has been similarly overwhelming, with over 300,000 encounters in December.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

Biden spoke in Brownsville, Texas, after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He began by addressing recent wildfires in Texas and Oklahoma, and linking them to climate change.

BORDER PATROL UNION TELLS BIDEN TO ‘KEEP OUR NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH’ AHEAD OF TEXAS VISIT

The visit, which coincided with former President Donald Trump's visit to the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, comes as illegal immigration has become a major 2024 election issue and remains a thorny issue for the administration. Polls show that more than half of Americans think large numbers of illegal immigrants entering the U.S. represents a critical threat to the country.

The crisis, now into its third year, has smashed multiple records with more than 2.4 million encounters in FY 23 and over 300,000 in December alone — breaking the record for monthly encounters.

President Biden and his administration have sought to shift the blame for the crisis onto the shoulders of Republicans. The administration says that it is working with a broken system that needs significantly more funding and comprehensive immigration reform. It introduced a bill on Biden's first day in office that included a mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants already in the U.S., which was immediately rejected by Republicans.

Republicans in the House introduced and passed legislation of their own that would fund more Border Patrol agents, resume wall construction, restart the Remain-in-Mexico policy and severely limit the ability of migrants to claim asylum.

After the White House made a supplemental funding request, including $20 billion for border funding in late 2023, Senate negotiators hashed out a deal that included additional staffing at the border and in asylum offices, an increased $1.4 billion in funding to cities and NGOs receiving migrants, took action to tackle fentanyl smuggling and would limit asylum claims. It would also increase detention beds to 50,000 and provide additional immigration judges.

DUELING BIDEN, TRUMP VISITS TO BESIEGED BORDER COME AMID FRESH SLEW OF VIOLENT CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

""Folks, the bipartisan border security bill is a win for the American people and a win for the people of Texas, and it's fair for those who legitimately have a right to come here,"" Biden said.

""The U.S. Senate need to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits, not on whether it's going to benefit one party or another party,"" he said, also calling for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to put it on the floor in the House.

However, it has failed to gain enough support in the Senate, as conservative lawmakers have warned that a limiting mechanism that only comes into place after an average of 5,000 encounters a day would normalize already-high levels of illegal immigration.

Biden said, however, that it was ""the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.""

He also appealed to his predecessor to back the bill.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

""I understand my predecessor is in Eagle Pass today — here’s what I would say to Mr. Trump,"" Biden said. ""Join me, or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together.""

Republicans in the House, who have recently impeached DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, say Biden doesn’t need additional congressional action to secure the border and can do so with the tools his administration already has.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Speaking to Fox News Digital ahead of the speech, GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., dismissed Biden’s trip as a photo op, and called it ""another sign of Biden’s incompetence.""

""It's just going to be another cleaned up photo op. It's not going to be any actual confrontation of the crisis that this guy created. Time and time again, Joe Biden proves that he cares more about minimizing the political implications of this issue than actually addressing it. So I don't expect much is going to come out of it, except the American people are going to realize once again that Joe Biden doesn't really mean business when it comes to the border,"" he said.

Emmer said that to solve the crisis, Biden needs to tackle the five issues that were in the House GOP bill: end catch and release, reform parole authority, finish the wall, reform asylum and restore Remain-in-Mexico, which kept migrants in Mexico for the duration of their hearings.

Emmer, like others in the House GOP caucus, was dismissive of the contents of the Senate bill that Biden is promoting.

""You're going to make it law now that he can let in up to 5,000 a day before it becomes a shutdown situation? Outrageous. And the fact that anybody even reports it as an option, I think is less than responsible,"" he said. ""You’ve got to do something in the five areas that the House has already addressed, but the bare minimum is to restore Remain in Mexico.""

In the Senate, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., called the speech a ""half-hearted attempt to pay lip service to the crisis his policies have caused.""

""President Biden can fix this crisis, and I hope his visit is the wakeup call he needs to use the authority he already has to build the border wall, reinstate Title 42, and end catch-and-release, so that we can finally secure our border, uphold our national security, and keep Americans safe,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

California Gov. Gavin Newsom called on President Biden to debate former President Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner, arguing that the president could ""beat"" Trump like he did in 2020.

""Biden beat Trump in the prior debates. I look forward to it,"" the California Democrat said during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.

The comment comes as Biden has so far refused to commit to debate Trump, who has a commanding lead in the Republican presidential primary race. Trump, on the other hand, has called on the president to debate him ""immediately,"" arguing such an event would be ""for the good of the country.""

'THE VIEW' HOSTS CLASH OVER WHETHER BIDEN SHOULD DEBATE TRUMP, WORRY PRESIDENT 'CAN LOSE'

Trump's desire to debate Biden comes despite his refusal to appear for debates against GOP primary foes, something Newsom argued Sunday was ""weakness masquerading as strength.""

""This is... pure projection on a guy who refused to debate in his own primary,"" Newsom said.

But not everyone believes Biden has much to gain by debating Trump ahead of this year's election, with the topic recently becoming the subject of a heated debate between the co-hosts of ""The View"" earlier this week.

BIDEN IS LYING LOW AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL AS COMMENTATORS WORRY THAT HE IS SEEN AS ‘NOT IN CONTROL’ OF THE NATION

Co-host Sara Haines had particularly strong feelings on the topic, warning that only Trump would benefit from the two candidates squaring off.

""Biden can lose, he can lose in a debate,"" Haines said. ""Trump will not. The people supporting Trump will support him whether he’s there or not. Biden makes one mistake, and the people who are undecided are out.""

Newsom's comments also come as speculation about his desire to jump into the race have continued to swirl, something the California governor said Sunday was off the table.

""I am here celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration,"" Newsom said, calling the continued speculation about his potential run ""idle chat"" and a ""sideshow.""

""It's not even an interesting conversation,"" Newsom continued. ""I think it's a damning conversation, frankly, the other side wants us to have… they love ginning this stuff up.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The budget office attributed the improved outlook to higher tax collections, noting significant gains in corporate tax revenues.

Minnesota's budget outlook has improved, officials said Thursday, with a slightly bigger surplus forecast for the current budget that will give the Legislature a little more breathing room this session.

Minnesota Management and Budget said the current two-year budget period, which runs through June 2025, is now expected to end with a surplus of just over $3.7 billion.

""The near-term economic outlook has improved, with growth expected to persist through 2027,"" the budget office said, citing higher tax collections. Corporate tax revenues are showing the largest gains due to higher-than-expected corporate profits.

The budget office is also forecasting a smaller potential deficit for the next two-year budget, which begins in July 2025.

Among those who are being floated as a potential replacement for the leadership position are senators John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; Rick Scott R-Fla.; Tom Cotton, R-Ark.; and Steve Daines, R-Mont.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced in a floor speech Wednesday he will step down from leadership in November. The Kentucky Republican is the Senate's longest-serving party leader in history.

Speculation about Thune, Barrasso or Daines taking over as leader stems from their current roles in GOP leadership. They serve as Republican whip, Senate Republican Conference chairman and National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, respectively.

MITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER

""Chairman Daines is laser-focused on taking back the Senate majority,"" NRSC communications director Mike Berg told Fox News Digital.

One source familiar with Senate Republican conference discussions shared that the ""three Johns"" — Thune, Cornyn and Barrasso — are not of the same political stripe. Barrasso is considered the most conservative out of the three, the source said. Barrasso is also believed to be a more palatable option for the various factions of Republicans in the Senate who don't always see eye to eye. He notably endorsed former President Trump early last month.

SEN. COTTON PROBES DOD HOW US AIRMAN WHO LIT HIMSELF ON FIRE WAS 'ALLOWED TO SERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY'

""What I'm focused on is the election,"" Barrasso told reporters shortly after McConnell's announcement.

As for decisions regarding leadership, he said, ""I'm going to talk to members of the conference, hear what they have to say, listen to them in terms of what direction that they want to take with us.""

Both Cornyn and Thune also endorsed Trump after Barrasso. Thune had initially endorsed fellow Sen. Tim Scott R-S.C., who ultimately dropped out and endorsed Trump.

Sen. Rick Scott was more pointed in his statement following McConnell's surprise announcement, saying in a statement, ""I have been very clear and have long believed that we need new leadership in the Senate that represents our voters and the issues we were sent here to fight for.""

When Scott challenged McConnell for the position, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told reporters McConnell received 37 votes from conference members, while Scott received 10. One Republican voted ""present."" Some of those who reportedly voted against McConnell were senators Josh Hawley, R-Mo; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Braun; Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who supported Scott in 2022, would welcome Scott's leadership if he were to take over, a staffer in Lee's office told Fox News Digital.

MCCONNELL SAYS SENATE TRIAL FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT IS THE 'BEST WAY FORWARD'

The source also shared that Cotton was being mentioned as a potential contender for the position. Cotton's office couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Cornyn, who does not hold a leadership position in the GOP and is poised to launch a potential bid for leader, said in a statement Wednesday that ""today is about Mitch McConnell.""

""But I've made no secret about my intentions,"" he added.

Cornyn on his timeline: ""Not today.""

Cornyn also endorsed former President Trump to be the Republican presidential nominee, and some lawmakers have begun looking to the likely GOP candidate for guidance about who should replace McConnell.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told reporters Wednesday the next person ""absolutely"" needs to have a more positive relationship with Trump, adding, ""He's going to be the next president, we have to work together.""

Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., agreed.

""It's so important that the next leader have a very positive relationship with the president,"" Marshall told Fox News Digital in an interview Wednesday. ""I think that this next leader needs to have a little bit more, maybe a lot more of a populist view.""

Marshall, who positioned himself alongside conservative hardliners who were critical of McConnell and voted against the bipartisan border deal in the national security supplemental package this month, added that the names being floated for leadership have been ""interviewing for the job since I got here.""

""I watch how they vote. I watch what their priorities are. I've been watching their volume on what issues they're championing,"" he said. ""All the names … have great qualities.

AFP Action, the conservative wing of the powerful and influential conservative Americans for Prosperity, funded by the billionaire Koch Brothers, has pulled funding for the presidential campaign of Nikki Haley.

In an email to staffers obtained by Fox News, AFP Action senior adviser Emily Seidel said the group did not believe that ""any outside group can make a material difference to widen [Haley’s] path to victory.""

""And so while we will continue to endorse her, we will focus our resources where we can make the difference. And that’s the U.S. Senate and House,"" Seidel wrote.

The news was first reported by Politico earlier Sunday.

AFP Action endorsed Haley in November, giving her a major grassroots and organizational boost.

The deep-pocketed fiscally conservative network launched an ad blitz on behalf of Haley in January, including mailers, digital ads, and connected TV spots.

AFP Action, which pledged to spend tens of millions of dollars to help push the Republican Party past former President Trump as it endorsed Haley in late November, said last month it was putting an initial $27 million behind this new wave in their ongoing campaign.

TOP HIGHLIGHTS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA'S GOP PRIMARY WHERE TRUMP WON BIG, HALEY VOWED TO PRESS ON

The news came after Haley’s GOP rival, former President Trump, won the GOP primary in Haley’s home state of South Carolina on Saturday.

Despite the loss, and defying calls to exit the race, Haley has said it’s not the ""end of our story"" as she traveled Sunday to Michigan ahead of the state’s primary on Tuesday.

In the less than 24 hours following her Saturday night loss, Haley's campaign said that she had raised $1 million ""from grassroots supporters alone,"" Fox News previously reported.

EUROPEAN NATIONS HAVE TO START PAYING UP: DONALD TRUMP

Haley's campaign argued that the money raised ""demonstrates Haley's staying power and her appeal to broad swaths of the American public.""

Asked Sunday about losing funding from AFP Action, Haley said she was ""not worried.""

""Americans for Prosperity was an amazing partner. They strongly believe in freedom. They believe in limited government. They believe in all the things that I, as a conservative, believe. And they've been fantastic through these states,"" Haley said, vowing to continue fighting ""for the 70% of Americans that don't want to see a Trump-Biden rematch.""

With his win Saturday in the first-in-the South contest, Trump has now swept every primary or caucus on the GOP early-season calendar that awards delegates. His performances have left little maneuvering room for Haley, his former U.N. ambassador.

The Border Patrol union mocked President Biden on Saturday for his trip to the Texas border this week.

""Board AF1, take nap. Wake up in place called Brownsville,"" the union wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in a joke itinerary of his day, along with a photo of Biden resting in a beach lounge chair. ""Read large teleprompter message, ‘It's all Trump's fault.’ Board AF1, ask who people in green uniforms were, told they ‘strap’ illegal aliens, express horror, take nap. Wake up, call a lid, hit beach, take nap.""

While in Brownsville on Thursday, Biden lamented that the bipartisan immigration bill failed to pass in the Senate, blaming Trump for using it as a political issue. Many Republicans have expressed their opposition to the bill, which they say doesn't do enough.

""The majority of Democrats and Republicans in both houses support this legislation,"" Biden said in Brownsville, ""until someone came along and said don't do that that'll benefit the incumbent. That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.""

WATCH: BORDER PATROL UNION CHIEF EXPLODES ON BIDEN IN FIERY PRESS CONFERENCE, SAYS AGENTS ‘P----D’ AT POLICIES

The president faces increasing scrutiny over his handling of the border as the Border Patrol continues to report a record number of migrant encounters.

In December alone, there were more than 300,000 encounters – an all-time record.

The issue also threatens to hurt Biden politically ahead of November’s presidential election.

Trump was also at the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday which he said is ""being overrun by the Biden migrant crime,"" invoking the murder of Georgia student Laken Riley allegedly by a Venezuelan migrant last week.

BIDEN, TRUMP MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION

""The parents are devastated and they’re incredible people,"" Trump said. ""This is a Joe Biden invasion. A Biden invasion. I call him crooked Joe… the most incompetent president we've ever had.""

Biden and his administration have sought to shift the blame for the crisis onto the shoulders of Republicans. The administration says that it is working with a broken system that needs significantly more funding and comprehensive immigration reform. It introduced a bill on Biden's first day in office that included a mass amnesty for millions of migrants already in the U.S., which was immediately rejected by Republicans.

Republicans in the House introduced and passed legislation of their own that would fund more Border Patrol agents, resume wall construction, restart the Remain-in-Mexico policy and severely limit the ability of migrants to claim asylum.

The Border Patrol union frequently mocks the president over illegal immigration.

The organization wrote in part on X on Friday, ""Wasn't it Biden who encouraged people from all over the world to ‘surge the border’? Didn't Biden immediately void all the successful Trump EO's that were keeping our border under control? Didn't he publicly and viciously accuse BP agents of criminal assault, then told the world ‘those people will pay’, and the entire thing was made up BS? Has he apologized or taken responsibility for any of it, or asked forgiveness from the victims of some of the millions of illegal aliens he imported into this country?""

And before Biden went to the border, the group posted, ""Attention President Biden: Keep our name out of your mouth today.""

The murder of a Georgia nursing student allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested in New York City is the ""direct result"" of recent New York City laws that severed ties between the NYPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Republican Councilman Joe Borelli argued.

""It is a direct result of the City Council passing legislation that limits cooperation. If those laws were not enacted, the Department of Corrections would have given ICE the opportunity to issue a detainer against Jose Ibarra,"" Borelli told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week.

Georgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 22, was discovered beaten to death earlier this month after going for a run on the University of Georgia’s campus. The Augusta University student crossed paths with illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra, according to authorities, and died from blunt force trauma to the head.

Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was granted border ""parole,"" which allows noncitizens to temporarily enter the country due to an emergency or humanitarian reason, authorities have said. Ibarra soon made his way up to New York City, where he was arrested in August and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,"" according to ICE.

7.2M ILLEGALS ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

The NYPD, however, has said it does not have a record of Ibarra's arrest.

Typically, when ICE learns an illegal immigrant is arrested on criminal charges, the agency will issue a detainer that requests the local police department hold the suspect until ICE can take over and begin deportation proceedings.

In Ibarra’s case, ICE said he was released by the NYPD before a detainer could be issued.

New York City, however, is a ""sanctuary city"" with relatively recent laws passed by City Council severing many ties between the NYPD and ICE.

""A woman is dead in Georgia because the New York City Council passed local laws barring the NYPD from cooperating with ICE, and as such the suspect was released without any notification to federal law enforcement,"" Borelli tweeted this week, accompanied by a list of laws that restricted local cooperation with the immigration agency.

Under a pair of 2014 laws, the local Department of Corrections and NYPD were restricted from complying with ICE detainers under certain conditions. The DOC, for example, is only allowed to comply with an ICE detainer if it is accompanied by a warrant from a federal judge and if the suspect has been convicted of a violent crime in the last five years.

""Our city is not served when New Yorkers with strong ties in the community are afraid to engage with law enforcement because they fear deportation. Today, we send another message to Washington that the time to act has come to provide relief to so many individuals who contribute to our nation’s growth,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said when the two laws were enacted.

""I’d like to thank Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the City Council for passing this legislation, which further establishes New York City as a leader in immigration reform.""

Similar reforms continued under the de Blasio administration, including in 2017, when the City Council passed a bill prohibiting ""City agencies from partnering with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration law.""

""The de Blasio Administration today announced the issuance of citywide guidance and new NYPD protocols to clarify and institutionalize the City’s policy that it will not voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities, and will only coordinate in limited circumstances, including where there is a public safety risk,"" a press release from the de Blasio administration stated of the law at the start of 2018.

Borelli, who has served on City Council representing portions of Staten Island since 2015, argued ""it's interesting to see people trying to backtrack on the impact that these laws have on the cooperation between ICE and city law enforcement.""

GEORGIA STUDENT MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

""But the proof is in the pudding,"" he said.

The New York Republican pointed to comments made by local politicians when the laws were passed, arguing that Democrats wanted to sever communication between local law enforcement and federal authorities when involving illegal immigrants.

""The day we start helping ICE is the day we lose the public trust, which is why this guidance and protocol is so critical,"" a former NYC council member said in 2018, when de Blasio announced the prohibition of city agencies partnering with the Department of Homeland Security when related to immigration laws.

Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams also supported the measure in 2018, when he served as Brooklyn borough president.

""It is important for our police officers and City employees to have clear guidance and protocol on how to interact with federal immigration enforcement, especially considering the overaggressive behavior of ICE agents. Public safety for all of our residents must come first,"" Adams said, according to the de Blasio-era press release.

Following Laken Riley’s murder, Adams said this week that he supports altering city laws that would open the doors to New York City officials working with federal authorities on immigration matters involving violent suspects or repeat offenders.

""I want to go back to the standards of the previous mayors who I believe subscribed to my belief that people who are suspected of committing serious crimes in this city should be held accountable,"" Adams told reporters at City Hall Tuesday.

""We should not be allowing people who are repeatedly committing crimes to remain here, and we cannot collaborate with ICE in the process,"" the mayor added.

Adams has repeatedly spoken out in support of keeping New York City as a sanctuary city, saying illegal immigrants in the Big Apple should not live in fear of receiving city services, such as attending a school, due to their immigration status.

When asked about Borelli's comments and the laws passed by City Council under his administration, de Blasio told Fox News Digital in a statement that it's time for ""tougher border policies.""

""I trust the NYPD, and they say they never encountered the accused individual. But it’s sickening that a young, promising life was cut short. Any way you slice it, we need tougher border policies and comprehensive immigration reform,"" de Blasio said.

The former mayor also pointed Fox Digital to an opinion piece he wrote this month, in which he proposed accepting ""Republican demands for greater border security in exchange for full funding of a humane and functioning asylum process,"" along with ""spending billions to create the facilities necessary on the Mexican side of the border, including the concessions and incentives the Mexican government would require in order to accept this plan.""

Borelli argued the push by the City Council to sever ties with federal authorities back when de Blasio was in office evolved from Democrats in the city wanting to resist what they saw as a ""Trump agenda"" on immigration.

""This was a reaction by the de Blasio administration and the City Council to push back on what they saw as the Trump agenda. And as long as they were doing what they could to oppose Trump, they didn't care,"" he said.

Borelli said the local legislation is now backfiring as New Yorkers and others question the laws’ logic.

""It's completely backfired when people start to question, ‘What is the logic of having people who are here illegally in the first place, and then commit crimes against New Yorkers and others?’ There's limited rationale for keeping them here, even if you were a progressive who is sympathetic to people coming here in the first place,"" Borelli said.

Laken Riley’s murder has shocked many Americans and heightened outrage about the Biden administration’s border policies. More than 7 million illegal immigrants have flooded the nation since President Biden took office in 2021, a figure larger than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News Digital analysis previously found.

Riley was reportedly so badly beaten during the murder that her skull was disfigured, investigators reported in an affidavit.

""He’s a sick puppy,"" Borelli told Fox Digital when asked about the brutal attack. ""[He] would not have withstood screening, we hope, if we had a proper system of vetting and deporting people.""

Ibarra is in custody and was charged with the felonies of malice murder, murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and concealing the death of another, as well as the misdemeanor of physically hindering a 911 call, according to the affidavit filed Feb. 23.

LAKEN RILEY MURDER: MEDIA OUTLETS FOCUS ON LONE JOGGERS, DOWNPLAY SUSPECTED KILLER’S IMMIGRATION STATUS

New York State Senate Republicans on Wednesday announced the renaming of legislation that would allow local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE. The legislation will now be known as ""Laken's Law"" in memory of Riley.

""Because of New York law, because of New York sanctuary state laws, local law enforcement do not notify federal immigration officials when they take someone into custody, even if they're here — especially when they're here illegally,"" Republican New York state Sen. Robert Ortt said at a press conference Wednesday.

""So, Laken Riley's murderer, albeit an alleged murderer, was in custody, law enforcement custody, and he was released without notification to ICE, to federal authorities, because of policies and laws passed by Democrats here in New York State,""

Montgomery County officials met with ICE’s Baltimore Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to discuss cooperation on Tuesday. In a statement, county officials said there was a ""productive discussion"" between County Executive Marc Elrich and Baltimore Field Office Director Darius Reeves ""about improved communications and operational challenges with custody transfers."" An ICE official told Fox News Digital that a dialogue had been opened on honoring detainers and they were looking forward to a mutually beneficial arrangement.

ICE lodges detainers against illegal immigrants who are brought into local police custody when ICE believes them to be deportable. Those detainers request that the police notify ICE when they are about to be released and sometimes hold them for a limited additional time so that ICE can take them safely into federal custody and act to remove them.

However, ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions refuse to honor such detainers. Montgomery County claims it is not a sanctuary county, and that it works with ICE in their work on ""immigration and customs violations and drug and human trafficking."" Elrich said on a press call on Wednesday that the county does honor some detainers when an illegal immigrant is convicted of violent crimes.

Despite that claim, ICE says no detainers have been honored in the county in either the last fiscal year or this one. Director Reeves told Fox News Digital this week that in FY 2023, ICE issued 198 detainers, none of which were honored. So far in FY 2024, the agency has issued 119 detainers and none have been honored by the county.

He said those included illegal immigrants with convictions for assault, robbery, illegal firearm possession, sex abuse of a minor, rape and other sex offenses. He also said there was at least one MS-13 gang member among those whom ICE had requested, but they had been rebuffed by the county.

In the state of Maryland as a whole, the agency arrested 152 sex offenders in FY23. He said the counties that do not honor detainers – which he said includes Montgomery County – account for 46% of at-large sex offender arrests.

On Tuesday, ICE told Fox 5 that a Salvadoran national charged this week with the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland had been arrested twice in Montgomery County and released both times despite ICE lodging a detainer. Elrich said his initial arrests were for theft and were not on the list of violent crimes that would have resulted in him being turned over to ICE.

Reeves says ICE will go into the community and locate many of those illegal aliens, and brought them into custody, but stressed that releasing them onto the streets poses a threat to both ICE agents and the public.

""Any at-large operation like that, it's just an inherent risk and risk to the officer and risk to the subject of our arrest and it's a risk to normal day-to-day citizens that happen upon the scene,"" he said.

""The most violent of folks potentially have weapons on them. You can have incidents where… they take off in their vehicles and crash into other folks. It's just a whole host of issues that would not occur if the detainers were being honored. We could come to the jails and we can take them out of the jails in a safe environment and move them toward their immigration hearings.""

He also stressed that it is not a major burden on state and local jurisdictions.

VENEZUELAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST 14-YEAR-OLD IN VIRGINIA

""We're not asking any of these jurisdictions that are unwilling to cooperate to hold anyone for us beyond the 48 hours after their state release. What we are asking is to have advance notice of 48 hours so we can have the resources made available to pick up these individuals and in a very safe manner,"" he said.

In 2021, the Biden administration implemented significantly narrowed ICE enforcement priorities, limiting ICE to recent border crossers, national security threats and public safety threats. So Reeves stressed that the illegal immigrants they are typically targeting are normally serious criminals.

""We are focused on egregious offenders, major public safety threats and, national security threats. We are not focused on the single mother, migrant mother who happens to steal diapers or formula from the local bodega to feed her children. We are interested in guns. We're interested in sex trafficking, human trafficking, violence, rape, murderers, gangs. Those are the people that we're concentrating on.""

In its statement, the county said the meeting is one of a number of such meetings, and the two sides will be meeting again in the coming weeks.

""The County cleared up some misconceptions about our policy on immigration enforcement (ie Montgomery County is not a sanctuary county) and ICE underscored their need for more notice prior to releases,"" the statement said.

""Director Reeves offered resources and training for our Department of Corrections staff and the County shared our policy on notification to allow ICE to provide feedback,"" the statement said.

The meeting comes as ""sanctuary"" policies have come into focus after a number of high-profile crimes have been committed by illegal aliens after they have been previously arrested and then turned back onto the streets despite an ICE detainer lodged against them. In New York City, one of the most high-profile sanctuary cities, Mayor Eric Adams said this week that sanctuary laws need to be modified to turn migrants who have committed felonies over to ICE.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

The first son is expected to take questions from lawmakers and congressional investigators behind closed doors before the House Oversight and Judiciary committees.

The deposition was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.

Hunter Biden's expected testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden ""has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest"" in his business ventures.

BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES

House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Tony Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.

House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.

""The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,"" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in statement Tuesday. ""Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.

""In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.""

He added that the committee will continue to investigate to ""determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.""

Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.

After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to ""now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.""

Also last week, congressional investigators heard testimony from a former business associate of Hunter's — Jason Galanis, who is serving a 14-year prison sentence. Galanis testified during a rare transcribed interview from an Alabama prison that Joe Biden was allegedly considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.

Joe Biden's involvement would bring ""political access in the United States and around the world,"" he claimed.

JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES

Hunter Biden was first subpoenaed to appear for a closed-door deposition in November. The deposition was slated for Dec. 13, but the first son defied the subpoena. Instead of appearing to testify, he held a press conference on Capitol Hill during which he defended himself and his father, saying the president ""was not financially involved in my business.""

Ahead of his subpoenaed deposition, Hunter Biden had offered to testify in a public setting.

Comer and Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, rejected his request, noting that the first son would not have special treatment and pointing to the dozens of other witnesses who have appeared as compelled for their interviews and depositions. Comer and Jordan vowed to release the transcript of Hunter Biden’s deposition.

But after he defied the subpoena, the committees in January passed resolutions to hold the first son in contempt of Congress for defying the congressional subpoena. Before those resolutions were able to be considered by the House Rules Committee and the full House, Hunter Biden’s attorneys offered to discuss scheduling a new deposition for the first son — something House Republicans were willing to do.

HUNTER BIDEN DEPOSITION SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH AFTER RISK OF BEING HELD IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS

The president’s son’s deposition comes after years of congressional investigations into his business dealings, beginning in September 2019 in the Senate. That investigation was led by senators Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis.

Hunter Biden’s business dealings and foreign relationships came under heightened scrutiny in the fall of 2019 during the first impeachment of former President Trump.

Trump was impeached after a July 2019 phone call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine, specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings and Joe Biden’s successful effort to have former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin ousted.

FLASHBACK: GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SHARE HUNTER BIDEN'S CHINA-LINKED BANK RECORDS WITH US ATTORNEY LEADING CRIMINAL PROBE

Hunter Biden was quietly under federal investigation, beginning in 2018, at the time of the call, a probe prompted by suspicious foreign transactions.

Trump's request was regarded by Democrats as a quid pro quo because millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen. Democrats also said Trump was meddling in the 2020 presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a Democratic political opponent.

Republicans had been investigating Hunter Biden’s business dealings, specifically with regard to Burisma Holdings. House Republicans, who were in the minority at the time, made several requests to subpoena Hunter Biden for testimony and documents related to the impeachment of Trump and his business dealings that fell at the center of the proceedings.

FLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE

Biden has acknowledged that when he was vice president he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, and Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board, receiving thousands of dollars per month. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion of critical U.S. aid at the time if Shokin was not fired.

""I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion.' … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,’"" Biden recalled telling then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Biden recalled the conversation during an event for the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

""Well, son of a b----, he got fired,"" Biden said during the event. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

Biden allies maintain he pushed for Shokin's firing when he was vice president due to concerns the Ukrainian prosecutor went easy on corruption, and they say that his firing, at the time, was the policy position of the U.S. and international community.

FLASHBACK: HUNTER BIDEN 'TAX AFFAIRS' UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION; LINKS TO CHINA FUNDS EMERGE, SOURCES SAY

Now, as part of the impeachment inquiry, Republicans are investigating any involvement Joe Biden had in his son’s business dealings.

Last year, the federal investigation into Hunter Biden that began in 2018 also came under heightened scrutiny when two IRS whistleblowers claimed politics were influencing prosecutorial decisions throughout the years-long probe.

Those allegations sparked congressional investigations and, ultimately, the impeachment inquiry. They also put pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to give then-U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware David Weiss special counsel authority.

WEISS SAYS HE 'WASN'T GRANTED' SPECIAL ATTORNEY AUTHORITY IN HUNTER BIDEN PROBE DESPITE REQUEST: TRANSCRIPT

Special counsel Weiss indicted the first son on federal gun charges in Delaware last year. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges. His attorneys are attempting to have that case dismissed.

Also last year, Weiss charged Biden with nine federal tax charges, which break down to three felonies and six misdemeanors for $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid.

Weiss charged Hunter Biden in December, alleging a ""four-year scheme"" in which the president's son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.

A group of Democrats who started a movement in opposition to President Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza sent a clear message in the Michigan primary, exceeding the amount of votes the group was aiming for and complicating the key battleground state ahead of this year's general election.

""Yesterday was a resounding victory,"" Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who joined the ""Listen to Michigan"" movement, said during a news conference Wednesday claiming victory for the movement.

The comments come following the movement's push to have Democratic voters select ""uncommitted"" in Tuesday's Democratic primary surpassed the group's expectations, with just over 101,000 people selecting the option, according to Associated Press numbers as of Wednesday afternoon. That mark was more than 10 times the group's stated goal, which was to get 10,000 people, or roughly the same as the margin of victory in the 2016 election in the state, to select the option.

POLL SHOWS BIDEN'S LEAD OVER TRUMP SHRINKING IN 2024 MATCHUP AS CONCERNS OVER PHYSICAL FITNESS GROW

Despite the apparent resounding success, Biden easily captured the state and gained 115 delegates while hauling in over 81% of the vote, further solidifying his grasp on the nomination and setting up a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in November.

""I want to thank every Michigander who made their voice heard today. Exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy is what makes America great,"" Biden said in a statement after the Michigan victory while warning that there is ""much left to do"" to defeat Trump in November. ""You’ve heard me say many times it’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of America. It’s never a good bet to bet against Michiganders either. This fight for our freedoms, for working families, and for Democracy is going to take all of us coming together. I know that we will.""

Meanwhile, Listen to Michigan supporters have warned they are willing to continue growing the movement ahead of the general election, a potential headache for the Biden campaign in a battleground state that has seen close margins in the last two presidential elections.

JAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER 'UNCOMMITTED' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: 'HUGE PROBLEM'

Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a Biden campaign spokesperson noted that the share of uncommitted votes, 11%, was actually in line with the previous time an incumbent was on the ballot in the state in a Democratic primary, which was during the 2012 re-election campaign of Former President Barack Obama. Nevertheless, the spokesperson stressed that the campaign is still working hard to earn the votes of holdouts and will continue working towards peace in Gaza.

But the movement started by Listen to Michigan may not be in Biden's rearview mirror after Michigan, with the group saying activists in future primary states have reached out about joining the cause.

""Two of the states where organizers have reached out specifically are Minnesota and Washington State,"" a Listen to Michigan spokesperson said during Wednesday's news conference. ""We have our eye on those states… and are ready to have conversations with anybody organizing for an anti-war future.""

The organization has also brushed off suggestions that it may at least indirectly help Trump regain the presidency, arguing that it is up to Biden to earn their votes.

""We are not electing Donald Trump. President Biden is the one seeking the highest office, and he is the candidate who's facing off against Donald Trump,"" Hammoud said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said Thursday the brother of the suspect charged with the murder of Georgia student Laken Riley was arrested multiple times in Athens, Georgia, in 2023, but its requests to take him into custody were ignored.

Diego Ibarra, a Venezuelan national, was arrested last week and charged with green card fraud.

His younger brother, Jose, is charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another in the homicide of Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student.

The two brothers from Venezuela were living in the United States illegally. ICE confirmed Jose's illegal status earlier this week.

In a statement Thursday, ICE said Diego Ibarra had first entered the U.S. April 3, 2023, near Eagle Pass, Texas, but was removed via the COVID-era Title 42 process. He reentered April 30 and was enrolled into ""Alternatives to Detention,"" by which migrants are monitored via GPS tracking when released.

BROTHER OF UGA MURDER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH GREEN CARD FRAUD

He was released May 12, 2023, but by May 25 was judged to have bolted from the program after abnormalities with his GPS tracking device. Enrollees can be tracked in a number of ways, including a bracelet or a cell phone app. Last year, the administration pushed for a reduction in ICE detention beds and more funding for ATD but is now pushing for more detention beds.

The ICE statement said he has several arrests in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, but that ICE detainers — requests that ICE be notified when an illegal immigrant is being released for a transfer to ICE custody — were not honored.

The Athens-Clarke County Police Department told Fox News Digital it is not responsible for ICE notifications and does not have access to immigration status. It said that is instead handled by the Clarke County jail and directed Fox to the Clarke County Sheriff’s office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why the detainers were not honored.

The revelation comes a day after Athens Mayor Kelly Girtz repeatedly rejected the characterization Athens is a ""sanctuary"" city.

""There's been no legislation from this government that’s created sanctuary city status,"" he said.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Fox reported this week that Diego Ibarra was fired from the University of Georgia after it was discovered he presented a fake green card to work at the school's dining hall.

""Diego Ibarra presented a fake green card to the hiring unit to begin a temporary position as a dishwasher in Bolton Dining Hall at the University of Georgia on Feb. 6, 2024,"" UGA spokesperson Greg Trevor told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Diego then failed to ""submit further documentation required to keep the job and was never paid by the university"" before he was ""fired,"" Trevor added.

The White House on Wednesday issued a statement to Fox News Digital calling on local governments to work with ICE on deporting violent criminals.

""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities.

""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.

""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the southwest border. (The) 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013.""

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is urging the Department of Defense (DOD) to share information about the agency's contract with a Chinese-owned financial corporation that provides tutoring services for U.S. military families.

On Thursday, Cotton sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calling the business relationship with Hong Kong-based Primavera Capital Group ""ill advised, reckless,"" and a danger to U.S. national security.

Primavera, the capital group associated with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, owns the tutoring service Tutor.com and has provided critical funding to the TikTok giant.

""We should not be giving the Chinese communists access to the data of United States servicemembers and their families,"" Cotton, a member of the Senate's intelligence committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""I look forward to a full explanation from the Department of Defense on their continued use of Tutor.com.""

Like ByteDance and any other Chinese tech company, Primavera is subject to Chinese national security laws which require tech companies to release confidential business and customer data. Primavera acquired Tutor.com in January 2022.

""While providing educational services, Tutor.com collects personal data on users, such as location, internet protocol addresses, and contents of the tutoring sessions,"" Cotton wrote. ""As Chinese national security laws require companies to release confidential business and customer data to the Chinese government, we are paying to expose our military and their children’s private information to the Chinese Communist Party.""

Cotton also sought clarification on whether an internal review has been conducted to determine the continuation of the business relationship with Tutor.com, and if such a review has not taken place, an explanation is requested. Additionally, Cotton wants statistics on the annual usage of Tutor.com by military personnel or their dependents, and whether users are informed that their data may be shared with a Chinese company.

Cotton has previously called for a nationwide ban on TikTok, saying last month that the CEO is ""lying"" about the app being safe for users.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seeking to amend the city's sanctuary laws to exclude illegal migrants who have committed violent crimes.

Adams has mentioned his desire to tighten the city's regulations on illegal migrants multiple times this week, with his latest at a Tuesday press conference.

""I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,"" Adams said on Tuesday.

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS DOUBLES DOWN ON CALL FOR CHANGES TO CITY'S 'SANCTUARY' STATUS AMID MIGRANTS CRISIS

He added, ""You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.""

This echoes the New York City mayor's previous remarks made during a Q&A session at an event on Monday.

""The overwhelming amount of migrants that are here, they want to work. I still don’t understand why the federal government’s not allowing them to work,"" Adams said Monday. ""They need to have the right to work like all of us that have come to this country had the ability to do so.""

MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS NEW YORK CITY HAS 'RUN OUT OF ROOM' FOR MIGRANTS: 'IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER'

""But those small numbers that are committing crimes, we need to modify the sanctuary city law that if you commit a felony, a violent act, we should be able to turn you over to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and have you deported.""

He added, ""It is a right to live in this city, and you should not be committing crimes in our city. Right now, we don’t have the authority to do so.""

Adams commended his administration on Monday for doing an excellent job during a challenging time, but he stated his hands are tied by federal and local law.

The mayor spoke about some migrants participating in robberies and using mopeds to commit snatch-and-grab stick-ups.

Adams has said before that migrants committing crimes should be handed over to ICE and deported.

Under the proposal from Republican Sen. John Polk of Hattiesburg, the board that governs the eight schools would choose three to close by June 30, 2028. The bill does not specify which institutions would close but says the board would make the decision based on enrollment, federal aid, tuition rates, degree programs and local economic impact.



MISSISSIPPI MAN GETS OVER 3 YEARS FOR RACIST, HOMICIDAL THREATS MADE ON SNAPCHAT

House Universities and Colleges Committee Chairman Donnie Scoggin, a Republican from Ellisville, said he had not studied Polk's bill, but a study committee to evaluate those metrics would be a necessary prerequisite.

""I am not for closing any of the colleges at this time without having a whole lot more knowledge,"" Scoggin told The Associated Press. ""I would not support that without knowing a whole lot more.""

Citing declining enrollment at several institutions, Polk has said the Legislature is appropriating too much money to keep the universities afloat. He declined to comment further on Wednesday.

Polk's proposal is not the first attempt to reduce the number of universities in Mississippi.

In 2009, then-Gov. Haley Barbour said Mississippi could not afford to keep all eight. Barbour, a Republican, proposed reducing the number to five by merging Mississippi University for Women into Mississippi State University and consolidating the three historically Black universities — Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi Valley State — into one school with Jackson State in charge. His proposal never gained traction because of widespread opposition from legislators and alumni groups.

Democratic Sen. Hillman Frazier of Jackson said Barbour’s failure showed there has never been a strong appetite for closing institutions in Mississippi. He also said the universities could reverse their enrollment declines with more state support.

""If you give the institutions the tools they need to attract students, that will address that,"" Frazier said. ""It sounds good politically, trying to be a fiscal conservative, but we need to give our universities the tools they need to be successful.""

Mississippi University for Women has attempted to recruit more students by switching to a name that doesn’t include the word ""Women."" But the university said last week that it was pausing that rebranding effort.

The eldest son of Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., was arrested Tuesday after several property thefts were reported in Rifle, Colorado, police said.

Tyler Jay Boebert, 18, faces five felony charges and more than a dozen misdemeanor offenses in connection to a recent string of vehicle trespass and property thefts, the Rifle Police Department said.

He is charged with four counts of criminal possession of ID documents belonging to multiple victims, one count of conspiracy to commit a felony and ""over 15 additional misdemeanor and petty offenses,"" the department stated.

""This is an ongoing investigation, no further information will be released at this time,"" Rifle police said, adding that all suspects are considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

REP. LAUREN BOEBERT'S EX-HUSBAND ARRESTED FOLLOWING ALTERCATION WITH CONGRESSWOMAN AT RESTAURANT

Online jail records show the teen is currently in the custody of the Garfield County Sheriff's Office. There is no bond information listed.

Reached for comment, Rep. Boebert said, ""I love my son Tyler, who has been through some very difficult, public challenges for a young man and the subject of attention that he didn't ask for.""

""It breaks my heart to see my child struggling and, in this situation, especially when he has been provided multiple opportunities to get his life on track,"" she said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""I will never give up on him and I will continue to be there for him. As an adult and father, Tyler will take responsibility for his actions and should be held accountable for poor decisions just like any other citizen.""

Boebert, 37, announced last year that her son Tyler, then-17, fathered a baby boy with his girlfriend, making her a grandmother.

Police were involved with Boebert's family earlier this year when officers received reports that the congresswoman was fighting with her ex-husband and Tyler's father, Jayson Boebert.

Jayson was arrested on Jan. 9 following the incident on charges of misdemeanor assault and criminal mischief. He was later released on bail from Garfield County Jail, according to the New York Post.

BOEBERT RESPONDS TO REPORTS OF FIGHT WITH EX-HUSBAND AT COLORADO RESTAURANT AFTER POLICE CALLED

A judge granted Boebert a temporary restraining order against her ex-husband earlier this month after she alleged Jayson threatened to harm her and himself.

In court papers, the lawmaker claimed her former spouse ""made multiple suicidal threats and threats to harm me over the past 14 months,"" according to the Denver Post.

Jayson told The Associated Press in an interview that he was the victim at the restaurant. ""I would never harm Lauren. I just want to move on and be in peace,"" he said.

He also accused his ex-wife of using the restraining order to ""justify"" her move to a new congressional district.

In her request, Boebert also cited a physical fight between her ex-husband and their 18-year-old son on Jan. 9. As Tyler called authorities, Jayson allegedly grabbed a rifle and left, according to court documents. Jayson was charged with harassment, prohibited use of a weapon and third-degree assault, court documents show. Boebert was not present during that altercation.

A Republican who has served two terms in the U.S. House representing the western side of the state, Boebert announced on Dec. 27 that she was switching congressional districts this year to run for a seat representing the eastern side of Colorado. The 4th Congressional District seat is open with the retirement of Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.

Six people were arrested Tuesday after police say they disrupted a city council meeting.

Officers were called to Seattle City Council chamber around 2:55 p.m. ""as people filled the room and continued to interfere with the session,"" police said in a news release.

The three men and three women were told to leave the chamber, but police say they refused and were told they would be arrested if they continued to interrupt. All six were charged with criminal trespass, and one of the men was also charged with obstruction.

Video of the meeting was posted on the city's Seattle Channel website, lasting just under two and a half hours. Two recesses were taken during that time, including one taken at the time police were called. It was supposed to last 15 minutes but went on for more than an hour.

Police say the city council meeting was able to resume after the arrests and many others left the chamber without any issues, but chanting and banging on windows could be heard when council members attempted to continue.

""Our physical safety is being threatened by the actions of the demonstrators outside banging on the windows, which could easily get broken, and we will have a mob scene,"" District 5 council member Cathy Moore said while asking for police assistance. ""I physically feel threatened.""

The protesters were referred to as ""progressive activists"" by local radio reporter Jason Rantz on the social media platform X. He said they were demanding that the city fund housing for refugees, even though ""they are not even being housed in Seattle currently.""

Many of them used the public comment portion of the meeting to talk about the issue.

""The issues of refugee housing and police surveillance are related,"" a woman named Lauren said. ""More money for police surveillance and ineffective and racist technologies like [‘Spothotter’] means less money for asylum seekers and other low-income people who desperately need housing.""

Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.

A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.

The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.

INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS

On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as ""heartbreaking"" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.

""As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.""

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.

""Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,"" he wrote.

OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO

The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.

Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.

Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday downplayed the notion that President Biden’s trip to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday was political and blamed Republicans for making the crisis worse.

President Biden and his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, are both scheduled to make dueling trips to the border on Thursday. Biden will visit Brownsville, while Trump will visit Eagle Pass, an area that has seen high levels of illegal crossings and has become a flashpoint in an ongoing battle between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the Biden administration.

Responding to a reporter’s question that Biden’s visit was merely in reaction to Trump’s visit – during an election year, no less – Jean-Pierre said the president’s schedule couldn’t just be upended on such short notice.

""[The president] has said that when Republicans rejected that Senate bipartisan bill on border security, on the immigration policy to fix a broken system that has been broken for decades, he said he was going to take it directly to the American people and also at the same time, hear from law enforcement and frontline personnel who deal with this issue every day,"" Jean-Pierre said.

President Biden, despite reversing many Trump-era border policies upon taking office, has repeatedly said his hands are tied on the border issue, saying the matter must be solved via legislation.

A bipartisan Biden-backed border security deal crafted by Senate negotiators amid an unprecedented surge in immigration collapsed in early February after Trump signaled his disapproval. That, in turn, has given the White House fodder to accuse Republicans of not taking the border issue seriously.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES TO COOPERATE WITH ICE, AMID FUROR OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMES

Jean-Pierre said Republicans, having rejected the deal, are ""getting in the way"" when it comes to fixing the border.

""This is not about politics for this president. This is about how we're going to fix an issue that the majority of Americans care about, a broken immigration system, the challenges at the border. That's why the president thought it was important to go at this time,"" Jean-Pierre said.

Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich noted that the administration has often criticized Republicans who go to the border to hold similar press conferences, writing them off as ""publicity stunts"" and ""photo ops.""

Jean-Pierre said Biden’s visit was ""very different,"" and repeated her assertion that Republicans ""constantly get in the way.""

""They consistently get in the way of what the president is trying to do to get more resources,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""They are turning this into a political stunt by listening to Donald Trump and saying that they need to kill it.""

On the suggestion that Biden just happened to be going to the border during an election year, despite it being a problem for the past three years, Jean-Pierre pointed to Biden’s ""comprehensive immigration policy"" implemented on day one of his presidency.

""He did that on the first day. That was his first piece of legislation. I would hope the American people would see how serious this president was or is about fixing this issue,"" she said.

MARYLAND COUNTY TO OPEN ICE COOPERATION AFTER PAST STONEWALLING, RELEASE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

After taking office, Biden signed two executive orders on immigration and pledged to roll back many of the policies put in place by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Within a few months, Biden took more than 90 actions related to the border.

Under the president’s stewardship, illegal immigration has skyrocketed to historic levels. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report for fiscal 2023 showed that the number of illegal immigrants on the non-detained docket soared from 3.7 million in FY 2021 to nearly 4.8 million in FY 2022 to nearly 6.2 million in FY 2023.

Thursday will mark Biden’s second visit to the border since taking office. The area he is visiting, the Rio Grande Valley, which includes Brownsville, gives Biden a platform where illegal crossings have dropped sharply.

The area is also a friendly congressional district that – as noted by Border Patrol Union President Brandon Judd – historically hasn’t seen much illegal traffic, in large part due to the infrastructure Trump provided while in office, and more recently due to the actions of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott since Biden took office.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

End of an Era

Longtime Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.

McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in an emotional speech in the Senate shortly after noon.

""One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,"" he said. McConnell's first Senate term started in 1985, under the late President Reagan, and McConnell remained a huge fan (despite Reagan at first calling him ""Mitch O'Donnell -- Close enough""). But McConnell didn't reminisce much.

""There'll be plenty of time to express my gratitude and greater detail as I sprint towards the finish line, which is now in sight,"" he said.

McConnell's dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference after the November election, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

McConnell has also butted heads with former President Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, who said at a Fox News town hall recently: ""I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].""

Yet after McConnell's announcement, gratitude poured in from both McConnell's allies and his critics. ""I’m grateful for his service.... I think Mitch's tenure has had many legacies. But no legacy is more consequential than the nomination and confirmation of hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary. And that is a lasting benefit to the American people for which I'm deeply grateful,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters.

McConnell said he intends to finish his current Senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.

Oklahoma authorities are investigating a local high school after footage from a fundraiser event appeared to show students sucking and licking one another's toes last week.

The footage from Deer Creek High School in Edmond, Oklahoma, shocked and disgusted social media users across the country this weekend. Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters soon announced an investigation into the incident, calling it ""disgusting.""

The footage, originally obtained by Fox 25, was taken during a week-long fundraiser for a local coffee shop that employs people with special needs. Students from 9th through 12th grade volunteered to take part in various class competitions that students paid to attend, according to the outlet.

The video shows student volunteers who were paired up, one set sitting on chairs while the others laid down below them and licked peanut butter off of their toes.

""This is disgusting,"" Walters said in a statement on Friday. ""We are cleaning up this filth in Oklahoma schools. Our agency is investigating.""

Outrage librarian Libs of TikTok soon shared the footage on social media, demanding to know ""who approved this."" The account mistakenly claimed that the students were paired up with adults in the activity, however.

Reactions to the incident rolled in, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declaring ""this is child abuse.""

Walters then replied to Cruz' statement, saying ""Completely agree. We are stopping this in Oklahoma.""

Parents and students also reacted in statements to Fox 25. One parent who spoke with the outlet anonymously said

""It was surprising,"" one student told the outlet. ""I didn't think they were going to do all that. I was just shocked. I didn't really have like a feeling. I was kind of disgusted, and then kind of glad I wasn't over there.""

""Whenever she told me yesterday that was happening, I had to ask her, 'Wait, what? They're licking peanut butter off of toes? What?"" one parent said of a conversation with their student.

Meanwhile, the school celebrated the ""success"" of the fundraiser in a public statement.

""This afternoon, Deer Creek High School announced a grand total of $152,830.38 raised for Not Your Average Joe Coffee, an organization created to 'inspire our community by including students and adults with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities,"" school staff wrote.

""On Thursday, February 29, 2024, Deer Creek High School hosted an assembly called the Clash of Classes for students who paid to attend. During this assembly, ninth through twelfth grade students volunteered to participate in various student-organized class competitions, in the spirit of raising money for NYAJ. All participants in the assembly were students who signed up for the game(s) they played ahead of time. No Deer Creek faculty or staff participated in any of the games during this Clash of Classes assembly. Many dedicated students gave generously of their personal time to achieve this momentous accomplishment, which will serve communities beyond the boundaries of Deer Creek. We would like to thank all of the patrons, businesses and sponsors who contributed to the success of this year’s Wonderful Week of Fundraising,"" the statement continued.

The tax credit bill received bipartisan support, passing the chamber by a vote of 162-3. It provides a state income tax credit of up to $300 that could be used to pay for training and gun storage devices.

But Democrats decried the second bill banning the merchant code as a giveaway to the gun lobby that would make the state less safe.

STATE DEMS ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘BACKDOOR GUN TAX’ ON LAWFUL FIREARM OWNERS

Both bills now go to the state Senate for consideration.

Merchant category codes exist for almost every kind of purchase, including those made at supermarkets, clothing stores, coffee shops and many other retailers. In 2022, Visa and other credit card companies said they would adopt the International Organization for Standardization’s new merchant code for gun sales, though they later put that decision on hold in the face of opposition from the gun lobby and conservative politicians.

There had been hope that categorizing credit and debit card purchases would allow authorities to potentially see red flags — like significant ammunition purchases — before a mass shooting could happen.

Republican state Rep. Jason Ridley, noting the ISO is based in Switzerland, said the code could be used to create a registry of gun sales.

""I don’t care which side of firearms you stand on,"" he said. ""Nobody should know what you’re buying and keeping a registry, especially a foreign country.""

Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state.

""She probably should drop out,"" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. ""I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.""

But Jodi said ""she should still stay in the race.""

""She's a better candidate than Trump,"" she added.

Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday.

""I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,"" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. ""I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.""

""I really don't know what she's doing,"" he continued. ""She's out of control.""

Similarly, Scott said, ""she needs to get out"" of the race. ""It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,"" he added.

KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT

Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman.

""She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do."" George said. ""If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.""

But Dan said he had ""no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.""

""She’s got no path to victory,"" he continued.

Theresa said: ""She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.""

Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination.

""I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.""

Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because ""we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.""

""I like Trump,"" he said. ""Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.""

But Josh said Haley's effort ""seems pointless.""

""It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,"" he told Fox News, ""which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

President Biden's predictions of a cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel are looking too sweet to be true, with multiple Hamas officials rejecting the current deal.

Biden predicted between licks of an ice cream cone on Monday that Hamas would accept a deal with Israel in the coming days, but statements from Hamas officials show little hope of progress.

""I hope by… the end of the weekend,"" Biden said Monday with cone in hand. ""My national security advisor tells me we’re close. We’re close. It’s not one yet. My hope is by next Monday, we’ll have a cease-fire.""

Meanwhile, multiple Hamas officials indicated on Tuesday and Wednesday that no breakthrough in negotiations had been made, according to The New York Times.

ISRAELI SECURITY EXPERTS SAY BIDEN’S PALESTINIAN STATE PUSH IS AN ’EXISTENTIAL THREAT’

""We are not interested in engaging with what’s been floated, because it does not fulfill our demands,"" Hamas official Ahmad Abdelhadi said in an interview with a Lebanese broadcaster.

BIDEN TO GO TO UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO FORCE TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE ON ISRAEL, HALT RAFAH OFFENSIVE

More concerning, Hamas spokesman Basem Naim said the terrorist organization had not even received ""any new proposals"" since the parties met last week.

Hamas is not the only party warning Biden to pump the brakes. Qatar, which has played a major role throughout the negotiations, indicated on Tuesday that there is no deadline for an agreement.

""The efforts are ongoing; all the parties are conducting regular meetings,"" Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters, according to NYT. ""But for now, while we certainly hope it will be achieved as soon as possible, we don’t have anything in our hands so as to comment on that deadline.""

Meanwhile, Israel is deep in the planning process for an expected invasion of Rafah, the Gaza town on the border with Egypt that plays host to both the final remnants of Hamas and key routes for aid.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an invasion would proceed at some point regardless of whether a cease-fire agreement is reached.

President Biden visited the southern border in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday, and was joined by a number of top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but Vice President Kamala Harris was not among them.

Biden spoke in Brownsville after meeting with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. He urged Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that he believes will help solve the raging crisis at the southern border.

""It's real simple, it's time to act, it is long past time to act,"" the president said. ""It's time for us to move on this, we can't wait any longer.""

BIDEN, DURING VISIT TO OVERWHELMED BORDER, URGES REPUBLICANS TO BACK SENATE BILL: ‘TIME TO ACT’

But the vice president, who was tasked in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration, was not there.

The administration had initially leaned firmly into the root-causes narrative in early 2021, claiming that those causes – which include climate change, violence, poverty and economic insecurity – were driving migration to the U.S. border. Its answer, therefore, was to engage with governments and to invest in targeting those causes, eventually bringing migration down.

The assignment quickly led to Harris being dubbed the ""border czar"" – a title the White House rejected, stressing instead that it was more to do with international engagement. She would go on to visit the border in El Paso in June 2021 after facing pressure.

As part of that effort, Harris has been attempting to rally private-sector investment to the region via a Call to Action – particularly into the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

""First, I do believe most people don't want to leave home. They don't want to leave their grandmother. They don't want to leave the place where they worship and the community that they've always known,"" Harris said in 2022. ""And so, when they do, it is usually for one of two reasons: They are fleeing harm, or to stay means they simply cannot satisfy their basic needs or the needs of their family.""

A year ago, Harris announced an additional $950 million in response to the Call to Action, bringing in a total of more than $4.2 billion since May 2021.

But since then, her public role only appears to have continually shrunk, even amid a historic year for illegal immigration, with more than 2.4 million migrant encounters in FY 23. FY 24 has been similarly overwhelming, with over 300,000 encounters in December.

Harris was not part of the border tour on Thursday, nor was she part of a delegation to Mexico City in December with Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

In that meeting, the two countries, according to a White House readout, ""reaffirmed their existing commitments on fostering an orderly, humane, and regular migration.""

""This includes reinforcing our partnership to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, inequality, and violence, and for the two countries’ initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans,"" it said.

Yet, despite the discussions on root causes, Harris was not in attendance. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.

The L.A. Times recently reported that Harris will meet with new Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo in Washington to announce more private-sector investment.

7.2M ENTERED US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES

But root causes, while still on the agenda, have appeared to be less of a focus for the administration in its border strategy — in part because the migration surge has increasingly been coming from countries coming outside of the Northern Triangle, including from Venezuela, Nicaragua and China.

The administration is now focused on passing the Senate border bill, which has bipartisan support but has struggled to gain enough support to pass due to conservative opposition. The bill includes additional funding for staffing at the border, funding for cities and NGOs, as well as rules tightening asylum and a mechanism to shut down entries when they reach a certain level. Conservatives say it would codify an unnecessarily high level of illegal entries.

Harris has put out a statement calling for Congress to pass the bill earlier this month.

""Let us remember: we are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants have always helped strengthen our country, grow our economy, and drive innovation. We know that in America, diversity is our strength,"" she said. ""So rather than politicize this issue, let us all address it with the urgency and seriousness it requires.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Washington state Republican Chair Jim Walsh has called having voters write their party affiliation on the outside of their mail-in ballot a ""questionable design decision"" as some Washingtonians have raised concerns.

Walsh told Fox News Digital on Friday the requirement to declare one’s party is ""codified in law"" and is only for the primary, not the general election.

""The design where the attestation, the declaration is on the outer part of the envelope, that is not state law, that is a guideline, an administrative decision made by the Washington Secretary of State in conjunction with local county level election officials,"" he said.

Walsh added, ""That is not statutory, that’s just a questionable design decision by the Secretary of State working in conjunction with the local county elections people.""

Walsh said state Republicans have been trying since 2016 to change the law requiring voters to declare their party ""so that people can choose to be unaffiliated,"" but have been blocked by the Democrat-led legislature.

One X user snapped a photo of their ballot envelope, showing where voters must declare themselves as Democrats or Republicans, writing on Thursday, ""New Washington State envelopes for mail-in ballots. NEVER had to disclose my party declaration on the OUTSIDE of my ballot before. Don't feel really good about this.""

Cartoonist Scott Adams reposted it, writing, ""How can this be real?"" and X owner Elon Musk responded, ""What!?""

Another voter wrote, ""QUESTION- Why am I REQUIRED to list party affiliation on the outside of the envelope to VOTE?""

A third X user posted a picture of their envelope, writing, ""Washington State Presidential Primary Ballot … you have to declare on the outside of the envelope?!? Also no option for independents! This is how ballots get tossed before they can even be counted!""

""We’re not keen on the law, but we understand it is the law and that we do need to comply both with state law and with some national and with some national party rules,"" Walsh told Fox News Digital of the requirement to declare a party.

He said the ""spirit of the law"" is to keep voters from people from ""gaming the system, being part of one party and trying to vote in the other party’s primary"" but he felt there could be genuine security concerns with the declaration being on the outside of the ballot.

He told Seattle-area radio host Jason Rantz this week that he suggests voters take their ballot to a ballot box rather than mailing it in.

""Deliver it to a ballot box. Or give it to a trusted person to deliver,"" he said.

But Rantz noted in an opinion piece, that ""Fraud at the primary stage doesn’t make a whole lot of sense this election cycle. Donald Trump will be the nominee and it’s unlikely any other candidate would come close enough for stealth fraud to take place. And while fraud (and mistakes) obviously occur, there’s been no recent evidence of widespread fraud that would be enough to change national elections. But voters rightly remember the scandal around the recount between then-gubernatorial candidates Dino Rossi (R) and Christine Gregoire (D).""

The Washington Secretary of State’s Office has included examples of protests voters wrote on their ballots in 2016 — in showing voters the correct way to mark their ballot — that included statements such as, ""Actually I’m an Independent but if it makes you happy,"" ""Don’t tell me what I need to be … the voters are furious"" and ""I feel like I am being forced to choose a party and that’s not fair.""

The voter's party declaration choice is removed after 60 days, according to the secretary of state's office, noting on its website, for the ""Presidential Primary only, the major political parties require voters to mark and sign the party declaration. If you choose to participate, your choice of party will not affect how you may vote in future elections. You must mark and sign the political party declaration (box) on your envelope for your vote to count.""

The office has not clarified why the declaration is on the outside of the ballot. Fox News Digital has reached out to the secretary of state's office.

A New York state appeals court has denied an attempt by New York City leaders to implement a law that would let non-citizens vote in local elections.

In a 3-1 ruling issued Wednesday by the Appellate Division for the Second Judicial Department, the body said the law violated the New York Constitution and Municipal Home Rule Law.

It ""must be declared null and void,"" the court said in a 43-page ruling.

The law was passed in December 2021 by the City Council and created a class of ""municipal voters,"" comprising non-citizens who reside in the city for at least 30 days before an election and register or pre-register to vote. Municipal voters would be granted the right to participate in elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president and council member.

WISCONSIN'S GOP-LED LEGISLATURE MAKES SECOND ATTEMPT TO DRAW MAPS BEFORE SUPREME COURT DOES

The law faced legal challenges almost immediately.

It would have applied to some 800,000 new eligible voters in a city of 8.5 million. However, the appellate court said that the clause in the state constitution that says ""every citizen shall be entitled to vote…"" applies exclusively to U.S. citizens.

""As there is no reference to non-citizens, and thus, an irrefutable inference applies that non-citizens were intended to be excluded from those individuals entitled to vote in elections,"" the court said.

New York Mayor Eric Adams enacted the law upon taking office in January 2022. It was ruled illegal several months later. The mayor defended the law and appealed a lower ruling against it.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Adams' office and it was not clear if he would appeal Wednesday's ruling.

REPUBLICAN PARTY INFIGHTING ESCALATES IN OHIO AS MARCH PRIMARY NEARS

Many Democrats championed the law, saying it would make the city's politics more inclusive, while Republicans contended it could lead to voter fraud and that Democrats were only looking to pad their numbers.

""Great news! We won in the appellate court and @NYCMayor’s attempt to implement the law to register non-citizens to vote in #NYC elections has been struck down,"" U.S. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-New York, posted on X. ""This is a big victory in preserving both the integrity of our elections & the voice of American citizens!

Malliotakis, who represents New York's borough of Staten Island, was one of several plaintiffs to sue over the law, along with Borough President Vito Fossella.

""Fortunately, common sense prevails in New York, thanks to the decision reached by the Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department. The New York State Constitution is clear in that only citizens can vote in our local elections. It is simply irresponsible and nonsensical to extend this right to non-citizens. We are pleased that the Appellate court shared this understanding. This is a win for New York citizens and upholds the integrity of our elections,"" Fossella said.

The New York Immigration Coalition said it was disappointed in the ruling.

""For generations, New York City’s culture and economy have benefited from the immigrants who have come here to work, raise their families, uplift their communities and pay taxes in New York,"" NYIC Executive Director Murad Awawdeh said in a statement. ""While we are still reviewing the decision and its impact on immigrant New Yorkers, the lawsuit remains another shameful attempt by xenophobic Republicans who would disenfranchise residents rather than promote a more inclusive and participatory democracy. Immigrant New Yorkers deserve a say in how their local government functions and spends their tax money, and we remain committed to ensuring the expansion of voting rights.""

The ruling comes as New York City is grappling with a surge in migrants that has resulted in an uptick in crime and anger from residents. In December, Adams warned that the city was at its ""breaking point"" as city resources and shelter services had become strained.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

After coming into office in 2021, Biden regularly launched rhetorical bombs at Georgia and other states as being ""Jim Crow 2.0"" or ""Jim Eagle,"" for requiring voter ID for mail-in voting. However, Georgia allows three weeks of early voting.

Delaware Superior Court Judge Mark H. Conner ruled in a 25-page opinion, ""The enactments of the General Assembly challenged today are inconsistent with our Constitution and therefore cannot stand.""

Delaware’s constitution in Article 5 Section 1 states that a ""general election shall be held biennially on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November."" The Delaware early voting law, enacted in 2019, allows in-person voting up to 10 days before an election.

FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS DOJ PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE BLACK GEORGIA VOTERS WOULD BE HURT BY SHORTER EARLY VOTING

""The conflict between these two passages is obvious,"" the judge wrote. ""Our Constitution enumerates the one day an election shall be held biennially, and the Early Voting Statute allows for voting at least 10 days before that date.""

The Delaware Board of Elections argued that the words, ""election shall be held"" refers to the last day votes can be cast.

MICHIGAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION GIVES COMMUNITIES MORE TIME TO HANDLE ABSENTEE BALLOTS

The plaintiffs in the case were Delaware state Sen. Gerald Hocker, a Republican, and Delaware resident Michael Mennella, an inspector of elections for the Delaware Department of Elections. Mennella was represented by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a Northern Virginia-based election watchdog group.

""This shows that states have to follow their own constitutions,"" J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Fox News Digital.

He noted this comes days after a New York state appeals court ruled that New York City’s law to allow noncitizens to vote in municipal elections violated the state constitution.

When asked about Biden’s remarks toward other states such as Georgia, Adams said there was some irony.

""There is a little bit of irony, though he never served in the Delaware legislature that passed these laws,"" Adams said. ""But if he wants to talk about state voting, he might want to devote his energy to Delaware.""

Currently 46 states and the District of Columbia allow early in-person voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That tally includes Delaware, which could still appeal the decision.

Neither the Delaware Board of Elections nor the state attorney general’s office responded to inquiries from Fox News Digital for this story about whether there were plans to appeal. Adams said he was not aware of the state’s plans.

This marks Mennella and the legal foundation’s second victory over the state of Delaware in less than two years. In December 2022, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in Mennella’s favor when he challenged the constitutionality of the state’s universal vote-by-mail and same-day voter registration laws.

The lower court judge on Friday also determined a provision of the early voting law that allowed registered voters to get permanent absentee voting status was unconstitutional based on Article 5 Section 4A. This section was added to the state constitution in 1943 and specifies conditions when someone is ""unable to appear"" for in-person voting because a voter is away from home or is sick or disabled. This would also be determined on a per-election basis.

""By granting indefinite absentee voting to those who are unable to vote in a single election extends beyond the limited authority granted to the General Assembly by our Constitution,"" the judge ruled.","{'href': 'https://www.foxnews.com', 'title': 'Fox News'}"

Trump and his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were barred earlier this month from operating their business in New York for a range of two to three years. Trump was also found liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

TRUMP BARRED FROM OPERATING BUSINESS, ORDERED TO PAY OVER $350 MILLION IN NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE

The former president is appealing the ruling.

On Wednesday, though, a New York Appeals Court judge ruled that the former president must post a bond for the full amount of the judgment and the independent director of compliance will be appointed.

The judge will temporarily allow Trump and his sons to continue running the business as they appeal the decision.

The filing is a temporary order before the motion goes before the full Appeals Court. James’ brief to the panel is due March 11, and Trump's replies are due March 18.

The ruling comes after New York Judge Arthur Engoron handed down his decision earlier in February after a months-long trial beginning in October and stemming from James' lawsuit alleging the former president inflated his assets and committed fraud.

Engoron ruled that Trump and other defendants were liable for ""persistent and repeated fraud,"" ""falsifying business records,"" ""issuing false financial statements,"" ""conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,"" ""insurance fraud"" and ""conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.""

The judge also barred Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or legal entity in New York for two years.

TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR

Engoron also ""permanently"" barred defendants Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and former corporate controller Jeffrey McConney from ""serving in the financial control function of any New York corporation or similar business entity registered and/or licensed in New York State"" and as a director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in New York for three years.

James brought the lawsuit accusing Trump and the Trump Organization of fraudulent business practices. The court proceedings were contentious, with Engoron repeatedly placing Trump under a partial gag order to prevent him from criticizing court staff.

James had sought $370 million, plus 9% interest in penalties from Trump. Any awarded funds would go to the New York State Treasury, unless directed elsewhere by the state comptroller.

Trump dismissed the trial as a ""witch hunt"" throughout the process, accusing both Engoron and James of serving as political operatives for Democrats. Trump's legal team also repeatedly blasted the lack of a jury in the trial.

""There was never an option to choose a jury trial,"" a Trump spokesperson told Fox News Digital last month. ""It is unfortunate that a jury won’t be able to hear how absurd the merits of this case are and conclude no wrongdoing ever happened.""

Trump and his family denied any wrongdoing, with the former president saying his assets had been undervalued. Trump's legal team insisted that his financial statements had disclaimers, and made it clear to banks that they should conduct their own assessments.

JUDGE IMPOSES PARTIAL GAG ORDER IN TRUMP ORG TRIAL, BLOCKING PARTIES FROM VERBAL ATTACKS AGAINST COURT STAFF

Trump has said his financial statements were ""perfect,"" and stressed that the bank loans were repaid and ""as happy as can be.""

Throughout the trial, Trump attorneys brought witnesses, including former Deutsche Bank top executives, who testified the banks sought additional business from Trump, whom they viewed as a ""whale of a client.""

Trump's defense also brought in expert witnesses, including New York University accounting professor Eli Bartov, who reviewed the Trump financial statements at issue in the case and said he found no evidence of accounting fraud.

Bartov testified last month that Trump’s financial statements did not violate accounting principles, and he suggested that anything problematic — like a huge year-to-year leap in the estimated value of his Trump Tower penthouse — was simply an error.
