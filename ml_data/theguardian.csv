The Guardian,"While George Galloway’s portentous declaration of “a shifting of the tectonic plates” was the sort of hyperbole he specialises in, his sweeping victory in the Rochdale byelection does carry some lessons for other parties, and not reassuring ones.

It is not the first or even the second time Galloway has swept aside his former party Labour by claiming to be the only candidate who can properly represent the interests of Muslim voters, rolling into town with a mass of eager volunteers and a platform based less on policy than on his fiery rhetoric.

But his capture of nearly 40% of the vote in Rochdale – with the cut-adrift Labour candidate, Azhar Ali, pushed into fourth place in a seat the party formerly held with a near 10,000 majority – has come in the context of the Gaza war, and the many divisions connected to it.

As demonstrated in November, when eight Labour frontbenchers resigned to vote for a ceasefire motion, and last week, when the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, allowed the party to duck a similar vote over concerns about intimidation, the party remains badly split on the issue.

Of course, it is possible Labour would have held off Galloway had it not disowned Ali after it emerged he had suggested Israel had deliberately allowed the 7 October massacre by Hamas to take place.

But Galloway’s ability to galvanise voters aghast at the death toll in Gaza, particularly the roughly 30% of the town who are Muslim, via what was effectively a single-issue campaign with literature in the colours of the Palestinian flag, demonstrated the strength of feeling.

In the wake of the byelection, some observers have noted that while in Westminster support for an immediate ceasefire can almost feel a niche position, it is backed by a clear majority of the public.

Gavin Barwell, the former Tory MP who was Theresa May’s chief of staff, argued on Friday that recent protests should not be misrepresented. “The extremists are a very small minority but the truth is the British people overwhelmingly support a ceasefire,” he said.

Could the Workers Party of Britain, Galloway’s latest political vehicle, remove other Labour MPs at the general election? That seems less likely given its tiny resources, plus the fact that, unlike in Rochdale, it would face the might of Labour’s campaigning machine.

Galloway’s return to parliament comes only days after Rishi Sunak argued that “mob rule” had taken over British politics, a reference to regular pro-Palestine demonstrations and threats to MPs over the issue.

Expect some politicians, perhaps Suella Braverman, who has already claimed Islamists are “in charge”, to respond to Galloway’s win via the ruthless targeting of one demographic as another sign of shattered community cohesion.

The reality is perhaps less apocalyptic, if nonetheless messy. Galloway won in the same way in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005, and Bradford West in 2012. He served one term in each with minimal impact in parliament, the country more widely or, his critics said, for his constituents.

Galloway will hope to arrive back in Westminster as the figurehead for Gaza. But he is too divisive and controversial a figure to have broad appeal, and past experience shows he much prefers campaigning to become an MP than the slightly more prosaic business of actually being one.

What else can we divine from Rochdale? For Reform, this was a gloomy night after relatively strong showings in last month’s Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections.

Its candidate, the former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager, finished sixth behind an independent, the Liberal Democrats and a Conservative candidate who spent much of the campaign period on holiday.

Reform suggested this poor result was in part due to logistical exhaustion for the tiny party, and perhaps the most basic lesson of all from the byelection is that the nuts and bolts of campaigning and getting out the vote really do matter.

Overall, this was something of a depressing spectacle for a town facing significant deprivation and numerous other problems barely addressed by many of the 11 men who vied to become its representative.

The Galloway circus has once again swept in, declared a revolution and will most likely slink out again, this time in a matter of months. The 69-year-old has another political scalp to brag about. And what has Rochdale got? For now, it seems, not much.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Galloway, one of the most divisive politicians in Britain, won almost 40% of the vote in a contest beset by chaos and controversy and dominated by the conflict in Gaza.

He took aim at Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak in a victory speech that was interrupted by hecklers after a dramatic count at the Rochdale leisure centre.

“Keir Starmer, this is for Gaza,” he said. “You will pay a high price for the role that you have played in enabling, encouraging and covering for the catastrophe presently going on in occupied Gaza, in the Gaza Strip.”

Galloway won 12,335 votes – 39.7% of the total – in a much more sweeping victory than anyone had predicted, giving him a 5,697-vote majority.

A surprise second place went to David Tully, a local businessman who stood as an independent, saying he would speak up for the town rather than use it as a vehicle for political ambition.

Labour, which abandoned its candidate, Azhar Ali, over inflammatory comments he made about Israel, finished in fourth place with just 7.7%, having held a near-10,000 vote majority in the constituency.

Ahead of Ali in third was the Conservative candidate, Paul Ellison, who was barely visible on the campaign trail and is understood to have spent some of the period on holiday.

Galloway, an ex-Labour MP, has now unseated his former party in three elections and will return to parliament representing a fourth constituency in 37 years.

Addressing Starmer from the podium, Galloway said: “This is going to spark a movement, a landslide, a shifting of the tectonic plates, a score of parliamentary constituencies, beginning here in the north-west, in the West Midlands, in London, from Ilford to Bethnal Green and Bow.

“Labour is on notice that they have lost the confidence of millions of their voters who loyally and traditionally voted for them generation after generation.”

On Friday, the deputy leader of Galloway’s party accused the government and Labour of “effectively facilitating the genocide in Gaza. Former Labour MP Chris Williamson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “George Galloway is probably the best orator in the world. He’s now got a place in the corridors of power in Westminster, where the government and the official opposition are effectively facilitating the genocide in Gaza.”

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Galloway’s victory marked “a dark day” for the UK’s Jewish community. A spokesperson said: “George Galloway is a demagogue and conspiracy theorist who has brought the politics of division and hate to every place he has ever stood for parliament.

“His election is a dark day for the Jewish community in this country and for British politics in general. We believe he should be shunned as a pariah by all parliamentarians.”

Ali did not attend the count and the Guardian understands that other Labour campaigners were told to stay away.

Despite a campaign dominated by events in the Middle East, Galloway said he hoped to put together a “grand alliance” with Rochdale councillors to work on local issues.

Dozens of Galloway supporters had gathered outside the leisure centre shortly after the polls closed, when it quickly became apparent he was set for a decisive victory. Inside the count, however, the mood was less hospitable. A family member of a rival candidate muttered “terrorist sympathiser” while another shouted “woe to Rochdale” after he was declared the winner.

Another heckler, who gave her name as Jane Twill, was removed by security after interrupting the victory speech by accusing Galloway of failing to address the climate emergency.

Galloway’s team were so confident that they briefed reporters within an hour of the polls closing that he had won “comfortably” and announced plans for a “mass rally” immediately after the declaration at his election headquarters, a former Suzuki showroom.

Labour, riding high in the polls, had expected a straightforward contest to replace the sitting MP, Tony Lloyd, who died on 17 January from leukaemia. But its campaign was thrown into disarray when it emerged its candidate had repeated anti-Israel conspiracy theories about the 7 October attack by Hamas.

Labour was forced to disown Ali but with his name remaining on the ballot paper – it was too late to select another candidate – Labour stopped all electioneering in the town nearly three weeks ago.

Galloway, on the other hand, was galvanised. The fedora-sporting politician toured Rochdale with a megaphone, calling the byelection “a referendum on Gaza” and a chance to stage a protest against Labour.

His team, backed by an army of volunteers from across the country, managed to capture the vote of a significant number of Muslim people, who make up about 30% of the town’s population, with many angry about Labour’s position on Gaza.

Starmer’s party also faced a challenge from another former Labour MP in the form of Simon Danczuk, who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager. Danczuk, Rochdale’s MP from 2010 to 2017, was standing for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party founded by Nigel Farage.

Danczuk’s new party did poorly, finishing in sixth place with only 6.3% of the vote. A Reform UK source said the party had underperformed because of logistics: the Rochdale contest was the third byelection it had fought in three weeks and it had been focusing on its party conference in Doncaster last weekend.

Galloway, 69, previously unseated his former party in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005 and Bradford West in 2012, both following campaigns based heavily on events in the Middle East.

Like Galloway’s previous campaigns, the Rochdale contest was mired in controversy. In the week when MPs were raising concerns over their safety, Galloway said the names of Labour MPs were “dripping in blood” after the party’s ceasefire amendment, which did not go as far as pro-Palestinian supporters wanted.

Earlier this week, a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sending a death threat to Danczuk, who hired security guards for the final two days of campaigning.

Galloway’s team said its banners and garden posts had been ripped down in an effort to stop it getting the word out.

There were allegations of dirty tricks on polling day too, as Reform UK lodged a formal complaint about Galloway activists distributing leaflets outside polling stations.

Richard Tice, the leader of Reform, claimed the contest had not been “free or fair” and made unspecified suggestions that the postal vote had been rigged.

“This byelection and result should act as a serious wake-up call to those in power and indeed to the entire electorate,” he said. “We are supposed to be a beacon of democracy, this shameful contest has been more characteristic of a failed state.”

Galloway’s team had earlier accused Labour canvassers of speaking to voters inside polling stations.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

His stunning win in Rochdale was his seventh parliamentary victory of a political career in which he has represented four cities and three parties across four decades, equalling Winston Churchill’s constituency-hopping record.

Less Churchillian was his appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006, moonlighting from his day job as the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow by donning a red unitard and pretending to be a cat.

The Rochdale win marks a late political resurrection for Galloway, whose traditional support among British Muslims might not have survived the sectarian dimensions of the Syrian civil war. He denied chemical weapons attacks by the regime and took a job on an Arab television channel said to be linked to Syria’s dictator, Bashar al-Assad.

However, anger over Israel’s offensive in Gaza offered a way back and when he pitched up in Rochdale in February, Galloway did not pretend to have strong links to the Greater Manchester town.

He made a few local promises – to bring back a maternity hospital, as well as a Primark – but his was essentially a single-issue campaign, fought on Palestine and targeted squarely at the Muslims who make up 30% of Rochdale’s population.

He repeatedly invoked religious imagery to win what he called the “ultimate protest vote”. Outside one mosque after Friday prayers, he asked worshippers whether on “judgment day” they would be able to tell their children and grandchildren that they had opposed Keir Starmer’s position on Gaza.

It all felt very familiar to veterans of Galloway’s last byelection win, in Bradford West in 2012, when he was carried aloft from the leisure centre count shouting “All praise to Allah” as a crowd of young Hummer-driving Muslim men chanted: “Viva Palestina!”

During that unpleasant campaign, Galloway annihilated the Labour vote by painting himself as a defender of the oppressed Muslims of Kashmir.

He rarely plays nicely. In the 2015 general election, in which he lost his Bradford seat in a Labour landslide, he was widely criticised after ordering an intermediary in Pakistan to dig out the Islamic marriage certificate of his Labour rival, Naz Shah, in order to try to prove she had been 16, not 15 as she had said, when she was forced into a violent and sexually abusive marriage.

In 2019, after being sacked by TalkRadio for what it called his “antisemitic views”, he tweeted his old bosses to say: “See you in court guys … Long live Palestine.” He was given the boot from the station not long after it had been censured by the media regulator Ofcom for breaching broadcasting impartiality rules when Galloway cast doubt on Russian involvement in the poisoning of Yulia and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury.

Many of those threatened with a libel suit do not go on to find themselves in court. The notable exception is the Telegraph, which ended up paying Galloway £150,000 in damages in 2004 after publishing a report claiming documents found in Baghdad during the Iraq war suggested he had received up to £375,000 a year from his old friend Saddam.

So what can Rochdale expect from their new MP? Not a lot of work inside parliament, if Galloway’s track record is anything to go by. In three years as Bradford West’s MP he spoke just 16 times in the House of Commons, sometimes going for six months or more without saying a word in the debating chamber.

When he did speak in parliament, it was usually about foreign affairs or to insult other MPs, once responding to an intervention from a Tory MP by saying: “I would much prefer to give way to the honourable gentleman than for him to cackle and wobble his ample girth from a sedentary position.”

He did find time to make programmes for Russia Today and al-Mayadeen TV, topping up his MP’s salary by £12,400 a month. His globetrotting was relentless, taking time out from his duties in Bradford and Westminster to campaign for Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and to attend events all over the world.

Controversy was never far away. Shortly after his election in Bradford, Galloway enraged anti-rape campaigners in Bradford when he described sexual assault allegations against the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as merely “bad sexual etiquette”. The investigation into Assange was later dropped.

Born in Dundee, Scotland, in 1954, Galloway became the youngest ever chair of the Scottish Labour party in 1981 and won his first parliamentary seat in Glasgow Hillhead (later Glasgow Kelvin) in 1987.

Always on the far left of the party, he was expelled by Labour in 2003 for bringing the party into disrepute over his prominent opposition to the Iraq war.

He joined the Respect party and in 2005 won the London seat of Bethnal Green and Bow from Labour’s Oona King. Two years later he was suspended from parliament for 18 days after the Commons select committee on standards and privileges found “strong circumstantial evidence” that the UN’s oil for food programme had been used by the Iraqi government with Galloway’s “connivance” to fund the campaigning activities of his charity the Mariam Appeal.

In 2019 the Charity Commission found that Viva Palestina, another charity set up by Galloway, to deliver aid to Gaza, may not have conducted any charitable activity or distributed any humanitarian aid despite claiming to have gathered £1m in public donations.

While Respect fell apart amid rows involving constituent parts such as supporters from the Socialist Workers party and other factions, Galloway was involved in forming a new political vehicle in 2019, the Workers Party of Britain.

It aimed to soak up disillusioned former Corbynists leaving Labour after its 2019 defeat but ultimately it became a Galloway vehicle, with political foot soldiers provided by the CPGB-ML, a Stalinist far-left group that is tiny in number and came with China links.

Galloway was able to make to the most of his new role, addressing the Chinese regime’s second International Forum on Democracy in Beijing, where he quoted Xi Jinping approvingly and criticised “the form of democracy in western countries”.

In an echo of Respect’s splits, the CPGB-ML withdrew but Galloway’s party has recruited figures including Chris Williamson, the former Labour MP who was suspended by that party after he criticised its handling of antisemitism allegations, and Peter Ford, a former UK ambassador to Syria.

The move to sidle up to Beijing was pre-dated by an embrace of Russia, which involved Galloway echoing pro-Kremlin talking points on Ukraine although he threatened to sue what was then called Twitter after the social network labelled his account as “Russian state-affiliated media”. By then his radio programme The Mother of All Talk Shows was being broadcast on the Russian state-owned Sputnik service.

Now back in parliament after a 12-year hiatus, Galloway has hinted he does not plan to spend his 70s as an outcast on the opposition benches. During the Rochdale campaign he repeatedly told voters he may be their MP for only “100 days” or however long until Rishi Sunak calls the next general election.

To others he has suggested he would serve no more than one last full term in parliament. He told his old adversaries at the Telegraph that he was planning his retirement. “I’m 69 years old and my youngest child is three. Well, I really do have obligations to others,” he said. “Having said that, because it’s half-term where they live, all my children are here with me in the campaign. But, no, five more years will do me finally.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A cold wind blew down Whitehall. The streets were nearly empty. The shops boarded up. Just a few veiled women, keeping their heads bowed as they hurried home. Inside 10 Downing Street, the prime minister cowered under his desk. “No more,” he sobbed.

Over in City Hall, Sadiq Khan signed the death warrants of another 50 motorists who had failed to pay the Ulez charge. His original order had been that first offenders should only have both hands cut off, but he had been overruled by the ayatollahs. Sharia law should never be that lenient.

In Threadneedle Street, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, was pacing the vast boardroom. The woman he was expecting, the editor of the Financial Times, was late. On the table were laid out two bandanas and two suicide vests. In under an hour they – and Jeremy Hunt – would both be dead. Well, what would you do? After all that Jezza has done to the economy. The fight back of the deep state starts here.

Still, the caliphate was expanding its reach. Down in the Cotswolds, Boris Johnson was being dragged through the centre of Chipping Norton. In an hour’s time he would be stoned to death. The punishment for adultery. Let him be an example to other politicians. Up in the balcony of the town hall, David Cameron – AKA Lord Big Dave – allowed himself a wry smile. He would be throwing the first stone.

Er … actually, scrub that intro. That was the Lee Anderson and Liz Truss vision of Britain on Monday. It’s now Thursday.

The United Kingdom, February 2024. A cold wind still blew down Whitehall. The streets were also still empty and the shops boarded up. And Rishi Sunak hadn’t moved since Monday. Nobody had managed to talk him out from under his desk.

Out on Oxford Street, a group of murderous terrorists had formed an orderly queue outside Selfridges. They claimed to be waiting for the shop to open so that they could buy the new Call of Duty video game. But Rish! knew better. He alone had attended the Cobra briefing led by Suella Braverman. Before long, some of the terrorists would be waving flags and walking somewhere else. Some might even be smiling and demanding “peace”. Imagine that.

It was the same throughout the rest of this once prosperous land. In the countryside, sheep were lying with donkeys and crops were rotting in the fields. The roads were unpassable, blocked by overturned cars and looted lorries. The sun no longer shone and beggars howled to the skies, their cries unanswered. Bodies lay unburied in the street. And still the mob demanded peace.

James Cleverly was just the latest cabinet member to tiptoe into No 10 via the secret tunnel. It was far too dangerous for him to use the front door. He kept his head down in the corridors in case his movements attracted the attention of a sniper. He needed to coax the prime minister out. He hadn’t been to the toilet for days.

“What do you want?” Rish! sobbed. “Leave me alone! Leave me alone!”

“It’s OK,” said Jimmy Dimly tenderly.

“Is it safe? Is it safe?”

“Is what safe?”

“Is it safe? Is it safe? The country has descended into mob rule. We no longer have a functioning government. By the way, who is the prime minister? And which party has been in power for the last 14 years?”

“You don’t want to know,” said Jimmy D. “But I have a cunning plan. We’re going to let everyone have three protests and then say: ‘You’ve made your point. Enough is enough. Time to go home now and everything will be fine.’”

“You say all the sweetest things, Jimmy,” said Rish!. “I don’t know where I’d be without you.”

Weirdly, this wasn’t a line of reasoning that the security minister, Tom Tugendhat, chose to employ in his statement to the Commons on MPs’ safety. In fact, he got through the whole hour without mentioning the words “mob rule”. Almost as if he was a bit ashamed by his leader. Embarrassed by him. You get the feeling that the end of this parliament can’t come too soon for Tories like Tugendhat.

Instead, Tugendhat just stuck to basics. MPs are increasingly under threat and need protection. No one was going to argue with that. Though he was understandably unwilling to think what might have prompted the surge in death threats. That it might have all kicked off with the coarsening of the debate during the Brexit years. Rightwing newspapers branding MPs and judges as traitors and enemies of the people. And the government just standing by in passive acceptance. Nodding it through.

Back in Downing Street, Jimmy D was still trying to lure Sunak out.

“It’s the big annual Tory fundraiser tonight. The Black and White ball,” Dimly explained. “We need to extract as much dosh as possible with the election coming.”

“What have others given so far?” squeaked Rish!.

“Let me see … Suella has offered a lifelong break in Rwanda. Stay in a two-star hotel. The advance bidding on that has been slow. And Honest Bob Jenrick is offering to help with controversial planning applications. Pornographers especially welcome …”

“And what are you giving?’

“A luxury five-night stay on the Bibby Stockholm, with a banquet dinner cooked by 30p Lee.”

“That’s amazing.”

“In which case I will offer an honorary knighthood. Preferably to someone linked to my father-in-law’s business interests.”

“You’re all heart,” said Jimmy Dimly. “All this giving is very tiring.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

In line with electoral law, Labour cannot replace Ali with another candidate because the deadline passed on 2 February. He will stand as a Labour candidate on the ballot paper, but if elected he will not hold the party whip and will sit as an independent MP.

Labour sources said that campaigners in Rochdale were told to stop leafleting and social media activity on Ali’s behalf at 5.30pm on Monday – an instruction that came from party HQ.

Senior party MPs and members had urged the leadership to confirm Ali would be disciplined if he won the byelection, as comments he had made soon after the 7 October attacks surfaced over the weekend. In them, he suggested Israel had deliberately relaxed security after warnings of an imminent threat.

The Labour MPs and members voiced their concern at the leadership’s continued support of Ali, saying it marked a “huge and disappointing shift” from Starmer’s promises of taking a “zero-tolerance” approach to antisemitism and all forms of racism.

On Monday night, the Daily Mail approached Labour with more comments Ali had made, prompting the party to withdraw its support.

A local Labour insider said that some activists would seriously consider throwing their support behind Simon Danczuk, the disgraced former Labour MP for Rochdale who was suspended from the party after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager.

“Simon may be the best way of keeping [George Galloway, who is running as a Workers party candidate in the byelection] out,” a source said. “It’s the devil and the deep blue sea.”

Danczuk, who is standing for the populist Reform party, said Labour should now take down posters and rip up leaflets supporting Ali, and ensure their activists no longer campaigned for him.

“Labour under Keir Starmer has been campaigning for someone with antisemitic views,” he said. “The party must completely dissociate itself from this candidate. If the party appears to be tacitly supporting him, it will be a disgraceful state of affairs.”

Danczuk’s campaign would now concentrate on stopping Galloway, he said. “My campaign will be to tell the electorate that they will not want an MP who would prioritise Palestine over Rochdale. If elected, I will prioritise Rochdale over Palestine.”

Galloway, who is concentrating on Rochdale’s sizeable Pakistani and Kashmiri Muslim community for votes, is expected to benefit from the row, with some local activists saying that Ali’s suspension makes him favourite to win on 29 February.

The veteran campaigner, who has already been an MP for Respect and Labour, has appealed for voters to help put the plight of the people of Gaza on the map by voting him in.

Any prospect that he could enter parliament again will appal some in the Jewish community. In 2014, he called for Bradford to become an “Israel-free zone”.

Ali had apologised after a recording was leaked to the Mail on Sunday in which he was heard saying: “The Egyptians are saying that they warned Israel 10 days earlier … Americans warned them a day before [that] … there’s something happening. They deliberately took the security off, they allowed … that massacre that gives them the green light to do whatever they bloody want.”

Lisa Nandy, the shadow international development minister, and Anneliese Dodds, the shadow women and equalities secretary, had been out campaigning for Ali in the constituency at the weekend.

The shadow minister Nick Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he believed Ali had fallen “for an online conspiracy theory” and he understood the “gravity of the offence that has been caused”.

A frontbencher said: “This came far too late. The leadership’s continued support could still open the floodgates, allowing many others to think they can get away with antisemitism if they have posed with banners calling for an end to antisemitism.”

Another senior MP added: “What he said passed the threshold of what is acceptable and, if he was a Labour MP, would necessitate suspension of the whip if recent cases are a guide.”

It is understood Ali has also been suspended from the Labour party, pending an investigation.

According to a story published by the Daily Mail on Monday night, Ali said “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” were “giving crap” about Andy McDonald, who was suspended by Labour after he used the controversial phrase “between the river and the sea” in a speech during a rally.

The paper also said the now-former Labour candidate claimed that Israel planned to “get rid of [Palestinians] from Gaza” and “grab” some of the land. It is thought he made the comments at the same meeting as the original story.

“Following new information about further comments made by Azhar Ali coming to light today, the Labour party has withdrawn its support for Azhar Ali as our candidate in the Rochdale byelection,” a Labour spokesperson said.

“Keir Starmer has changed Labour so that it is unrecognisable from the party of 2019. We understand that these are highly unusual circumstances, but it is vital that any candidate put forward by Labour fully represents its aims and values. Given that nominations have now closed, Azhar Ali cannot be replaced as the candidate.”

Rishi Sunak made a direct reference to the scandal during a GB News interview, accusing Starmer of standing by the politician and having “no principles at all”.

“So no, the Labour party hasn’t changed,” he said during a one-hour Q&A with a live audience. “It’s a con.”

A spokesperson for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said: “Sir Keir Starmer has blotted an otherwise fairly admirable copy book and given the public reason to doubt the earnestness of his promise to tear antisemitism out ‘by its roots’ in Labour.

“People will have to judge for themselves whether the additional reported comments by Azhar Ali are really any worse than the comments that had already been reported.

“Rather than appearing as a principled decision, Labour’s withdrawal of support for its candidate at this late stage just looks as expedient as the failed attempt to defend him. It is the worst of all worlds for Labour.”

Last year, Martin Forde KC, the senior lawyer commissioned by Starmer to investigate the Labour party’s culture, criticised the leadership for vowing to take a “zero-tolerance” approach to antisemitism and all other forms of racism without having “transparent systems in place”.

Calling for an independent directorate to oversee Labour’s disciplinary processes, which has since been rejected, Forde said at the time: “I think part of the reason that factionalism has arisen around this is because there is a perception that different groups are treated differently.”

Activists in Rochdale have told of their shock at Ali’s remarks, saying he was known for being an ally and supportive of rooting out antisemitism from the party. They believe this is why the leadership had treated him with sympathy.

Last week, Labour’s shadow Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, challenged prime minister Rishi Sunak to put the country “out of this Tory misery” and call a general election now.

Speaking at the War on Want event in central London, Lynch told the PA news agency: “I think Labour have got a good chance of getting elected unless they muck it up, really.

“If you can’t defeat this government we’ll never get a Labour government again, I would have thought, so he’s got a very good chance of winning.

“That doesn’t mean that we give him carte blanche or a blank cheque to do whatever he likes.”

The boss of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union said campaigners of “all stripes and identities” needed to form an alliance to ensure that politicians, whether Labour or another UK party, “deliver a working-class agenda going forward”.

“I support getting rid of this government and I’m a realist – the only government we’re going to get as an alternative will be led by Keir Starmer, so people have to deal with that, people have got to grow up a bit in some senses.

“That’s the government we’re going to get and we have to make the best of that opportunity.”

Standing outside No 10 late on Friday, the prime minister condemned what he called “a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality” after the 7 October massacre by Hamas and the Israeli invasion of Gaza.

He also claimed democracy itself was a target, as he condemned the election of Galloway, who easily won the seat in Rochdale on a platform that focused on anti-Israel sentiment over Gaza.

However, in a sometimes rambling and seemingly contradictory 10-minute address, Sunak made points likely to anger MPs on the right of the Conservative party such as Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick, who have sought to frame recent tensions as almost entirely the responsibility of Islamist extremists.

Sunak was at pains to stress the recent abuse of Muslim Britons as well as the Jewish community, and to highlight the threat from far-right groups as well as Islamists.

“Don’t let the extremists hijack your marches,” he said, directly addressing those who had taken part in the series of huge protests across the UK.

“You have a chance in the coming weeks to show that you can protest decently, peacefully and with empathy for your fellow citizens. Let us prove these extremists wrong and show them that even when we disagree, we will never be disunited.”

But the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, responded: “The British people will take no lessons from a prime minister and Conservative party who have sowed the seeds of division for years.”

Sunak added: “Yes, you can march and protest with passion, you can demand the protection of civilian life. But no, you cannot call for violent jihad.”

But he failed to address stinging criticism of MPs in his own party, or his own failure to call out their remarks.

He spoke less than a week after Lee Anderson, the former Conservative party deputy chair, had the whip withdrawn following remarks about the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, that were widely condemned as offensive and Islamophobic.

Braverman and Liz Truss have also been criticised and accused of deliberately stoking divisions.

In parts of Sunak’s impromptu speech, which was announced with minimal notice, he painted a picture of political bedlam which some opponents argue is overstated.

“In recent weeks and months, we’ve seen a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality. What started as protests on our streets has descended into intimidation, threats and planned acts of violence,” he said.

“I need to speak to you all this evening because this situation has gone on long enough and demands a response not just from government, but from all of us.”

There were, he said, “forces here at home trying to tear us apart” by taking advantage of the “very human angst that we all feel about the terrible suffering that war brings to the innocent, to women and children, to advance a divisive, hateful ideological agenda”.

The address contained no new policies, beyond a vague commitment for a “robust framework” for government to tackle extremism at its roots.

But Sunak did urge police to make greater use of existing powers to tackle things such as protesters disrupting political meetings or projecting images on to parliament.

He said: “This week, I’ve met with senior police officers and made clear it is the public’s expectation that they will not merely manage these protests, but police them. I say this to the police: we will back you when you take action.”

It was after the meeting with police on Wednesday that Sunak said there was “a growing consensus that mob rule is replacing democratic rule”, an assessment civil liberties groups and others said was concerning and a potential harbinger of even tougher anti-protest laws.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, appeared to back the prime minister’s message calling for unity in the country.

He said: “The prime minister is right to advocate unity and to condemn the unacceptable and intimidatory behaviour that we have seen recently.

“It is an important task of leadership to defend our values and the common bonds that hold us together.

“Citizens have a right to go about their business without intimidation and elected representatives should be able to do their jobs and cast their votes without fear or favour.

“This is something agreed across the parties and which we should all defend.”

Davey said: “This is the same prime minister who made Suella Braverman his home secretary and Lee Anderson his party’s deputy chairman.

“If the prime minister is serious about bringing people together, he would call a general election now so that the British public can decide the future of our country.”

Galloway said he did not understand Sunak’s suggestions that he glorified Hezbollah but hoped they could discuss it next week if the prime minister “has the guts”.

Sunak said the newly elected MP for Rochdale “dismisses the horror of what happened on October 7”, “glorifies Hezbollah” and is “endorsed by Nick Griffin, the racist former leader of the BNP”.

“I’m not responsible for whoever declares they endorse me … I’ve never met Mr Griffin and have no intention to,” Galloway told Channel 5 News.

“I don’t know what the glorifying of Hezbollah is all about but maybe he can tell me on Wednesday at prime minister’s questions if he’s got the guts.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said hefty tax rises and Whitehall spending cuts of 25% were in prospect during the six-year squeeze lasting until 2017 that would follow the chancellor's ""treading water"" budget yesterday.

Asked by the BBC tonight how his plans compared with Thatcher's attempts to slim the size of the state, Darling replied: ""They will be deeper and tougher – where we make the precise comparison I think is secondary to an acknowledgement that these reductions will be tough.""

The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, seized on the first admission by the chancellor that Labour was planning greater austerity than that achieved by Thatcher's chancellors Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson. ""Labour has been found out. Gordon Brown is basing his election campaign on the claim that Labour can go on spending. That is completely blown apart by Alistair Darling's admission, under pressure, that Labour's own budget numbers imply deep cuts. But why didn't he admit that yesterday? Twenty-four hours on, this empty budget has completely unravelled and Labour's failure to act will hit families hard.""

Robert Chote, the IFS's director, said he was wary of the chancellor's claims that he could raise £11bn through efficiency savings, and added that capital investment in Britain's infrastructure would bear the brunt of the cuts. Current Treasury plans implied reductions in capital spending of almost 15% a year for the next four years, Chote said.

The IFS used its post-budget analysis to spell out what was in store for Whitehall departments, but said there appeared to be only a modest difference between the plans of the two main parties.

Assuming that the Conservatives wanted to eliminate Britain's structural deficit over a five-year parliament, a David Cameron government would have to find an extra £8bn of savings.

The thinktank said Labour's plans implied a cumulative decline of 11.9% in departmental spending on public services and administration over four years, a cut of £46bn in inflation-adjusted terms.

But a two-year government pledge to protect spending on the NHS and schools, and to raise overseas aid to the UN target of 0.7% of national output, will result in deeper cuts of 20% for those departments not protected, the IFS said. If the government continued to spare health and education for a further two years, departments such as transport, defence and the Home Office would face budget reductions of 25%.

The IFS said that the planned austerity would reduce public spending as a share of the economy from just over 27% to below 21% and return it to its level in the late 1990s, when it began a decade-long rise. A government that wanted to slash the deficit without inflicting such deep cuts would have to raise taxes or reduce welfare payments instead, the IFS added.

Chote said there was a lack of clarity about how either Labour or the Conservatives planned to tackle deficit reduction. ""There are an awful lot of judgments still be made, or revealed, notably with regards to public spending over the next parliament. This greater-than-necessary vagueness allows the opposition to be vaguer than necessary, too.""

The budget, Chote added, had failed to provide a detailed picture to voters and the financial markets of the ""fiscal repair job"" in prospect after the election.

""Of the £46bn a year of real cuts in public services spending that we think budget forecasts would require by 2014-15, the government would presumably claim to have 'found' about £20bn by 2012-13 from pay restraint, cutting programmes and efficiency savings. We should be wary of some of these claims, particularly on efficiency.

""First, because it is not obvious that the efficiency savings would be delivered. Second, and more fundamentally, if they are cutting out genuine waste we would expect the government to try to achieve most of these efficiencies even if it was not having to cut public spending overall.""

The IFS said that the slight improvement in the state of the public finances in recent months had reduced the size of the structural budget deficit – borrowing that will not be eliminated by faster growth – from £73bn before the budget to £67bn.

Chote said: ""Presented with this good news, the chancellor had a choice: to give away his good luck in pre-election bribes, or to bank it and bring government borrowing down more quickly as the recovery takes hold. Perhaps in the face of pressure to do otherwise by the ""forces of hell"", he has sensibly chosen to do the latter.""","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

On Monday morning Oliver Dowden distanced himself from the Cyber First campaign, which resurfaced on the same day his department was celebrating awarding £257m in funding to struggling venues and organisations.

Dowden tweeted that the ad campaign, which is backed by the government and promotes retraining in tech, did not come from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), while reiterating that he wanted to “save jobs in the arts”.

The advert depicts a ballet dancer tying her shoes, with the caption “Fatima’s next job could be in tech”, which critics said was in bad taste considering thousands of jobs are being lost in the culture sector. The campaign promises to equip people “with the essential cyber skills needed to set you on a rewarding career path”.

Critics said the campaign represented “cultural philistinism and bad governance in one ad”, while others said it “pretty much sums up what this [government] thinks of the arts”.

A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “This particular piece of content was not appropriate and has been removed from the campaign. The government recognises the challenge to the cultural industry.”

The row is particularly embarrassing for the government because it comes on the same day that the DCMS released details of 1,300 organisations that will share £257m in funding from its £1.57bn arts support package that was originally announced in July.

On a day when the DCMS was being celebrated by many in the arts for providing funding that was described as a “lifeline”, Dowden had to make it clear that he disagreed with a campaign backed by his own government.

“This was a partner campaign encouraging people from all walks of life to think about a career in cybersecurity. I want to save jobs in the arts, which is why we are investing £1.57bn,” Dowden tweeted.

The author Caitlin Moran responded: “I don’t know if the government know they appear to have recently created a ‘Hopes & Dreams Crushing Department’, but for a country already depressed and anxious, I would suggest it’s a bit of a ‘Not now, dudes’ moment?”

The shadow mental health minister, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, tweeted: “Fatima, you be you. Don’t let anyone else tell you that you aren’t good enough because you don’t conform to their preconceived social norms.”

Charlotte Bence, from the Equity trade union, said: “Fatima doesn’t need to retrain – what Fatima needs is adequate state support as a freelance artist, support that so far she has been lacking. Freelance workers deserve better than patronising adverts telling them to go and work elsewhere.”

Earlier the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, denied encouraging workers in the struggling arts industry to retrain. He insisted he was talking generally about the need for some workers to “adapt”, and suggested there would be “fresh and new opportunities” available for people who could not do their old jobs.

According to Arts Council England, the arts and culture industry contributes more than £10bn a year to the UK economy.

The government’s messaging aimed at those working in the arts sector has been heavily criticised in recent weeks. After Sunak’s winter economy plan was released with a focus on “viable” jobs, many in the arts expressed anger at the government appearing to suggest their roles were “luxurious hobbies” that could be given up for other work.

Figures including Liam Gallagher, Lily Allen and Ian Rankin all criticised the government, with the Scottish author saying the suggestion that jobs in the arts were not viable was “nuts”.

The singer and DJ Tim Burgess wrote in the Guardian that the chancellor’s messaging suggested thousands of hopeful musicians should abandon their nascent careers.

“It felt as if the chancellor was rebranding the arts sector as some sort of luxurious, decadent hobby, and now it was time for everyone to get their hands dirty – perhaps literally, as we are very short of people to pick fruit,” he wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Gove, an Aberdonian who is now the most prominent Scot in the UK government, said Scotland’s institutions had been neglected by the SNP because it had focused so heavily on the constitution at the expense of public services.

“We have to look at their record, their stewardship of the essential elements of Scottish civic and public life. And it is a devastatingly depressing story,” he told delegates at a Scottish Conservative party fringe meeting.

“Every single one of the institutions that makes Scotland great and makes us proud to be Scots has been run down under the SNP Scottish government and it’s been run down because of their relentless unilateral focus on division, separatism and re-asking a constitutional question which was supposed to have been settled for a generation in 2014.”

His speech, which delighted delegates, came as fresh polling evidence emerged about the significant electoral challenge the Scottish Tories face at the general election when they defend seven Westminster seats.

The latest poll for the Scottish Electoral Study found that 58% of former Tory voters in Scotland now expected to vote for other parties, with a significant number switching to Labour. In October 2023, the same study put that defection rate at 42%.

Last week, a Survation poll found Scottish Tory support in a Westminster vote had slumped to 15%, nearly half the support for the Conservatives in early 2020.

Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, said the Scottish Tories needed to focus on the UK government’s record of investing in Scotland in the runup to the election. It had spent several hundred million pounds through the levelling-up fund in towns such as Dumfries, Elgin and Aberdeen, which had been “overlooked and undervalued” by the SNP.

The nationalists, he said, frequently focused on ill-considered policies designed to divide the UK, such as on a botched bottle-and-can return scheme, on a gender recognition bill thrown out by the courts and on refusing initially to follow England and Wales by banning XL bully dogs, before reversing that decision.

Gove said: “We believe in partnership, we believe that we are better together, we believe in a better future for everyone in Scotland and the United Kingdom.

“And that was the contrast between us and the Scottish government. We believe in the power of the union. They believe in separation, division and denigration.”

The Scottish Election Study’s data shows Tory switchers are deserting the party because they are angry about the UK government’s performance and competence at Westminster, a theme one MSP said was being picked up by frustrated Tory canvassers.

Critics of the Tories point to cuts in social security benefits fuelling an increase in poverty and the cost of living crisis, and argue that Scotland was entitled to stage a second independence referendum because the Brexit vote dramatically changed the case for remaining in the UK.

Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, said there was, however, strong evidence the Conservative vote was holding up in its core areas. It had won two recent council byelections, in Dunblane and Bridge of Allan, and in Jedburgh, with substantial increases in vote share.

Ross believes the Scottish Tories can capitalise on rising discontent with the SNP government in Edinburgh by making the general election a referendum on SNP competence, rather than focusing on Labour’s rise under Keir Starmer.

He told delegates that disgruntled voters should use the Tories “as your vehicle to make the SNP pay for years of distraction and neglect”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Sadiq Khan has been receiving police protection, usually reserved for a handful of senior cabinet ministers or royals, since 2017.

A source with knowledge of the security arrangements said that as well as currently facing threats of violence from the extreme far right, Khan also faces threats from Islamist extremists.

London’s mayor was vocal in denouncing Islamist terrorism when the city was subject to two Jihadist attacks in 2017, after the subsequent attack on Manchester, and when a far-right extremist targeted worshippers leaving a London mosque.

Khan, the first Muslim mayor of the capital, has a team of about 15 police protection officers protecting him around the clock.

Some Islamist extremists see Muslims in public office in western democracies as potential targets. As an MP, Khan voted for same-sex marriage and has championed gay rights as mayor.

It also emerged on Tuesday that a man had pleaded guilty to making threats against Khan after Lee Anderson’s comments.

Christopher Massey, 52, from Ipswich, twice called the control room of Suffolk constabulary.

The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed he had pleaded guilty on Monday to two counts of sending communication threatening death or serious harm.

The threat was made on Saturday. The charge against Massey said that in the phone call to police he had “conveyed a threat of death or serious harm to another, intending or being reckless as to whether an individual encountering the message would fear that the threat would be carried out”.

Massey is scheduled to be sentenced on 21 March at Ipswich magistrates court for the offences under the 2023 Online Safety Act.

A source close to the mayor of London said: “Sadiq faces threats from a wide range of sources.

The prime minister has been accused of “pandering to extremists” by farmers and wildlife groups, who have asked him to “listen to reason and logic” rather than conspiracy theories.

Sunak has been making a concerted effort to improve his party’s standing in rural areas after polling showed the majority of countryside seats are likely to be lost to Labour and the Liberal Democrats at the next general election. Last week, he gave the keynote address at the National Farmers’ Union conference where he told farmers “I have your back.”

On Friday, he attended a farmers’ protest against the Welsh Labour government, which is proposing to bring in a new payments scheme in which farmers will have to prove 10% of their land is woodland and 10% of it is quality habitat for wildlife. He appeared alongside farmer Gareth Wyn Jones and stood next to placards emblazoned with the logo for the campaign “No Farmers No Food”.

Wyn Jones is a leading supporter of the campaign, which was started and is being run by James Melville, a GB News pundit and communications consultant.

Sunak joined in the protest, along with Andrew RT Davies the Welsh Conservatives leader, telling those assembled with their tractors that they had been “treated as Labour’s laboratory”. Speaking to Wyn Jones, he said the new subsidies scheme was “absolutely not right, the impact it will have on your jobs, your livelihoods, your incomes and food production around the country. It’s simply wrong.”

The No Farmers No Food campaign is anti net-zero and has shared conspiracy theories about climate change action, while Melville has questioned the effects of climate breakdown as well as sharing conspiracy theories about net zero.

Its manifesto accuses the UK government of having an “obsession with net zero” and calls for it to end climate measures.

The Twitter/X account for the group shared a conspiracy theory that the World Economic Forum (WEF) is going to force people to eat bugs to reach net zero, retweeting a post from former LBC host Maajid Nawaz that said: “Farmers stand between us and WEF’s desire for us to EAT BUGS, own nothing and be happy.” Melville also shared a post with the conspiracist claim which stated: “Between Bill Gates, the CCP & the WEF, we’re going to have no private farmland left. They want you eating bugs.”

Melville has also shared fake news that local councils are forcing people into “climate lockdowns” and added: “Endless project fear. Very similar vibes on climate/net zero given off by the same people who pushed for lockdowns. And similar vilification issued against anyone who dares to question the narrative.”

Craig Bennett, CEO of the Wildlife Trusts, said the prime minister’s appearance at the protest was “deeply worrying”, adding: “Rather than pandering to extremists who don’t know what they’re talking about, Sunak should be talking to the farmers who are doing their utmost to alleviate biodiversity loss and the impacts of climate change. It would be nice if the prime minister paid a bit more attention to science, reason and logic.”

Arable farmer Martin Lines, CEO of the Nature Friendly Farming Network added: “We are already seeing significant impacts to our businesses and food production because of climate change and all the science says it is going to get significantly worse if we don’t reduce emissions. I find it very disappointing that the prime minister has gone to a protest for a group where one of their key asks is no to net zero measures.”

A government spokesperson did not address the claims, but said: “We are on the side of farmers and – just this week – we announced a major new package of support for rural communities to protect British farming for the next generation.

“This includes the largest ever grant offer for farmers in the coming financial year, expected to total £427m, including an unprecedented package of funding for technology and productivity schemes.”

Melville told the Observer: “These are individual views and not to do with the campaign which includes a lot of different credible people. The farming campaign is not a slavish obsession with net zero, far from it. It is to point out a number of key issues.”

On the opinions about climate lockdowns and the WEF forcing people to eat bugs, he said: “Every individual has a number of different viewpoints that they can openly express without being accused of being a conspiracy theorist.” He added that these climate views are not related to the farming campaign but are personal views.

Don’t panic” more than a hastily arranged speech from the prime minister outside No 10 at 5.45pm on a Friday. Still, on the plus side, those who chose to carry on watching Pointless on BBC One won’t have missed a thing. It would have been hard to tell the two apart.

Rishi Sunak is the politician’s anti-politician. If he ever came close to a real politician, he might dissolve on contact. Just as well there are so few of them in his cabinet. You could almost call it a talent – the unerring ability to do the wrong thing. To strike the wrong tone. To misjudge the situation. Every time you think things couldn’t get any worse, Rish! appears to say: “Hold my Coke.”

This was meant to be Sunak at his most impassioned. Bringing the country together at what he thought was a time of crisis. Whether the election of George Galloway, thanks to the stupidity of Labour, really is a crisis is open to question. Clearly it’s a lot less than desirable. But a crisis?

Galloway is just one of politics’ natural gobshites. The left’s version of Nigel Farage. A man whose prime cause is himself and who exists in a narcissistic bubble of trouble-making. A little man who gets off on division. Shakespeare’s words “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing” could have been written for him. To treat him any more seriously is to indulge him.

There was no real argument to Sunak’s speech. Nor was there any real rhetorical power. He is a prime minister unfortunately blessed with levitas. It’s almost impossible to take what he is saying seriously.

Least of all in his speech was any policy. Sunak just wanted to spend 10 minutes sharing his innermost fears with the nation without offering any solutions. Something he might have been better off doing with his therapist. If he hasn’t got one, he should find one urgently.

The longer Sunak went on, the more desperate and the less effectual he sounded. And he was starting with a very low bar

What shone through his words was the absence. There was a hollow, a vacuum at the core of his message. Because what he was really crying out for was for someone – something – to come and take control.

He wanted a government. He wanted a leader to make him feel safe. Because deep down, he knows he is not that man. As a prime minister, he is a fraud. At its most Freudian, this was Sunak’s primal scream for his daddy.

Rish! approached the lectern trying to look purposeful. Though mostly just relieved that the rain had momentarily held off and he wasn’t going to get soaked. He began by describing the problem. Extremism was on the rise in the country. On the far left and on the far right.

There was an increase in antisemitism. Jewish children afraid to walk to school. And an increase in hatred against Muslims, with women abused in the streets. There were threats to MPs in parliament. And now – the final straw – there was the election of Galloway in Rochdale. Democracy was now under threat.

Weirdly, it never seemed to have occurred to Sunak to ask himself why this all might be happening on his watch. Such a lack of intellectual curiosity in a man who prides himself on being clever is breathtaking. Perhaps the denial is too great. Perhaps it needs to be; otherwise he could not get through the day.

Let’s do the work for him. Let’s start with Brexit. Because that’s where political discourse in the country started to become more polarised and violent. Where was Rish! when the Daily Mail and the Telegraph called judges and remainer MPs “traitors” and “enemies of the people”? Cheering the newspapers on. That’s where.

Where was Rish! when Boris Johnson upended centuries of accepted parliamentary procedure with the illegal prorogation? Cheerfully nodding it through. So forgive us if we don’t take Sunak as a democratic role model.

Fast forward a few years. To Rish!’s term in office. Inviting Suella Braverman to be home secretary despite her being found to have broken the ministerial code. Minutes after Sunak promised to govern with “professionalism, integrity and accountability”.

Then the prolonged attacks on refugees and minorities. The othering of people who couldn’t defend themselves. Just because he imagined it would go down well with the right wing of the Tory party. He practically introduced a daily 15 minute hate. George Orwell would have been horrified.

Then to the present. A former prime minister, Liz Truss, who peddles conspiracy theories about the Bank of England being infiltrated by the deep state. Sunak just smiles indulgently.

As he does with Lee Anderson. Rish! may have suspended 30p Lee but the body language indicates that he is still welcome. This from Anderson, who unrepentantly insists that the democratically elected London mayor is colluding with Muslim extremists. That London is in effect under sharia law. They’re the fantasies of a not very bright far-right droid. But Rish! essentially lets it go. Unable to say the I word: Islamophobia.

On and on Sunak went about how the UK was close to breaking point. Does it feel that way to you? There was one laugh-out-loud moment when he appealed to those marching for peace not to let their protests be hijacked by extremists.

Just a week ago, the prime minister was at a Welsh farmers’ protest that was hijacked by some climate crisis denial extremists. And Rish! was happy to have his photo taken with them. You couldn’t make this stuff up.

The longer Sunak went on, the more desperate and the less effectual he sounded. And he was starting with a very low bar. We were basically a nice country, he said. Don’t let it be ruined by extremist idiots. Well, quite. He could start with those close to him.

Democracy was increasingly fragile and needed protecting. Yup. Now remind me who elected the current prime minister. Or the one before that. Oh, that’s right. No one.

This can’t go on. If Sunak really wants to know why the country feels as if it’s falling apart, it’s because we haven’t got a functioning government. All that he did get right was “enough is enough”. It is. Time for an election.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The unknown bidder won the exclusive dinner for themselves and three other people during the event at the five-star Raffles hotel in Westminster, which was attended by Rishi Sunak and several of his cabinet ministers.

The prize was one of five multi-thousand-pound lots auctioned during the invitation-only event, sources said. Other lots included a five-night stay at a Caribbean villa owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Bassim Haidar, a seven-night stay at a manor house in Barbados, a box at York races and a signed photograph of the cabinet.

The event is further evidence of the Conservatives’ continued ability to attract significant donations even as they trail Labour in the polls by about 20 points. The party brought in just under £16m in donations in the third quarter of last year, three times as much as Labour.

Labour’s Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, said: “As ever, the one place in Britain that remains oblivious to the cost of living crisis is the inner circle of the Conservative party. When Jeremy Hunt delivers his budget in a few days’ time and says there are no extra funds available to mend our broken public services, we will remember where his true priorities lay this week.”

The Conservative Winter Party, once known as the Black and White Ball, is a staple in the party’s fundraising calendar. Thursday night’s event was attended by several millionaire donors, including Haidar, who arrived in a personalised Rolls-Royce.

A Conservative spokesperson said the party was not going to comment on the ball, describing it as a private fundraising event.

Haidar, a Nigerian-born Lebanese entrepreneur whose business empire includes a financial services company and investments in medical cannabis, has become an increasingly prominent Tory donor in the last year. In 2023 he gave more than £320,000 to the party, £75,000 to the failed London mayoral candidate Moz Hossain and £10,000 worth of advertising to Lee Anderson, the recently suspended former Tory MP.

Haidar has attracted attention in part for his luxury lifestyle, which includes a fleet of yachts. The entrepreneur told Boat International magazine in December that his lifestyle at one point resembled the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.

Other high-rolling guests included Mohamed Mansour, the billionaire businessman and former Egyptian transport minister, and Henry Angest, the Swiss-born British banker.

The event raised more than £200,000 for the party, including a bumper winning bid of £110,000 for the signed photo of the cabinet. The stay at Haidar’s beach house raised £50,000 while one at the Caribbean estate known as Colleton Great House raised £30,000.

Sunak was among those to give speeches during the night, and personally presented the cabinet photograph to the winning bidder. Despite the high-profile guest list, one person who was there said the overall mood of the night was “downbeat”, reflecting the Tories’ perilous poll position less than a year from a general election.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The veteran campaigner George Galloway is the bookies’ favourite to win after Labour abandoned its candidate over inflammatory comments he made about Israel.

Galloway, the former Labour MP, has described the poll as “a referendum on Gaza” and sought to capture the votes of thousands of disaffected Muslims.

Labour had expected to increase its 9,668-vote majority in the Greater Manchester town until it emerged that its candidate, Azhar Ali, had repeated anti-Israel conspiracy theories about the 7 October attack by Hamas.

Ali will still be on the ballot paper – it was too late to select another candidate – but he will sit as an independent MP if he wins. The result is expected at around 3am on Friday.

The byelection was called after the death of Rochdale’s MP, Sir Tony Lloyd, from leukaemia on 17 January.

Labour enjoys an average 20-point lead in the national opinion polls and was riding high on the success of the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections earlier this month, both of which it won from the Tories with double-digit swings.

00:04:09 A view from Rochdale: ‘Democracy has gone out of the window’ – video

But what was expected to be a straightforward contest to replace Lloyd was thrown into disarray when Ali’s comments were published by the Mail on Sunday on 11 February. He had suggested Israel had deliberately relaxed security after warnings of an imminent threat.

Labour, which has held Rochdale since 2010, hopes that enough of its supporters will vote for the party on Thursday to stop Galloway, although byelections always have lower turnouts than nationwide polls.

Sir Keir Starmer’s party faces a challenge from another former Labour MP in the form of Simon Danczuk, who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager.

Danczuk was Rochdale’s MP from 2010 to 2017 and is standing for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party presided over by Nigel Farage.

The two other main parties, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, are not expected to mount a serious challenge, while Labour’s vote is expected to be split further between a handful of local independent candidates.

Galloway, 69, is expected to be the main beneficiary of the chaos having campaigned on a pro-Palestine ticket aimed at Rochdale’s Muslim community, which accounts for about 30% of the population.

It would be the third time the veteran agitator has unseated his former party after victories in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005 and Bradford West in 2012.

Like his previous campaigns, the Rochdale contest has been mired in controversy. Galloway last week said the names of Labour MPs were “dripping in blood” after the party’s ceasefire amendment, which did not go as far as some pro-Palestine supporters wanted.

The four-week contest has been mired in controversy. Earlier this week a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sending a death threat to Danczuk, who hired security guards for the final two days of campaigning.

Galloway’s team said its banners and garden posts had been ripped down in an effort to stop it getting the word out.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

It’s unlikely, I think, that George Galloway would have been very many people’s second choice in the Rochdale byelection, had they been given the chance to express a preference (Report, 1 March). So 39.7% support is a “great victory”. Like the 43.6% that gave Boris Johnson his “vast mandate” in 2019. Let’s hear it for our outdated electoral system: giving people the MPs they don’t want since 1832.

Maybe they all fell on their heads at the same tea party while they were overdosing on sugar. Because this week’s prime minister’s questions turned into a total embarrassment. One that was cheered on by frontbenchers such as Johnny Mercer and Jeremy Hunt, who are too half-witted to understand what they are watching.

The Tory party has been unravelling for a while now. Arguably since 2010. But there’s no denying that the pace has ramped up significantly in recent months. Now it’s almost impossible to keep up. We seem to get through three or four news cycles between breakfast and lunch. If you stop paying attention for more than an hour, you are hopelessly lost. No chance of catching up. The world becomes a mystery.

Try making sense of the appearance of Lee Anderson in the chamber. You might have been under the impression that 30p Lee had been suspended from the party. Persona non grata. Though what for is another question. You’ll find any number of ministers saying what he did was wrong. Totally unacceptable. Yet they become confused when asked to explain the nature of the wrong. “Er … I don’t know. It’s just … wrong.”

But Anderson walked into the Commons without a care in the world. All smiles, backslapping his mates. Before heading straight back to his normal place between Andrea Jenkyns and Dean Russell. They could not have looked more pleased, either. Thrilled – honoured, even – that their old mucker had come to join them. Other Tory MPs soon gathered round to celebrate the return of the prodigal son. A man more sinned against than sinning. Suspended on a Saturday and welcomed back on Wednesday. Just like it never happened.

If only the same could be said of PMQs itself. This was one for the masochists. An existential tour de farce that meant nothing. Just 30 minutes of mindless posturing. Exchanges that were cheered noisily but meant nothing. The speaker is badly damaged after last week’s Gaza debate – before, he would have at least tried to keep order; now he lets MPs do as they please. At the heart of government there is only a vacuum into which any form of intelligent life has long since been sucked in.

Keir Starmer went in on the attack. Highlighting how far the Tory party has veered to the right. How many of its traditional supporters would now find it impossible to vote for Rishi Sunak’s rabble. He talked of how the Tories were living in a fantasy world. One where the country was controlled by a shadowy “deep state” run by the Bank of England and the Financial Times. Where all the major cities were under sharia law. Where public stonings were a daily occurrence. Where Tommy Robinson was hailed as a hero in the presence of Liz Truss, with no response. Yet another action with no comeback.

“You’re spineless, hopeless and utterly shameless,” yelled Rish!, a paragon of confected rage. Everything about Sunak is artifice because he doesn’t really believe in anything any more. He did once believe in himself. What self-respecting techbro, Master of the Universe, wouldn’t? Only everything around him has turned to shit. There’s nothing left he can do to persuade people to back him. He’s a pointless, empty vessel. One of the few members of the cabinet self-aware enough to experience the pain of his own futility. To know that everything he does is wrong.

But the Tory MPs loved it. This was the first time they had seen any sign of life from their leader in months. Normally he just flatlines his way through PMQs. Now at least there was some fight. Though they were way too dim to realise that all the movement was the last throes of a fish out of water.

Worst still, the Conservative party is dying with him. Sunak is no longer a leader. He’s given up trying to give his MPs direction. Now he’s just a follower, going in whatever direction he is taken. A ship without a sail. MPs like 30p Lee and Radon Liz call the shots now. That’s why no Tory dares to mention the words Islamophobia or racism. The Tories are in danger of being institutionally blind to their Islamophobia. Lee’s words have become acceptable.

So now we entered a shouting contest. Your party is racist, said Starmer. No, you’re the racist, squealed Rish!, as they were surrounded by mindless noise. Anyone who dared point out that the emperor had no clothes was dismissed as a woke virtue signaller.

Yet every time Sunak spoke he merely emphasised the unbearable lightness of his being. Too detached from reality – a parliamentary helium balloon – to realise that every criticism he made of Starmer was better aimed at himself. The mirror was playing tricks with his reality. It was his reflection that he saw all along. The man he really hated was staring back at him.

The accusations were threadbare. A surrealist fantasy. Starmer was too weak to throw Jeremy Corbyn out the party even though he had suspended him years ago. The three ex-Labour members standing in Rochdale? All signs of racism in the Labour party. Even though none were now backed by Labour.

And what of Sunak’s own record? He had happily served in a corrupt government under Boris Johnson. The party he belongs to has been accused of covering up complaints of sexual assault by its own MPs. But hey! That’s just Rish! – a man who likes to do the right thing.

Sunak looked thrilled with himself. He imagined himself to be a macho competitor. But the public just saw him as what he is. Tetchy, thin-skinned and whiny. Anything but a statesman. Weirdly though, this was him at his best.

This is how Rish! wants to be seen in the run-up to the election. He knows he doesn’t have a record to defend. The economy is in recession. Debt is rising. There will be no miracle in next week’s budget. There is no substance to Sunak. So far better to fight imaginary culture wars. Tear down a world that doesn’t exist. Embrace the racism that dare not speak its name.

In the meantime, at future PMQs, Starmer may be better off engaging with reality.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

One of those was Lisa McKenzie, the daughter and granddaughter and great-granddaughter of Nottinghamshire miners, who turned 16 on the first day of the strike. Among other memories, McKenzie, now 55, recalled with a grin the time when a group calling themselves the Cambridge University Feminist Players had got in touch, back then, and wanted to come and do a play for the women of the pit village, in a show of solidarity.

When the students arrived they insisted that only women could watch their performance. “None of the women liked that, and none of the men liked it either,” McKenzie recalled. The play itself, she said, was “every bit as bad as you could imagine: all avant garde and flounce.” As a finale, the student actors turned their backs to the audience and when they turned around their faces were blackened with coal dust. They held hands and announced: “One day all sisters will unite – and work side-by-side down the pits with their men!” McKenzie was open-mouthed recalling this, as her home-permed self had been open-mouthed first time around. “What that showed us,” she said, 40 years on, “is that they just didn’t understand us at all.”

That persistent truth hasn’t, of course, stopped writers and film-makers and artists and poets, not many of them sons or daughters of miners, from trying to tell the story of mining and ex-mining communities ever since. The BBC documentary, and the three-part Channel 4 series that preceded it last month, Miners’ Strike 1984: The Battle for Britain, are the latest expressions of what has become a national ritual, an alternative remembrance day, marking the dispute, decade by decade, when “Britain changed for ever”.

The passage of time seems only to add poignancy to those acts of homage, to the stations of the cross at Easington and Ollerton and Orgreave. This time around the cameras dwelt on the faces of old men whose whole working life might have been spent below ground, but which instead had been spent in daylight, scratching around for piecemeal jobs, or benefits, or structure and certainty, in towns and villages that had been stripped – gradually and then suddenly – of their original purpose.

The fascination with documenting those lives, wanting to walk in miners’ boots, has a long history. George Orwell set the pattern when he was dispatched from his day job at a Hampstead bookshop in 1936 by his publisher Victor Gollancz to live among the miners of Lancashire and Yorkshire for the book that became The Road to Wigan Pier. The Old Etonian prepared by scuffing his brogues and dirtying his jacket and trying to rough up his accent. His book dramatised, in part, all the ingrained ironies of that quest: “In a way it is even humiliating to watch coal miners working,” he wrote, drily. “It raises in you a momentary doubt about your own status as an ‘intellectual’ and a superior person generally. It is brought home to you, at least while you are watching, that it is only because miners sweat their guts out that superior persons can remain superior.”

The miners he met were, equally, in no doubt of their relative status. Orwell may have had received pronunciation, but they had authenticity: “It is only in the North that life is ‘real’ life,” Orwell was invited to understand, and “that the industrial work done in the North is the only ‘real’ work, that the North is inhabited by ‘real’ people, the South merely by rentiers and their parasites.”

The interviewees in the two recent documentaries seemed pretty sure of that distinction nearly 90 years on (and you could, too, hear an echo of Orwell’s southern insecurities in the occasional reedy-voiced off-screen questions of the programme-makers). What had been lost, the ex-miners implied, when the pits were shut down, was not so much a way of life as that whole confidence in what was real and what was fake. The mine at Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where the Channel 4 series focused, had been replaced by a vast Sports Direct warehouse. As Lisa McKenzie concluded: “The pit was life, it was everything. We might not have had much money, but we were honest folk. Love and safety and security: 1984 to 1985 removed all of that.”

That abiding faith was the motivating force of the strike from the beginning. Ken Loach’s 1984 film Which Side Are You On? set the gritty romance of those threatened communities in stone. His camera captured not only the frontlines of the picket, but the poets and balladeers of the struggle playing benefits in pubs and clubs. “Tears too are now redundant,” one such pit-poet concluded. “Who am I to ask them why this pit must live, this pit must die?” another man inquired. Loach spliced those lyrical moments with the running battles of picketing miners: scenes of cars turned back on motorways blockaded by newly militarised police; the arms of broad shouldered pitmen twisted up their backs as they are bundled into paddy wagons; the police cavalry charges at Orgreave.

Watching those latter sequences again now, some images seem to merge with memories of Jeremy Deller’s 2001 reconstruction of the same events for an art project. Deller, the Turner prize winner, who was at school in Dulwich, south London at the time of the strike itself, used re-enactment societies and ex-miners for his film to emphasise, lest we forget, that this recent history had been our civil war and our Agincourt, all in one.

The latest films and documentaries on the strike, like those that went before, are sometimes tempted to portray those clashes as part of a straightforward class war – workers against the capitalist state – but they were, on the ground, equally internecine conflicts, pit against pit. Reading back through the first draft of history in the Observer, those latter fault lines were apparent from the very beginning.

On 11 March 1984, the Observer reported the initial walk out at Cortonwood pit in Yorkshire, under the heading “Miners Deeply Split” above a story about the refusal of the NUM leader, Arthur Scargill, to grant members a national ballot “on the basis that there were grave doubts as to whether the required 55% vote in favour of strike action could be achieved”. Those doubts never went away over the following 12 months, not least in the mind of Scargill himself, who attempted to assume national consensus in the union without that mandate.

Neil Kinnock maintained that ‘the suicidal vanity of Arthur Scargill’ made the catastrophic defeat of the strike inevitable

The following week, the paper reported from Thoresby colliery in Nottinghamshire, which had been targeted by flying pickets from Yorkshire, seeking to persuade or intimidate the Notts miners into walking out. One working miner railed at how “Scargill… is turning miner against miner. Every man must enjoy the democratic right to vote on whether he should go on strike or not. Scargill wants to use us as cannon fodder to bring down this government. I tell you if he were to turn up here, we’d string him up from the nearest lamp-post.”

At nearby Ollerton, in street battles, one young Yorkshireman died. “Yorkshire pickets with football scarves around their necks taunted the Notts men with charges of cowardice,” the paper reported. “The Yorkshiremen accused the Nottinghamshire moderates of not being ‘real men’, of hiding behind their women, of failing to stand up when the crunch came. The chanting had all the savage edge of a football crowd on the rampage.”

It is seductive, knowing how things turned out, to only view that history in black and white, comrades against strikebreakers. Looking back over depictions of the strike year by year is to watch voices for compromise quietly erased in favour of that simpler binary. One figure whose stance appears less and less in anniversary documentaries is Neil Kinnock, Labour leader at the time of the strike, born into a South Wales mining community, and engaged in 1984 in a battle for the future of his party with the hard left Militant group. In Marching to the Fault Line, Francis Beckett and David Hencke’s peerless account of the secret political manoeuvring of the strike, Kinnock emerges as a rare voice of reason. At the launch of that book, on the 25th anniversary of the strike in 2009, Kinnock doubled down on his opinion that “the suicidal vanity of Arthur Scargill” had made the catastrophic defeat of the strike inevitable. “A ballot would have been won for the strike,” Kinnock insisted. “And what it would have done is guarantee unity right across the mining labour force.”

Scargill, he suggested, preyed on the strength of self-sacrifice in the community in order to “feed himself the political illusion that as long as the miners were united they had the right to destabilise and overthrow the democratically elected government. The miners didn’t deserve him, they deserved much, much better. My view is Margaret Thatcher and Arthur Scargill deserved each other. But no one else did.”

That narrative, far more widespread at the time than the history now tends to believe, was no doubt the reason why Margaret Thatcher could look in the mirror and tell herself she was defending democracy when she was using covert and draconian strategies to provoke and break the strike. Forty years on, two seconds of footage of Thatcher in any of the latest documentaries, repeating her determination to defeat “the enemy within”, or to defend liberty with battalions of riot police, should still come with a trigger warning to anyone who sat through those broadcasts in real time. The patronising grate of the voice, the impervious certainty, the hair (mirrored by Scargill’s bouffant) still have the effect of a thousand nails down a blackboard.

For these reasons – and despite her landslide electoral successes either side of 1984-5 – Mrs T has been the cold-hearted villain of just about all popular depictions of those events ever since. It was never enough for the most vocal striking miners to want the prime minister defeated, they wanted their tormentor safely dispatched underground, to be sure she had gone. Mark Herman’s 1996 film Brassed Off, about the Grimethorpe Colliery Band playing on while their pit faced closure, established that sentiment: “What’s [God] doing?” Stephen Tomkinson’s character asks at one point, “He can take John Lennon. He can take those three young lads down at Ainsley Pit. He’s even thinking of taking my old man. And Margaret bloody Thatcher lives! What’s He sodding playing at, eh?”

For 20 years, retrospective fantasies along those lines were applauded every night on the London stage in the musical version of Lee Hall’s play Billy Elliot, set during the strike. Elton John’s song from that show, Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher (“we all celebrate today because it’s one day closer to your death”), was even sung on the night the former prime minister eventually died. “I was on holiday when she snuffed it,” Hall subsequently recalled. “Somehow the producers had tracked me down. They were asking permission to cut the ‘Thatcher’s dead’ song out of ‘respect’. I refused… The cast stopped the show and put it to an audience vote. Only three people voted against playing it and they walked out – the other 1,500 people sang along. Democracy in action.”

The most thoughtful unpicking of all that highly charged history was set out in James Graham’s fabulous 2022 BBC series Sherwood (a drama that prefigured the dystopia of The Way, the three-parter by Graham, Michael Sheen and the documentary-maker Adam Curtis). When Sherwood came out I was sent on a faintly Wigan Pier mission up to the former pit village of Annesley Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, where the drama was set, and where Graham had grown up, to ask ex-miners what they made of it. It remains a sobering experience to walk around those villages where the winding gear of the closed pit has become a heritage attraction; for one thing there is a sense of time having stopped; for another the high street and the faces both betray the marks of that longstanding dereliction.

The primary inspiration for the fiction of Sherwood was the real-life murder of Keith Frogson, former trade unionist, who was killed with a crossbow on the 20th anniversary of the miners’ strike in 2004. The fissures of resentment that tragedy reopened remained raw 20 years on. One afternoon I sat talking to ex-colleagues of Frogson, one after the other, in front rooms that featured mantelpieces full of pit memorabilia, plates and badges and mugs. That evening, I received phone calls from each of those men saying that they wanted to withdraw their co-operation with my article. Their former NUM leader had been in touch, though none of them had worked in a mine for 30 years. The collective feeling was they’d had enough of “London media” coming up to try to understand; no one would step out of line, old habits dying hard.

A survey on Radio Nottingham last week said most people under 30 didn’t even know what the word ‘scab’ meant

Among the people who would speak was David Amos, a NUM official who had kept working during the strike and had subsequently written a PhD dissertation about that history. “Once Scargill came,” Amos told me, “the NUM was quite Orwellian. We said: ‘Are you asking us what to do or are you telling us?’ And they said: ‘We’re telling you.’ Notts miners had a different tradition to that.”

Amos was still ostracised by many of the striking men he had grown up with and worked alongside, though the number was slowly dwindling. “It’s just played out by a few people these days,” he said. “It’s like ageing Jedi Knights battling it out and everyone else is wondering what the bloody hell’s going on. Apparently there was a survey on Radio Nottingham last week that said most people under 30 didn’t even know what the word ‘scab’ meant.”

The final word in Graham’s Sherwood series was given to the widow of the murdered man, who suggested that the division between working people that took root during the strike was exactly what the Thatcher government had always planned. “A former mining town?” she asked a pub full of villagers. “How the hell are we to move on when we talk about ourselves in terms of what we aren’t any more? We’ve had 40 years of this. You get one bloody life and we are spending it hating. Aren’t you all tired? I am. So fucking tired…”

One of the reasons that many mining families can’t move on from the events that brutally ended their imagined future 40 years ago is that, as Scargill predicted and perhaps precipitated, nothing has ever properly replaced that future. Another is that the backstory is endlessly rehearsed as a warmer contrast to the bleak present. Robert Gildea, emeritus professor of modern history at Oxford, last year published an oral history of the strike, Backbone of the Nation, that collected lengthy evidence from 148 interviewees. Many of their stories have long hardened into gospel; Gildea found that in their retelling they inexorably shaped the lives of children and grandchildren born after the strike ended and the pits closed. In some cases the knowledge of this unseen past appeared to prompt addiction and depression; elsewhere Gildea identified a group of miners’ children he came to think of as “redeemers”. “Like the others, they experienced the deprivation and pain of the strike and its defeat, and the devastation of its aftermath. But – exceptionally and consciously – they worked in later life to alleviate the ills suffered by the communities in which they had been brought up” – they became teachers, doctors, social workers, trying to knit the old social fabric back together.

Ken Loach’s film The Old Oak, which came out at the end of last year, looked for similar threads of connection. Now 87, the film-maker said at the time of his film’s release that it would be his last production, and that it was fitting to return to the strike, since that was the event in his lifetime that most determined our precarious “gig economy” present. His film tells the story of TJ, an ex-miner in a run-down Durham town, who tries to integrate a family of Syrian refugees, who have been given a terraced house among the old miners’ back to backs. His old pit colleagues, who have only watched their community fray and decay, instead use the incomers as scapegoats for all their frustrations. TJ runs a pub, the Old Oak, the back room of which, with its miners’ banners and its photographs of the strike, has been locked up for 20 years. It becomes the battleground for another stand-off – between solidarity with destitute foreigners, and a bitter bigotry that stands in place of long-lost community.

Watching that film reminded me of the long ago 2019 election. I was up in Tony Blair’s former constituency of Sedgefield, in Fishburn Working Men’s Club. Downstairs, in the party room, there was a battle-torn miners’ banner in a glass case bearing the face of Keir Hardie; the banner is still brought out each year to head the Durham miners’ parade. A few times, recently, I was told, that room had only been packed out to hear Nigel Farage speak. The walls of the main bar were decorated with paintings of the former Fishburn colliery which once employed nearly every family in the village and, in pride of place, a tableau of the “pits closed by the Tories”, each with its symbolic badge of arms.

Underneath this memorial, on the night after the election, old miners and regulars at the club for 40 and 50 years explained to me, one after the other, how they had voted for Boris Johnson rather than Jeremy Corbyn at that election. “Corbyn doesn’t understand us here,” they insisted. It was a reminder that the battles of 1984 had been well and truly lost. Defending the community had come to seem something more desperate altogether.

Partly for that reason, the miners’ strike remains a storyline that keeps on giving. Over the past week a couple of new books have arrived on my desk. One is a thoughtful and lyrical novel by Andrew McMillan, born in south Yorkshire in 1988, in the shadow of those events. His book, Pity, is structured around the gaps between past and present; haunting memories of tragedy and hardship in generations of mining men and their sons, and academic “field workers” who try and fail to excavate them.

The other is a book of poems by the Doncaster-born and Leeds-based poet Sarah Wimbush. That book, launched at the National Coal Mining Museum, is called simply Strike, and is inspired entirely by images of the conflict, a graphic emotional shorthand that all of us of a certain age know well: helmeted riot policemen in Victorian backstreets, miners’ wives marching under bedsheet banners, teenagers “riddling” bits of coal off slag heaps. The book is prefaced by a poem, Markham Main, about some of the men that the BBC might have mined for stories:

“Afternoons they meet up/ on street corners/ like old youths planning revolution…” Wimbush writes. “After school they take the grand-kids/ to the Pit Top Playground, look forward/ to the night shift at Ikea. Together.”

You are left to wonder a bit about that last word – the thing that was fought for, and perhaps the thing that was lost.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The MP admitted that his words last week had been clumsy, but said in a statement via GB News, where he presents a weekly show, that they were “born out of sheer frustration at what is happening to our beautiful capital city”.

“If you are wrong, apologising is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength,” he said in the statement released on Monday. “But, when you think you are right, you should never apologise because to do so would be a sign of weakness.”

Anderson, who was the Conservative party’s deputy chair until last month, was suspended on Saturday for refusing to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control” of the London mayor.

Rishi Sunak refused to describe Anderson’s comments as Islamophobic when pressed during interviews on a visit to East Yorkshire, continuing to say they were wrong rather than prejudiced.

“I’ve been very clear that what he said was wrong, it was unacceptable, and that’s why we suspended the whip,” the prime minister said. “It’s important that everybody, but particularly elected politicians, are careful with their words and do not inflame tensions.”

Sunak also declined to criticise the former home secretary Suella Braverman, who wrote in a Telegraph article that “the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now”. He said: “I think that those comments were not about an individual in particular.”



As pressure continues to build on Sunak, the Conservative Muslim Forum said it was urgently seeking a meeting with senior government figures this week and was in talks with advisers to set one up.

Naveed Asghar, the deputy chair of the Conservatives’ affiliated body for Muslim members, said: “Is the party racist or Islamophobic? I would say no, from my heart. Individuals? Yes.

“Are these people pandering to the vote base in their seats? I can’t see what’s going on. If he is doubling down on the comments, then the party should absolutely be having a word with him. I was hoping that the suspension would be enough.

“Any inflammatory remarks are just not acceptable, whether it’s people on the left making antisemitic comments or people on the right making anti-Muslim comments.”

Anderson admitted in his statement that some people had found his comments divisive.

“Politics is divisive and I am just incredibly frustrated about the abject failures of the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan,” he said.

In a fresh attack on Khan, the now-independent MP said: “Hundreds of people had been arrested for racist abuse on these marches and we barely hear a peep from the mayor.

“If these marches were about something less fashionable, Sadiq Khan would have been the first to call for them to be cancelled. It’s double standards for political benefit.”

Gavin Barwell, a peer and former chief of staff to Theresa May, said Anderson should not be allowed back in to the parliamentary party until he made a genuine apology.

“In terms of what happens next. I think if you were going to let anyone back in, you’d want to be convinced that an apology was genuine,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear that the language that was used, was used with the intent of stirring up religious hatred and division.”

Downing Street said the government did not tolerate “anti-Muslim hatred in any form”, after Sunak’s spokesperson was challenged over his refusal to refer specifically to Islamophobia while condemning prejudice more generally.

Khan and his Conservative challenger in the London mayoral elections, Susan Hall, presented a united front on Monday when they both called for zero tolerance of racism in the contest.

“We are facing some very difficult times, with the politics of extremism, division and blame becoming more mainstream,” Khan wrote in an article published by the Standard.

Also writing in the Standard, Hall said: “I may be one of Sadiq Khan’s biggest critics, but I also see the monstrous abuse he gets as one of the country’s most prominent Muslim politicians,.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

2d ago 20.21 CET Closing summary Rishi Sunak has claimed extremist groups in the UK are “trying to tear us apart”, in a hastily arranged Downing Street statement hours after George Galloway won a byelection in Rochdale.

The prime minister condemned what he called “a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality” after the 7 October massacre by Hamas and the Israeli invasion of Gaza.

He also claimed democracy itself was a target, as he condemned the election of Galloway, who easily won the seat in Rochdale on a platform that focused on anti-Israel sentiment over Gaza.

In a sometimes rambling and seemingly contradictory 10-minute address, Sunak made points likely to anger MPs on the right of the Conservative party such as Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick, who have sought to frame recent tensions as almost entirely the responsibility of Islamist extremists.

Sunak said the newly-elected MP for Rochdale “dismisses the horror of what happened on 7 October”, “glorifies Hezbollah” and is “endorsed by Nick Griffin, the racist former leader of the BNP”. “I’m not responsible for whoever declares they endorse me … I’ve never met Mr Griffin and have no intention to,” Mr Galloway told Channel 5 News. “I don’t know what the glorifying of Hezbollah is all about but maybe he can tell me on Wednesday at Prime Minister’s Questions if he’s got the guts.” Galloway added that he “abhors extremism just as much as [Sunak]” and “also agreed with him when he said change can only come through the democratic process”.

2d ago 20.01 CET The SNP MP Alison Thewliss has accused the Tory party of stoking up the culture war that has led to the extremism Rishi Sunak says he wants to stamp out.



“The Tories are the architects of the culture war in the UK - and Rishi Sunak has spent his whole time in office promoting it,” she said. “The prime minister has repeatedly, and very deliberately, sought to stoke up divisions, pander to the far-right and pit communities against each other for electoral gain.



“Whether it’s attacking refugees, insulting LGBT people, or failing to call out Lee Anderson’s Islamophobia for what it is - this is an attempt to rewrite history and people in Scotland see through it.



“If the Tory government now wants to bring people together, it must start by changing its own record of divisive language and policies. For people in Scotland, the best way to end these culture wars is to make Scotland Tory-free by voting SNP.” Share

It is an important task of leadership to defend our values and the common bonds that hold us together. “Citizens have a right to go about their business without intimidation and elected representatives should be able to do their jobs and cast their votes without fear or favour.

2d ago 19.22 CET Sunak has been criticised by political opponents recently for failing to tackle “extremism” within his own party. He made no reference to that row as he addressed the broader issue of extremism in the UK. Coming closest to announcing some form of concrete action during his 10-minute speech, Sunak says: If we are asking more of the police, we in government must also back up that call with action. To that end, this month, the government will implement a new, robust framework for how it deals with this issue to ensure that we’re dealing with the root causes of this problem, and that no extremist organisations or individuals are being lent legitimacy by their actions and interactions with central government. You cannot be part of our civic life. If your agenda is to tear it down. We will redouble our support for the Prevent programme to stop young minds being poisoned by extremism. We will demand that universities stop extremist activity on campus. We will also act to prevent people entering this country whose aim is to undermine its values.

2d ago 19.13 CET It’s notable that, when speaking in very general terms, Sunak explicitly calls out both “Islamists” and the “far-right” as extremist threats to the UK – indicating he perhaps wants to calm tensions across the board. But, when he picks out specific examples of behaviour he feels are unacceptable, he focuses solely on pro-Palestine demonstrations. He has said: I respect that the police have a tough job in policing the protests we have seen and that they are operationally independent. But we must draw a line. Yes, you can march and protest with passion. You can demand the protection of civilian life. But no, you cannot call for violent jihad. There is no context in which it can be acceptable to beam antisemitic tropes on to Big Ben in the middle of a vote on Israel, Gaza. And there can be no cause that you can use to justify the support of a proscribed terrorist group like Hamas. And yes, you can freely criticise the actions of this government – or, indeed, any government – that is a fundamental democratic right. But no, you cannot use that as an excuse to call for the eradication of a state or any kind of hatred, or antisemitism.

Yet he has used his speech to talk at length about how immigration has benefited the country. Britain is a patriotic liberal democratic society with a proud past and a bright future. We’re a reasonable country and a decent people. Our story is one of progress of great achievements and enduring values. Immigrants who have come here have integrated and contributed. They have helped write the latest chapter in our island story. They have done this without being required to give up their identity. You can be a practising Hindu and a proud Briton, as I am, or a devout Muslim and a patriotic citizen, as so many are, or a committed Jewish person and the heart of your local community.

Muslim women abused in the street for the actions of a terrorist group they have no connection with. Now, our democracy itself is a target. Council meetings and local events have been stormed. MPs do not feel safe in their homes. Longstanding parliamentary conventions have been upended because of safety concerns.

The Respect party MP for Bradford West – a vocal critic of Israel and its treatment of Palestinian people – had been taking part in the debate at Christ Church college, speaking for the motion that ""Israel should withdraw immediately from the West Bank"", when he learned that Eylon Aslan-Levy, a student opposing it, was Israeli.

Galloway interrupted the third-year philosophy, politics and economics student at Brasenose college when Aslan-Levy used the word ""we"" in reference to Israel.

""You said 'we',"" said Galloway. ""Are you an Israeli?""

""I am, yes,"" Aslan-Levy replied.

""I don't debate with Israelis. I have been misled, sorry,"" Galloway said, standing and putting on his coat, then reiterating as he walked out: ""I don't recognise Israel and I don't debate with Israelis.""

The Oxford student newspaper Cherwell – which has video footage of Galloway's exit – quoted Aslan-Levy as saying afterwards: ""I am appalled that an MP would storm out of a debate with me for no reason other than my heritage. To refuse to talk to someone just because of their nationality is pure racism, and totally unacceptable for a member of parliament.""

The debate organiser, Mahmood Naji, told Cherwell.org: ""At no point during my email exchange with Mr Galloway's secretary was Eylon's nationality ever brought up or mentioned."" He added: ""Nor do I expect to have to tell the speaker what his opponent's nationality is.""

Galloway said on his Facebook page: ""I refused this evening at Oxford University to debate with an Israeli, a supporter of the apartheid state of Israel. The reason is simple: no recognition, no normalisation. Just boycott, divestment and sanctions, until the apartheid state is defeated. I never debate with Israelis nor speak to their media. If they want to speak about Palestine – the address is the PLO.""

The incident prompted a flurry of Twitter exchanges, with many people expressing surprise and anger at Galloway's behaviour.

""George, refusing to debate someone because he's Israeli is absurd,"" wrote Christine Quigley, a former Labour London assembly candidate. ""Would you condone if any other nationality?""

She added: ""As a former constituent of @georgegalloway and pro-Palestinian, I'm deeply unimpressed he refused to debate someone because he was Israeli.""

Another Twitter user, who describes herself as a ""proud mum"" and ""progressive Jew"", asked Galloway: ""Out of interest would you refuse to meet with a constituent if they had Israeli citizenship?""

Galloway reiterated his earlier points in his replies to his questioners, tweeting: ""No recognition of Israel. No normalisation. Christ Church never informed us the debate would be with an Israeli. Simple.""

The MP has long been a staunch supporter of the Palestinians and trenchant critic of Israel, speaking of his hatred for the ""Zionist state"" and calling for its dismantling.

Aslan-Levy told the Guardian he had in fact been calling for a solution that would recognise both states.

""As opposition speaker, my case was not that Israel should remain in the West Bank, but that such a withdrawal should not be immediate – ie unilateral – but in the context of a negotiated peace treaty, which would recognise both Israeli and Palestinian states.""

The student moderating the debate also expressed his disappointment at Galloway's actions, and urged him to think again.

Michael Baldwin, a third-year student at New College, noted that Galloway had once been given an honorary Palestinian passport, and said the MP would be ""rightly indignant"" if someone refused to debate him because of it. He added: ""I would encourage Mr Galloway to reconsider his position, which is open to accusations of xenophobia.""

A spokesman for the Palestinian boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign moved to distance itself from Galloway's actions, saying the movement rejected ""all forms of racism, including Islamophobia and anti-Semitism"".

He added: ""BDS does not call for a boycott of individuals because she or he happens to be Israeli or because they express certain views. Of course, any individual is free to decide who they do and do not engage with.""","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Speaking before next week’s budget, Reeves said the party that wins the next election would have the worst inheritance of any incoming government since the war and that a national mission was needed to kickstart the economy.

“I recognise the dire inheritance we would have if we win the election. I am not going to be able to turn everything round overnight. We are going to have to grow the economy. There will be a relentless focus on what we need to grow the economy,” the shadow chancellor said.

Referring to a soundbite used by George Osborne before the Conservatives came to power in 2010, Reeves said: “George Osborne promised to fix the nation’s roof. But the Conservatives have broken the windows, kicked the door in and now they’re burning the house down.”

Jeremy Hunt is putting the finishing touches to next Wednesday’s budget, with the Treasury massaging down expectations of the size of an anticipated tax giveaway in light of deteriorating forecasts for the public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which will give its final, confidential pre-budget assessment to the Treasury on Friday.

“I am not going pre-empt what the chancellor does or the forecasts published by the OBR,” Reeves said. “However, we do know that the budget will paint a picture of 14 years of economic failure. The next government – Conservative or Labour – will inherit the worst set of economic circumstances since the second world war.”

Sketching out Labour’s critique of the government’s economic record since 2010, Reeves said public debt as a share of national output was at the highest level since the 1960s; debt interest payments were at the highest level since the second world war; taxes as a share of national output were the highest since 1949; the economy was smaller than when Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022; and the current parliament was on track to be the first in which living standards – as measured by real household disposable incomes – fell.

“There needs to be a national mission to kickstart our economy”, she said. “Instead, we’re having a debate in the Conservative party about headroom and what’s best for Rishi Sunak’s leadership.”

Hunt will use next week’s speech to say the worst is over for the economy and that it is already recovering from the mild recession that it slipped into in the second half of 2023. But the chancellor’s room for manoeuvre is limited by official forecasts showing he will meet one of his fiscal rules – to have national debt falling in five years’ time – by the narrowest of margins.

Reeves has been reluctant to say whether Labour would support any tax cuts Hunt might announce next week, preferring to wait until the OBR publishes its judgment on the the impact of Hunt’s measures after the budget.

She rejected accusations that Labour’s plan for the economy differed little from that of the Conservatives. “People will see a real change in our economy under Labour. People will see something they haven’t seen for a long time: an economy that’s growing and creating prosperity,” she said.

Reeves said Labour’s growth plan was built on three pillars: stability, investment and reform.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Two former advisers to the Treasury, backed by other economists, said that instead of decisions aimed at “sabotaging prospects for the next government”, the chancellor should focus on the long-term national interest with measures to spur investment and growth.

In a statement to the Observer, Dimitri Zenghelis, a former head of economic forecasting at the Treasury, and Anna Valero, a former member of the chancellor’s economic advisory council, said the country needed to break out of a cycle of short-termism.

“Tax cuts to stimulate a pre-­election consumer spending spree is the last thing the British economy needs and will cost us all dear,” they said.

“For over a decade, economic short-termism and low and volatile investment has saddled the country with macroeconomic instability, stagnant living standards and one of the poorest productivity performances among major economies.”

Warning against using the budget for political reasons and to satisfy demands from Tory MPs to slash spending and cut tax, they added: “Instead of sabotaging prospects for the next government, the chancellor should announce a package of measures to drive UK innovation and competitiveness, spur productivity and unlock new, intelligent and sustainable forms of growth.”

On Saturday there were signs of tension between No 10 and the Treasury over tax and spend decisions, with Rishi Sunak said to be pushing harder for tax reductions.

Government sources said a move to reduce a planned rise in public spending for 2025 from 0.9% of GDP to 0.75% (which would raise £5bn) was “still live”, as was the ­prospect of more tax cuts. A further reduction in national insurance, in addition to the 2% announced last autumn, or in the basic rate of income tax have both been under consideration. Another option being considered is scaling back the benefits “non-doms” receive from the tax system.

Such a move – which the Tory government has previously claimed would drive wealth out of the country – would be seen as nakedly political because Labour has promised to use the £2bn it would raise from scrapping non-dom tax status to fund its flagship policy of breakfast clubs in all state primary schools, as well as more dental appointments.

Labour sources have indicated that if the government does scale back tax breaks for non-doms, Keir Starmer’s party may not be able to fulfil its policy commitments should it come to power.

Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility informed the Treasury that the amount of “fiscal headroom” it has – around £13bn to fund any giveaways – had fallen over recent days due to the state of the national finances, lessening Hunt’s room for manoeuvre.

Of that £13bn, around £5bn is expected to be accounted for by freezing fuel duty again while a further 1% cut in national insurance would cost another £4.5bn.

Ben Zaranko, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the chancellor was “sailing very close to the wind” if he was to meet his rule of having debt falling as a proportion of GDP within five years.

“If the government was serious about getting debt falling, it would aim to meet this target with a greater degree of ‘headroom’ rather than seek to spend every last penny,” he said.

“The chancellor faces a clear temptation to ‘pay for’ immediate tax cuts with unspecified post-election cuts to public services, thereby leaving the difficult business of allocating those spending cuts to the next government. He should resist that temptation. If he wants to cut taxes, he should spell out where the spending cuts will fall.”

David Gauke, a former Tory Treasury minister, said: “If they are going to bet the house on lower taxes, that will make them look less fiscally credible. That is a political risk as well as being an economic risk.

“They may think they are just passing on problems to a future government but it will also damage the Conservatives’ wider economic reputation if they go down that route.”

Gauke added that Hunt’s reputation was at stake. “This is probably his last big job and his last budget. If I was Jeremy Hunt my priority would be ensuring that my reputation and the Conservatives’ reputation for good economic management is enhanced not diminished, rather than trying to gamble that a big tax cut would be transformational, which I don’t think it would be. It certainly wasn’t last autumn.”

On Saturday as budget talks continued between No 10 and 11 Downing Street, the Treasury announced £800m of investment by 2029 in a series of measures across the police, NHS and justice system to improve productivity in the public sector.

To help get police officers back to frontline tasks, over £230m will fund the rollout of time-saving technology including automated redaction of personal information such as name badges in shoplifting incidents, irrelevant faces from body-worn cameras and number plates from video evidence.

Hunt said: “We shouldn’t fall into the trap of thinking more spending buys us better public services. There is too much waste in the system and we want public servants to get back to doing what matters most: teaching our children, keeping us safe and treating us when we’re sick.”

Zenghelis, now at Cambridge University, and Valero, from the London School of Economics, blamed what they described as Hunt’s “arbitrary debt rules” for “stunting UK growth”. They said that higher borrowing would be more than justified so long as the money was spent on vital infrastructure that would boost growth.

Hunt is expected to tell parliament on Wednesday that he has constructed a budget that will bring down the ratio of debt to annual national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), in the final year of his five-year forecast.

Under the terms of the rule, the debt to GDP ratio is allowed to rise for four years, as long as it falls in the fifth year of projections for the economy and the public finances provided by the Office for Budget Responsibility – the Treasury’s independent forecasting unit.

UK GDP is about £2.1tn and the cumulative debt position is about the same, leaving a debt to GDP ratio of about 96%.

Zenghelis and Valero said: “The time has come to reform the fiscal rules and banish the myth of fiscal headroom. Debt is not a burden if it finances resilient, sustainable and productive investment.

“The stop-start nature of the UK’s investment means there are significant underspends from year to year and lots of money is wasted. This is a contributing factor to falling living standards.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Lee Anderson, the MP for Ashfield, lost the Conservative party whip on Saturday after refusing to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control of” Sadiq Khan. Anderson claimed on GB News that the London mayor had “given our capital city away to his mates”.

The remarks have led to calls for the prime minister to explicitly denounce anti-Muslim bigotry and act to tackle it internally.

Sayeeda Warsi, the Tory peer who was a cabinet minister in David Cameron’s government, said Sunak needed to “find the language” to “call Islamophobia Islamophobia”.

“What is it about the prime minister that he can’t even call out anti-Muslim racism and anti-Muslim bigotry? Why can’t he just use those words?” she told the Guardian.

Asked whether Sunak should explicitly condemn Anderson’s comments as Islamophobia, Warsi said: “Of course he should. If you can’t call racism racism, if you can’t call antisemitism antisemitism, and if you can’t call Islamophobia Islamophobia, then how are we going to fix it?”

In a statement on Sunday, Sunak decried “the explosion in prejudice and antisemitism since the Hamas terrorist attacks on 7 October” in Israel. He did not explicitly refer to Islamophobia. Khan criticised the prime minister on social media for failing “to mention anti-Muslim hatred at all”.

Speaking to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg show on Sunday, the deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden said he did not agree with Anderson’s comments but added: “I don’t believe that Lee Anderson said those remarks intending to be Islamophobic.”

A Conservative party source defended the comments on Friday night, but Anderson was suspended from the party whip on Saturday after refusing to apologise for them.

Paul Scully, the former Tory minister for London, said: “We went through all this about Sadiq Khan and his ‘friends’ and all that kind of stuff when Zac Goldsmith was fighting Sadiq [for the mayoralty] the first time. It didn’t work then and it’s not going to work now … It’s just not appropriate.”

Ministers also faced questions over why no action had been taken against Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, who wrote an article for the Telegraph saying: “The truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now.”

One Tory MP said: “What I can’t work out is why Suella hasn’t had the whip removed. She said it first.”

Another claimed: “Suella’s language has been irresponsible and inflammatory for years. She thinks she needs to reflect what she thinks is public opinion. Actually the British public are far more generous in spirit than she is … She is running in front of herds, polarising opinion and providing the conditions for extremism on all sides to grow. Anderson is an idiot. She [Braverman] is causing harm.”

Warsi said: “There will always be people who hide behind the word Zionist, people with a long history of antisemitism who use the term Zionist when they actually mean Jews. It’s a very disingenuous form of antisemitism. And there are always people with a long history of anti-Muslim racism who will hide behind the word Islamist when they actually mean Muslims.”

Former justice secretary Robert Buckland, the Tory MP for South Swindon, launched a broadside against Anderson, Braverman and Liz Truss and said that any Conservative politician intent on stoking division “had better get out and join another party”.

There was also criticism of the party’s inaction against Truss, the former prime minister, who last week took part in an interview with Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist to Donald Trump. She remained silent as Bannon hailed the far-right figure Tommy Robinson as a “hero”.

Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, wrote to Sunak on Sunday urging him to suspend Truss from the party. “If you do not take action you will be allowing the divisive, deluded and dangerous views of the far-right into mainstream British politics,” he said.

The Conservative party is divided over Anderson’s future and whether his controversial style of politics helps the party reach socially conservative voters. Some Tory cabinet ministers suggested on Sunday that the door was open for Anderson to return later down the line.

Asked about his comments, David TC Davies, the secretary of state for Wales, told BBC Radio Wales: “Lee has made a good contribution to the Conservative party over the years and I hope this issue is going to get sorted out.” He later added that Anderson “has got a good contribution to make and I hope he might return”.

Meanwhile Dowden said: “We gave him the opportunity to apologise. Of course, if he apologises, we’d look at the nature of that and make a determination at that point. But that’s a matter for the chief whip.”

Any attempt to readmit Anderson would be resisted by centrist Conservative MPs, who think his incendiary comments repel moderate voters. One senior Tory said: “I think it will be very difficult for the party to readmit Lee given the hard time we have given Labour on racism and discrimination. No 10 did the right thing by acting swiftly and decisively. We have to be clear what we stand for – we either stand up to racism in all its forms or we don’t.”

The Muslim Council of Britain, Britain’s largest Muslim body, said the Conservative party should launch an investigation into alleged “structural Islamophobia” within its ranks.

In a letter to Tory chairman Richard Holden, MCB secretary general Zara Mohammed said: “Our view is that the Islamophobia in the party is institutional, tolerated by the leadership and seen as acceptable by great swathes of the party membership.”

The row comes after Labour faced its own crisis over antisemitism. The party stood by its Rochdale byelection candidate, Azhar Ali, after he was recorded claiming Israel had allowed the 7 October attacks as a pretext to invade Gaza, saying he had immediately apologised. The party withdrew its support when it emerged that Ali also blamed “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” for the suspension of another Labour MP.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

In one room, boxes of leaflets are piled high against second-hand cars. In another, he takes his campaign to the airwaves.

Earlier this week when MPs raised fears for their safety amid the increasingly fraught votes on Gaza, Galloway told thousands of supporters online that the names of Keir Starmer’s team were “dripping in blood”.

From the Suzuki boardroom where, according to activists, he broadcasts his twice-weekly online polemics, he said Labour’s motion had been proposed by “the Labour fiends of Israel, not friends” and “the worst scoundrels and criminals in the international community at this time”.

With less than a week to go until the vote described as “the most radioactive byelection in living memory”, Galloway, the veteran agitator, is the bookies’ favourite to win.

“I stand on the brink of an historic byelection victory which will shake the walls of Westminster, which will change history,” he bellowed with characteristic understatement this week.

Galloway, 69, has twice unseated Labour, his former party, in similarly ugly elections, and plans to ride another wave of anger from Rochdale to the Commons on 29 February.

The former Press TV host refused to talk to the Guardian at his election HQ this week, but the mood among his activists was upbeat. About 30% of Rochdale’s population is Muslim – around 30,000 people – and they feel they have enough support to overturn Labour’s 9,668-vote majority.

In some parts of Rochdale, every house has a Galloway poster in the window. WhatsApp groups are abuzz. His leaflets, in the colours of the Palestinian flag, mention “potholes”, “town centre” and “grooming gangs”, but online the maverick politician is clear that the poll is about one issue: “a referendum on Gaza”.

Going into the final weekend of campaigning, the mood among Labour figures was dark. The party in effect left the playing field after it emerged that its candidate, Azhar Ali, had been recorded sharing inflammatory conspiracy theories about Israeli involvement in the 7 October atrocity.

Labour was already haemorrhaging support from the town’s Muslim community before the scandal, amid unease about the party’s stance on a ceasefire and Starmer’s suggestion in an LBC interview that Israel had the “right” to cut off Gaza’s water, a comment he later clarified.

One senior party figure said Labour had planned to “counter Galloway’s megaphone with a whisper campaign”, soothing community concerns in quiet conversations in homes, mosques and community centres. But that plan was killed when Ali, who had been tasked with bringing people back to the party, was suspended.

The only hope now is that there is enough residual support for Labour to survive, but there is little optimism. “If we could cling on to half that vote I think we’d have survived,” said one local Labour source on Friday. “I’m not so sure we will now.”

Galloway is the bookies’ favourite. His team has about 200 volunteers – including a core of 50 – who plan to make contact with each of Rochdale’s 79,000 voters three times before polling day.

One of the volunteers, Farrukh Haroon, 48, the brother of the former Respect party leader Salma Yaqoob, said they had activists at the school gates – some handing out stickers in the colours of the Palestine flag – and others spreading the word on social media. “There will be a massive, massive push this weekend,” he said, stuffing leaflets though letterboxes.

It is online where Labour fears Galloway is having the most impact. Harrowing images emerge daily out of Gaza and are shared widely on the WhatsApp groups of younger Muslims in Rochdale, many who do not have their parents’ loyalty to Labour.

In Rochdale town centre, there was little enthusiasm for any of the 11 male candidates. Ann Beresford, 70, said she had always voted Labour but was dismayed by Ali’s remarks and the party’s handling of it. “If he’s making comments like that he should keep it to himself,” she said. Her daughter Sarah Taafe, 47, said she also normally voted Labour but had decided not to cast a vote next week with a general election due some time in the next year.

In the San Remo cafe, another former Labour MP has returned to haunt the party. Simon Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale from 2010 to 2017, was suspended by the party in 2015 over explicit messages he sent to a 17-year-old girl. Now he is back and standing for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party presided over by Nigel Farage.

Tucking into a small caesar salad – his wife, a 29-year-old beauty therapist from Rwanda, has banned him from eating carbohydrates before polling day – Danczuk, 57, said he believed Galloway would not be Rochdale’s next MP as there was a “silent majority who are determined not to have him”.

Whatever the result, there is little sign that Rochdale will be able to unite behind the winner. The loser, said one businesswoman, would be Rochdale: “It’s a total, total disaster. Everything you hear about Rochdale is negative and it’s not a negative place at all. Most people are saying: isn’t it chaotic. End of story.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

David Willetts, who leads the Intergenerational Centre thinktank, called for the next government to implement a major new policy to spread wealth in Britain.

It comes as research showed parents whose assets have been boosted by soaring property prices and final salary pensions are poised to bequeath millennial children about £150,000 each on average.

While annual inheritance transfers are forecast to rise by a third to £145bn by 2033, one in 10 millennials are still set to get nothing. By contrast, the top 10% will get more than £500,000 each and many much more, analysis for the Guardian by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found.

A separate analysis, by the estate agent Knight Frank, this week claimed that over the next two decades, $90tn of assets – mostly driven by rising house prices – will move between the silent generation and baby boomer and millennials in the US alone. This would make affluent millennials “the richest generation in history”.

The suggestion millennials were about to become rich was met by bemusement from many in the generation born between 1980 and 1994 who, while being derided by some for profligate spending on gourmet coffee and avocado on toast, have lived through slow wage growth, rising rents and the evaporation of dreams of home ownership.

The huge sums being inherited by a new generation could, nevertheless, result in a shift in the way money is invested, with research showing millennials are happier to hold cryptocurrency and assets that can show societal and environmental benefits.

Millennials are certainly set to benefit from having fewer siblings with whom to share windfalls than their parents – 1.8 compared with 2.5 for people born in the 60s. But most should not get excited about retiring early. The IFS said the typical age at which they will inherit is 64 – an age at which the Beatlessaid was apt for renting a cottage in the Isle of Wight and sitting grandchildren on your knee.

“It doesn’t matter if you are Conservative or Labour, a world in which inheritance matters more and earnings matter less is a less open and socially mobile society,” Willetts said. “[Inheritances are now] coming to people quite late in life. It will reinforce a pattern of inheritance where the grandkids will benefit. We are going to have some very rich inheritors and a growing number of people who never get on the housing ladder and rent until old age.”

Without reform, a key consequence of the way inheritances will be transferred is set to be widening inequality. Inheritances will only nudge up lifetime incomes by 5% for millennials from the poorest fifth of families while those from the richest fifth will enjoy a 29% wealth bump, the IFS said. That will probably mean the inheritance surge will also deepen wealth differences between people in the north and south, where property values have grown at vastly different rates.

For example, millennial friends who studied together at university and enjoyed similar economic circumstances through the bulk of their careers could see their fortunes diverge markedly when they inherit, placing tensions on social bonds. If their parent owned a home in London, they would have made £254,000 on average in house price growth over the past 15 years. But if their parent owned a home in the east of England or the north-west, that windfall would have been at least three times smaller.

Inheritance flows will probably exacerbate inequalities between white people and those from black African, black Caribbean, Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds who are already half to a third as likely to receive lifetime gifts from their parents, possibly owing to them being less wealthy.

Willetts said too little had been done to spread wealth since the council house right to buy scheme and the privatisation of utilities such as British Telecom in the 1980s. He revived the idea of the citizens inheritance after first proposing it six years ago.

A similar idea has also been proposed by the IPPR thinktank, which is seen as increasingly influential on the Labour party.

Willetts said it could be paid for by lowering the threshold at which inheritance tax is paid – effectively £1m in many cases – abolishing exemptions while also reducing the current 40% tax rate.

The amount of money gathering in inheritable assets has been growing rapidly in recent years. David Sturrock, senior research economist at the IFS, said the average household led by people in their 70s holds 20% more wealth than the same group a decade ago.

“Working incomes are growing more slowly so the amounts [in inheritances] are a much more consequential part of your lifetime resources,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Anderson, who was a deputy Tory chair until last month, was suspended from the party whip on Saturday after he refused to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control of” Sadiq Khan. Anderson claimed on GB News that the London mayor had “given our capital city away to his mates”. He now sits as the independent MP for Ashfield.

Several Conservative MPs said on Monday they would like to see Anderson readmitted to their ranks if he apologised for his remarks. Jonathan Gullis, the Tory MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, told Times Radio: “I hope that we will see him return to that party sooner rather than later but of course he has to, I think, make that apology to Mayor Khan.”

Another Tory MP said: “He wants to come back. We want him back.”

The leaked CDO WhatsApp messages show the fury with which Anderson’s suspension was met by grassroots Tories, several of whom said they agreed with his comments.

The CDO was created in December 2022 by the Tory donor and Johnson supporter Peter Cruddas and contains members of the party and non-members. It has had high-profile support from senior Tory politicians on the right, with Priti Patel, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries addressing its conference last May.

After news of Anderson’s suspension broke, one activist on a CDO WhatsApp group for the south-east said it was “time for the snake of a PM to go.” Another called Sunak a “nutsak” and said “he should never have been there”.

Several group members endorsed Anderson’s comments and expressed similar sentiments. “And everyone says Suella was exaggerating,” one activist said. “The government are now owned by fear of Islamic rule.” Another responded: “So right.”

Another group member denounced Sunak as “weak and feeble” and said: “At an association AGM today, we were all asked to get behind Rishi Sunak. But I see now he’s fallen for a Labour attack on Lee Anderson which is a diversion of Keir Starmer’s ‘urging’/coercion of the speaker of the house last Wednesday.”

Multiple activists expressed support for Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, who wrote last week that “the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now”.

One CDO member said: “She is saying the exact same thing as Lee Anderson, just in less colourful language, and importantly in print. I am beginning to believe that Suella is the only person who has shown the mettle who can turn the party and remove the threat of Islam from our country.”

In a screenshot seen by the Guardian, this message was liked by 10 group members.

In an echo of a speech that Braverman made in the US in September, James Cleverly, the home secretary, will on Tuesday call for global action to reform international laws governing migration.

He plans to stress that people from developing countries seeking to move to the west should be encouraged to “stay and thrive at home”, comments which have been condemned by a refugee charity for failing to refer to the refugee convention and the right to claim asylum.

Members of the WhatsApp group shared a petition calling for Anderson’s reinstatement, with one person saying it had amassed 5,000 signatures overnight. Claire Bullivant of the Conservative Post, which launched the petition, said on Tuesday that it had surpassed 15,000 signatures.

The messages demonstrate the activists’ degree of pessimism about their electoral chances in the general election. Several said Anderson’s suspension would repel voters who agreed with his views.

“There goes Lee’s voters – wonder what happens when it dawns on them that they actually need voters to keep themselves in power,” one person said. Another remarked: “5 years of labour [sic] will concentrate minds, it’s the only way they will wake up unfortunately.”

One group member shared a link to a “Lee Anderson Appreciation Group” on Facebook alongside the words: “In times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act,” attributing them to George Orwell.

In another WhatsApp group, for CDO members in London, there was speculation over whether Sunak might remove the Tory whip from Truss. David Campbell Bannerman, the former Tory MEP, told the group: “Truss mentioned – left pushing on it.”

On Monday Anderson stood by his remarks, admitting they were “clumsy” but insisting they were “born out of sheer frustration at what is happening to our beautiful capital city”.

He said in a statement: “If you are wrong, apologising is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength. But when you think you are right, you should never apologise because to do so would be a sign of weakness.”

Rishi Sunak repeatedly refused to describe Anderson’s comments as Islamophobic when pressed during interviews on Monday.

“I’ve been very clear that what he said was wrong, it was unacceptable and that’s why we suspended the whip,” the prime minister told broadcasters in Yorkshire. “It’s important that everybody, but particularly elected politicians, are careful with their words and do not inflame tensions.”

Sunak also declined to criticise Braverman, saying her comments “were not about an individual in particular”.

In an article for the Evening Standard on Monday, Khan wrote that Sunak’s refusal to describe the comments as Islamophobic was “a tacit endorsement of anti-Muslim hatred and can only lead to the conclusion that anti-Muslim bigotry and racism are not taken seriously”.

As pressure mounted on Sunak, the Conservative Muslim Forum, which is the party’s affiliated body for Muslim members, was in talks about meeting the Tory chair, Richard Holden, this week.

Naveed Asghar, the deputy chair of the CMF, said: “Is the party racist or Islamophobic? I would say no, from my heart. Individuals? Yes. Are these people pandering to the vote base in their seats? I can’t see what’s going on.

“If he is doubling down on the comments then the party should absolutely be having a word with him. I was hoping that the suspension would be enough.

“Any inflammatory remarks are just not acceptable, whether it’s people on the left making antisemitic comments or people on the right making anti-Muslim comments.”

Gavin Barwell, a peer and former chief of staff to Theresa May, said Anderson should not be allowed back into the parliamentary party until he made a genuine apology.

“In terms of what happens next, I think if you were going to let anyone back in, you’d want to be convinced that an apology was genuine,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear that the language that was used, was used with the intent of stirring up religious hatred and division.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

In a blunt response to Sunak’s unusual intervention, the London mayor said the prime minister had still not fully addressed the nature of the remarks made by former Tory vice-chair Lee Anderson, who said Islamists had “got control” of Khan and London. Khan, one of the most powerful Muslims in public life, warned that the past few weeks had seen “a concerted and growing attempt by some to degrade and humiliate minorities for political and electoral gain”.

This follows another fractious week, in which George Galloway won the Rochdale byelection after a bitter contest. Following the result, the prime minister made an impromptu speech on Friday night stating that democracy was under attack and criticising voters for backing Galloway – whose pitch was focused on Gaza and heavy criticism of Israel.

However, Khan said Sunak and his team had still not fully addressed the remarks made by Anderson last month. While the Ashfield MP was suspended from the Tory party, ministers have refused to say the remarks amounted to Islamophobia. “We are a week on from the racist, anti-Muslim and Islamophobic remarks made by a senior Tory MP,” Khan told a London Labour conference last night. “The prime minister has failed to condemn them for what they are – even as he stood outside No 10 and spoke out against extremism – and neither has anybody around him.

“What we are witnessing is a concerted and growing attempt by some to degrade and humiliate minorities for political and electoral gain. We have been here before – in 2016, when the Tories waged a disgraceful campaign against me, against us. We cannot let them try it again.. As the poison of antisemitism and Islamophobia continues to infect our politics, now more than ever, we need to display our best values rather than our worst fears.”

The Conservatives received further criticism after reports that Anderson, who has refused to apologise for his comments about Khan, appeared with former prime minister Liz Truss at a party fundraiser in Nottinghamshire on Friday. Many Tory MPs suspect Anderson is planning to defect to Reform UK, the successor to the Brexit party.

Jonathan Ashworth, shadow paymaster general, said it “beggars belief” that Anderson continues to attend Tory party events. “Given that Rishi Sunak deems Mr Anderson unfit to be a Tory MP, he now needs to bar him from fundraising for the Tory party,” he said. “Unless he takes action, Rishi Sunak will again be exposed as weaker than ever, and out of control of his chaotic, divided party.”

It may be that they don’t have the votes to win seats, but as we always see, when it comes to it, people panic Labour MP

Meanwhile, Galloway’s victory in Rochdale has caused nervousness among many Labour MPs. Some are already under local pressure to strengthen their criticism of Israel. While many see Galloway as a unique character with a track record of by-election victories, some believe a coalition of Muslim and leftwing voters concerned about Labour’s stance on Gaza could cost the party seats.

A slate of independent candidates to run against those Labour MPs who failed to back a Gaza ceasefire in a vote last year is being drawn up, with the first tranche of names set to be announced soon.

While few of those who stand will have a chance of winning a seat, some Labour MPs are concerned that Keir Starmer’s team are underestimating the threat posed by such candidates, because they could take Labour votes and let in the Tories in tight contests. There are also concerns about their impact on party management. “It may be that they don’t have the votes to win seats, but ... when it comes to it, people panic,” said one Labour MP.

The row comes as Khan is warning that his chances of claiming another term as London mayor have been exaggerated by polls suggesting he has a significant lead over Susan Hall, the Tory candidate. His team believes the impact of the switch to a first-past-the-post system, as well as changes to voter ID that they believe will suppress the Labour vote, will effectively erase the 5% winning margin Khan enjoyed at his last election.

He said last night that he was in what he believed was the toughest contest of his political life. “With no second preferences, the choice is between me and the most divisive, hard-right candidate the Tories have ever put up in London,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

“Our families have voted for Labour for many years because they’ve got used to ticking the flower box, but this is a vote for change,” said Ali, a community worker.

Around him, several men in their 20s said they had voted for the first time on Thursday in order to send Galloway to parliament – and deliver a message to Labour.

“Labour have been running these streets for years and they’ve done nothing,” Ali said. “Starmer has betrayed the people of Rochdale and the Asian vote.”

Galloway, the irrepressible agitator, is back in the Commons representing a fourth constituency in nearly four decades after urging voters to deliver “the ultimate protest” over Labour’s handling of the Israel-Gaza conflict.

The scale of his victory, winning a near-6,000 vote majority, was the final surprise in a byelection beset by chaos, controversy and allegations of dirty tricks.

Police officers guarded polling stations in parts of the Greater Manchester town in a way not seen in a British election in decades, while security was tight at the overnight count.

Two days earlier a man was arrested for sending a death threat to Rochdale’s former Labour MP, Simon Danczuk, who was contesting the seat for the anti-immigration Reform UK, which hired security guards and moved some of its staff out of a shared property over fears for their safety.

Nigel Farage’s party, which came sixth with a dismal 6% of the vote, lodged a formal complaint about Galloway’s team distributing leaflets outside polling venues on Thursday.

The complaint to Rochdale’s returning officer, which has been seen by the Guardian, accuses Galloway’s activists of “breaking the rules with impunity” – an accusation they would deny.

Galloway’s team, meanwhile, claimed Labour had tried to solicit votes inside a polling station and said its banners had been torn down all over Rochdale.

Observers will seek to draw wider lessons from Galloway’s striking victory, yet this was a contest virtually unprecedented in modern times. Labour, who had held the seat with a near-10,000 vote majority, abandoned its campaign after it emerged that its candidate had shared inflammatory conspiracy theories about Israel.

But Labour would be wrong to dismiss the result as an aberration. “I think this is a historic shift away from Labour,” said Wafa Hameed Salik, 43, before prayers outside Rochdale’s Bilal mosque on Friday.

00:00:32 'I apologise to voters in Rochdale,' Starmer says after Galloway wins byelection – video

The Labour party runs through Salik’s blood: his dad was a respected party figure locally – a road was named after him – and his uncle was until recently the Labour mayor of Rochdale. But he voted for Galloway having lost hope in Starmer’s party.

“Labour always thought ‘oh, we have our voters and whatever’ but this is changing,” he said. Galloway’s campaign, he said, was “like an explosion”.

The 69-year-old ex-Labour MP, unseating his former party for the third time in another campaign fought largely on the Middle East, used a speech outside the Bilal mosque to ask Muslims how they would answer “on judgment day” when they were asked: “What did you do when Keir Starmer asked you to endorse what he has done?”

Seen by some as cynical, divisive and manipulative, Galloway doubled down, describing the byelection in one of Britain’s poorest towns as “a referendum on Gaza”.

Outside Rochdale’s mainly-Muslim areas, he sought to show he cared about local issues, delivering leaflets mentioning potholes and Primark – he promised to bring the shop to the town’s shopping centre – written on literature in the colours of the Palestinian flag.

Khalid Javed, 64, who voted for Galloway in this election, said voters like him in Rochdale wanted to express their lack of trust in the political system. “We wanted to mess everything up,” he said. “We want to show that there’s no support for the major parties. We don’t want to listen, I despise these people. They don’t represent us.”

This dissatisfaction with the main parties is not exclusive to the Muslim community, however.

David Tully, a local businessman and a political newcomer, finished second in the byelection with an extraordinary 21% of the vote. This meant three-fifths of the votes went to the insurgents, Galloway and Tully, more than double the number shared between the three main parties, although Labour’s campaign was cut short.

How this byelection result is reflected at the general election may be largely down to Labour. If the party can mend relations with the Muslim voters who flocked en masse to Galloway, then they will probably retake Rochdale within months. If not, the party could be out in the cold in the town for years.

Back outside Bilal mosque, another worshipper – who did not want to give his full name – said he liked and respected Galloway but did not vote for him because the MP’s speeches, however powerful, were “not going to make a difference”.

“What is he really gonna do? The whole world can’t do anything [to stop the conflict],” Mr Arfan, 34, said.

I have contacted ITV to urge it to rebroadcast the docudrama Breathtaking (TV review, 19 February) during the upcoming general election campaign. This devastating reminder should be at the forefront of minds when voting. We must never forget what they all did – the good, the bad and the corrupt.

Susan Hall was also challenged in a letter from the Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, to commit to not using “any further Islamophobia or anti-Muslim hatred” as part of her election campaign in London.

The intervention comes as the Conservatives come under mounting pressure over comments by the party’s former deputy chair, Lee Anderson, who had the party whip suspended on Saturday after he refused to apologise for saying Islamists had “got control” of Khan.

Past comments and actions attributed to Hall, whose candidacy has been dogged by controversy over stances such as her support for Donald Trump, were listed in Dodds’s letter. They include:

Claiming that Jewish Londoners are “frightened” of Khan, which Labour described as a “divisive and Islamophobic dog-whistle”.

Endorsing a tweet from a far-right figure calling Khan the ”mayor of Londonistan”, a known Islamophobic trope.

Liking a reply to a tweet about Khan’s strategy to tackle violence against women and girls that said: “Well said Susan, that Labour Traitor RAT Likes that sort of thing”, in an apparent reference to female genital mutilation.

Labour drew on material highlighted by the campaign group Hope Not Hate as part of an investigation into Hall.

“Until you have provided an apology and much-needed clarity on your past statements – and until you have issued a full and unqualified condemnation of Lee Anderson’s comments as ‘racist’ and ‘Islamophobic’ – Londoners will be entitled to question your commitment to defeating not only anti-Muslim hatred, but all other forms of bigotry and racism,” Dodds wrote.

Hall used an article published by the Standard on Monday to condemn “the monstrous abuse” Khan has faced, but Dodds said she had not gone far enough.

In Hall’s Standard article, which was headlined “We Conservatives must criticise Sadiq Khan for his policies and politics, but never for his Muslim faith,” she did not mention Anderson by name.

She wrote: “I may be one of Mayor Sadiq Khan’s biggest critics, but I also see the monstrous abuse he gets as one of the country’s most prominent Muslim politicians. No one should have to put up with that, and I wholly condemn anyone who does it, or fuels it. His faith is one of his positive characteristics, not something to be suspicious of.”

A spokesperson for Hall said the Conservatives had “already responded” and pointed to the Standard article.

Hall, a London assembly member, was the Conservatives’ surprise choice last year to take on Khan in this year’s mayoral election, in part because of her low profile, but also her hard-right views and strong support for Trump and Liz Truss.

In its investigation into Hall last year, Hope Not Hate found that she had liked tweets praising Enoch Powell, as well as some containing Islamophobic abuse towards Khan.

In February 2020, Hall liked a message on Twitter, now known as X, praising Powell, a former Conservative minister whose name became a byword for racism in UK politics after his notorious “rivers of blood” speech in 1968, which warned about immigration to the UK.

The tweet depicted Powell with the words: “It’s never too late to get London back,” an apparent reference to the city’s multiculturalism.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The former prime minister was criticised over the weekend when she told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland she had been thwarted during her 45-day term in office by a small cabal within Whitehall.

It has now emerged that the roundtable event was also attended by a number of well-known figures from the fringes of global conservatism. They included Tommy Tuberville, a US senator who once refused to say white nationalists were racist, Hiroaki “Jay” Aeba, a representative of a conservative Japanese cult, and two allies of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán.

The revelations have intensified calls for the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to remove the Tory whip from Truss, who is already under fire for not criticising Steve Bannon during a separate CPAC event during which the former Trump adviser called the far-right figure Tommy Robinson (whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) a “hero”.

Jonathan Ashworth, a shadow CabinetOffice minister, said: “It is anyone’s guess what Liz Truss thinks she is up to, but we now know that she is spending her time hanging out with a bizarre cast-list of far-right characters, while spreading conspiracy theories and refusing to challenge the idea Tommy Robinson is a ‘hero’.

“That Rishi Sunak still hasn’t withdrawn the Tory whip from his predecessor shows how weak he is. By allowing her to bring these divisive, deluded and dangerous views into mainstream British politics, the Tory party is poisoning public discourse.”

A spokesperson for Truss did not respond to a request for comment.

Truss’s trip to CPAC – one of several visits she has made to the US since leaving office just over a year ago – has caused problems for her in the UK. She has faced criticism for appearing on a platform with Bannon, a far-right strategist, and for alleging that she had to resign because of a plot by the “deep state”.

Her comments at the conference’s international summit were particularly controversial, where she told attenders: “People are joining the civil service who are essentially activists. They might be trans activists, they might be environmental extremists, but they are now having a voice within the civil service in a way I don’t think was true 30 or 40 years ago.”

Video footage of the event shows Truss spoke after Nigel Farage, indicating the greater celebrity status of the former Ukip leader on the American right. Other speakers included Miklós Szánthó, the director of a rightwing thinktank in Hungary with close ties to Orbán, and Szabolcs Takács, the Hungarian ambassador to the US.

The event was also addressed by Jay Aeba, a prominent Japanese conservative and representative of the Happy Science movement, whose followers regard their leader as the incarnation of a supreme being from Venus.

In the audience was Tuberville, the US senator, who when asked during an interview last year whether white supremacists were racist, replied: “Well that’s your opinion.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Speaking on Political Currency, the podcast he hosts with the former Labour cabinet minister Ed Balls, Osborne said he had been told Sunak’s team were working towards the date in mid-November as the target for an election.

Sunak has said his “working assumption” is that he will hold the vote in the second half of the year, while Conservative sources say a final decision has not yet been taken over a date.

Osborne, who is close to many of those around Sunak, told the podcast: “A little birdie has told me that the various work programmes required to get ready for a general election have that date singled out – 14 November.

“By the way, logic leads you there because you’re not going to have it in the first half of the year. I mean, this pretence that Rishi Sunak could have a May election was something we discussed last year. It’s a non-starter. He’s more than 20 points behind in the opinion polls. He’s not going to have a spring election.

He added: “So then you’re left with the autumn. And you’re probably thinking: ‘I know, we’ll have the party conference as a kind of launch pad. We’ll fit in an autumn statement, like a mini-budget, either before that or immediately after it.’ And that kind of leads you into mid-November. So 14 November kind of writes itself.”

Sunak has until January 2025 to hold an election, and Labour politicians had speculated that he would do so in May this year. Earlier this month however the prime minister clarified that he was thinking of a date in the second half of the year.

He told broadcasters during a visit to Nottingham: “My working assumption is we’ll have a general election in the second half of this year and in the meantime I’ve got lots that I want to get on with.”

Tory sources do not deny they have an election date in mind, but say they are retaining the flexibility to move it if needed.

An election on 14 November would mean Sunak announcing it at or around the Conservative party conference in early October. It would also mean the second general election in a row which has been fought in the colder months.

With the Conservatives 18 points behind in the polls, many of their strategists believe they should leave it as late as possible to call an election to give the economy and public services time to recover. The Bank of England now forecasts inflation to fall to 2% by April, while Sunak says he thinks NHS waiting lists will begin falling in a sustained way this spring.

Osborne said Sunak had made a mistake in the first few weeks of the year, however, by focusing on immigration rather than the economy. “I was listening at home, I was thinking: why are you going on about immigration and asylum seekers and Rwanda again? That’s how we ended last year, and it’s a mess.

“I’m not saying immigration’s not a very important issue, but let’s be honest, it’s not like the public think that the Conservatives have got a grip on it at the moment. You should be talking about the economy.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

But Galloway, who has a 10,140 majority, denied that the intermediary had pretended to be Shah’s late father in order to dupe clerics into handing over the marriage documentation.

Officials from his Respect party dispute that Naz Shah, Labour’s candidate in Bradford West, was forced into marriage, on the grounds that her mother was at the ceremony.

Shah made the impersonation claim at highly charged hustings in Bradford on Wednesday night after Galloway produced what he claimed was her nikah, her Islamic marriage certificate. Telling her she had “only a passing acquaintance with the truth”, Galloway said: “You claimed – and gullible journalists believed you – that you were subject to a forced marriage at the age of 15. But you were not 15, you were 16 and a half. I have your nikah in my pocket.”

The age difference mattered, he suggested, because it “slandered” the Pakistani community and played into “every stereotype”. He was cheered by a large contingent of the Bradford crowd and heckled by others.

Shah, who has spoken about being forced into a violent and sexually abusive marriage aged 15, then accused Galloway’s contact in Mirpur, in Pakisani Kashmir, of impersonating her father, Abid Shah, who has been dead for many years.

Vowing to sue Galloway for defamation after the general election, she said she could prove that she had first married on 25 December 1988 when she had just turned 15.

On Thursday she told the Guardian she had instructed a lawyer in Mirpur to go the office of the muftis, or religious clerics, and obtain the 1988 nikah. She said that nikah arrived in Bradford on Wednesday. The Guardian has seen a copy of the 1988 nikah.

Shah also insisted that there were two nikahs in existence – the first, from 1988, and the second from 1990, which she claimed was obtained in order that her Pakistani husband could get a spouse visa to come and live with her in the UK. She said the British authorities would not have allowed her husband to come into the country with her had they known she was only 15 at the time of the marriage.

This claim was rubbished by Galloway’s spokesman Ron McKay, who said in an email: “You cannot have two nikahs to the same person Islamically – without going through a divorce first. Any divorce would show on a nikah and there is none.”

Asked where and how Galloway had obtained the nikah he waved around at the hustings, McKay said: “We were first given a copy of the nikah by a close family member in this country. We wanted to verify that it was authentic so we arranged for a person in Mirpur to obtain a copy directly from the registry office. There was no duplicity involved. And both versions are identical.

“The person did not pretend to be Abid Shah who, I understand, was extremely well-known in the area and it would have been widely known that he had died. That person provided an identity card which was photocopied and, I believe, a fee was paid, which is, I understand, the normal process. I repeat that there was no subterfuge. Every applicant has to provide identity which is photocopied. Further, I understand that the original document had to come from Chakswari and that there was a two or three days’ delay before it was picked up.



“If Naz Shah has any document then she should produce it and we will have it checked for authenticity with the Mirpur register office.”

Asked whether Galloway disputed Shah’s claim to have been forced into a violent marriage as a teenager – be that at 15 or 16 and a half – and was repeatedly raped in that marriage, McKay said: “In what sense was it a forced marriage? Her mother attended the marriage in 1990 as well as other family members and many witnesses did also, signing and giving fingerprints, so if it was forced presumably her mother and the others were part of that coercion?”

The government’s Forced Marriage Unit makes clear that parents are often the instigators of forced marriage, coercing their offspring to marry against their will.

McKay said that if Shah’s first husband had been violent to her, “then as a British citizen in Pakistan she could have jumped on a plane and left him behind, although I do appreciate that is often extremely difficult. If he was violent to her here – I’m not aware when they came back to Britain – then she could have gone to the police, social services, an imam or whatever. I am not aware, are you, of any such report by her to anyone, here or there?”

But he said Respect was in contact with Shah’s first husband, who has “strongly denied any earlier nikah” or doing her “absolutely any harm”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

During a round of BBC local radio interviews to promote spending moved from HS2 to local transport projects, the prime minister was quizzed on Anderson’s claim that the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was controlled by Islamists, remarks for which he lost the Conservative whip.

Asked on Radio York if his party had Islamophobic tendencies, he replied: “No, of course it doesn’t. And I think it’s incumbent on all of us, especially those elected to parliament, not to inflame our debates in a way that’s harmful to others.”

Speaking to Radio Humberside, Sunak rejected the idea that the Conservatives used a de facto hierarchy of racism in which antisemitism was condemned but Islamophobia was allowed to run unchecked.

“I believe racism or prejudice of any kind is completely unacceptable, and we must stamp it out,” Sunak said, not mentioning the specific idea of anti-Muslim prejudice.

In comments that run notably contrary to those of Anderson, the former Tory party vice-chair, and Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, who argued last week that Islamists were now “in charge”, Sunak said the UK was the “most successful multi-ethnic democracy in the world”.

He went on: “That’s because we have a way of doing these things, of respecting everyone, and at the same time ensuring that everyone integrates into our community and subscribes to a common set of British values.

“And that’s why, as I said, racism or prejudice of any kind is completely unacceptable.”

Sunak’s refusal to engage with the specific idea of anti-Muslim prejudice – which follows the refusal of Mark Harper, the transport secretary, in his own round of media interviews on Monday morning, to say whether Anderson had been racist – is likely to increase concern among some Tories.

Sayeeda Warsi, the Conservative peer who was a cabinet minister in David Cameron’s government, told the Guardian on Sunday that Sunak needed to “find the language” to “call Islamophobia Islamophobia”.

“What is it about the prime minister that he can’t even call out anti-Muslim racism and anti-Muslim bigotry? Why can’t he just use those words?” she said.

Asked by Sky News whether Anderson’s description of Khan, including the claim he had “given our capital city away to his mates”, was motivated by prejudice against the mayor, who is Muslim, Harper refused to say.

“Well, it was wrong,” he said. “And I’m not going to get into arguing about the rights and wrongs. What he said was wrong, and in my book, wrong is a strong word.”

Harper indicated it was possible Anderson, who lost the Conservative whip on Saturday after his comments the previous evening on GB News, could return to the Tory fold if he apologised.

“That’s not a matter for me, that’s a matter for the chief whip,” Harper said. “I’ve been chief whip in the past. I’m not going to tell the chief whip how to do his job.”

He added: “[Anderson] said things about Sadiq Khan that weren’t true and that were quite wrong to say. He was given the opportunity to retract those comments and to apologise for them. He didn’t do so, so very clear, decisive leadership was taken and the whip has been removed really from him.”

Asked what message it would send to British Muslims if Anderson was given back the whip, Harper added: “I think … the firm and decisive leadership that took the whip away from him very quickly, when he refused to retract and apologise, sends a very strong message that we don’t tolerate people saying such things in the Conservative party.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

“I thought we would be like … ‘here we go, here we go. We are going to become the most competitive country in Europe and we are going to be encouraging business.’ Now I think: ‘What have we done?’”

His firm, Stewart Superior, has survived, but not without major restructuring and huge efforts to get around obstacles that Brexit has put in the way of the export side of the business.

In late 2020 Betts decided there was no option but to set up a depot inside the EU single market – in the Netherlands – at considerable expense, to avoid costly delays in transit, mountains of Brexit-related paperwork at the border, and VAT issues when sending goods to customers on the continent.

The switch means that, 18 months on, he has retained a decent slice of trade with customers inside the EU. But because his goods are now distributed from the Dutch depot, tax revenues which would have gone to the UK exchequer now go to the Dutch government instead. Jobs have been created in Holland, not here. Goods that would have been transported from the UK – and created work and employment here – are instead sent direct from the Netherlands to EU destinations, including Ireland.

Last year, with Covid adding to its problems, Stewart Superior lost money for the first time in 20 years.

Betts is “very disappointed” with the UK government. “We are not shipping anything like the amount we were. As a country, we were supposed to be out there trading with the world and yet nothing has happened except we have got a load more paperwork and we have lost lots of our business. It is completely bonkers.”

Asked whether, with hindsight, he would vote Leave if there was a referendum today, Betts says: “I think on the basis of what has happened, I would say No.”

Stewart Superior is one of several small businesses the Observer has been tracking since Boris Johnson finally settled on a hard Brexit and signed a free trade agreement which came into force in January 2021.

Others report the same frustrations. Markets for their goods are there, they say, with potential customers aplenty in the EU. But new obstacles to trade, and hidden costs for customers (particularly demands for VAT on delivery to their doors), as well as the soaring costs of imports caused in part by the post-Brexit devaluation of sterling, mean that in many cases it is simply not worth accessing them.

Unless – that is – companies open a branch back inside the same single market the UK left 18 months ago.

Gyr King, chief executive of King & McGaw, a firm with turnover of more than £10m, which sells fine art prints online from Newhaven, on the south coast, says he has all but stopped exporting to the EU because Brexit-related costs and bureaucracy make it uneconomic.

In some cases he has dispatched artworks to EU destinations only to have them sent back because customers have refused to pay VAT on arrival. For legal reasons, the same goods have had to be sent on another slow and costly journey back to the UK, meaning a big bill landing on King’s desk for an unsold, bespoke item.

In King’s view, Johnson’s hard Brexit defies one basic rule of economics. “If you can’t ship your goods into the biggest market on your doorstep, you have got to be shooting yourself in the foot,” he says.

Leaving the EU has also made it far more difficult to recruit the skilled workers he needs, because the UK no longer enjoys the benefits of free movement of labour. “Brexit has clearly not helped because the reservoir from which we are drawing is much smaller,” he says.

Six years after the referendum which took the UK out of the EU, the economic case for Brexit is proving increasingly difficult for its supporters – including inside the Conservative party – to make.

Most of the trade deals with non-EU countries that the UK has signed have been small in their economic effect, and have merely been “rolled over” from identical ones when we were an EU member. Even Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities, has stopped talking about Brexit and the UK economy, and instead focuses on what he says is the democratic dividend, the winning back of control, and the return of sovereignty. That is not surprising because day by day the economic data is piling up showing the harm that leaving the EU is doing to the nation’s finances.

Johnson and the Vote Leave campaign promised in 2016 that £350m a week would flow back from Brussels because we would stop contributing to EU coffers.

The impression was that there would be no downside. We would thrive outside Europe’s bureaucracy which was strangling our companies with red tape. The huge benefits of the single market – trading freely across borders, with common standards – were never highlighted by Vote Leave, and rarely by the crudely alarmist Remain camp, either.

Only now, with the worst of the pandemic (probably) behind us, and ministers unable to blame Covid, is Brexit reality being laid bare.

Next year the OECD calculates that the UK will record the lowest growth in the G20 with the exception of Russia whose economy is being drained by its war on Ukraine.

The Office for Budget Responsibility says Brexit will have a long-term effect of cutting UK GDP by a hefty 4%, an estimate unchanged since early 2020. The Financial Times says such a decline amounts to £100bn in lost output, and £40bn less revenue to the Treasury a year. The UK is now behind all the other G7 nations in the pace of its recovery from the pandemic, with exports by UK small businesses to the EU down significantly.

Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank of England’s nine-member monetary policy committee, said on Friday that Brexit was “disconnecting the UK from its main trading partners” in a clear example of de-globalisation. An expert at Imperial College on ways to improve productivity, Haskel warned in 2019 that British business investment would likely be weak for several years because of uncertainty linked to Brexit.

Figures from the Centre for European Reform show that the Brexit vote has already depressed economic growth. The independent thinktank said that by the end of last year the economy was 5% – or £31bn – smaller than if the UK had stayed in the EU. Faced with all this, arch-Brexiters are increasingly turning on Johnson. They don’t admit Brexit was a mistake but say it has not yet been made to work.

Richard Tice, the leader of Reform UK, successor to the Brexit party, told the Observer that the grand ideal was still a good one. “Brexit has given us our sovereignty back, so we can make our own laws, and control our money and borders and not be subject to the European Court of Justice.”

It was just that the rich fruits of Brexit were not yet there to savour because “in its utter incompetence, the Tory government has failed to take much advantage so far, with a few exceptions such as being able to do our own earlier vaccine rollout and some trade deals”.

Tory defeats in Thursday’s Tiverton and Honiton and Wakefield byelections suggest that behind the “red wall” and “blue wall” the electoral benefits of saying Johnson “got Brexit done” are not what they were.

In the south-west seat many farmers believed promises on Brexit had been betrayed. There was a sense of rural revolt. Fertiliser and feed prices have soared recently, and payment systems for farmers are mired in confusion.

A constituency steeped in West Country Euroscepticism voted for a profoundly pro-EU party, the Liberal Democrats, sending a tremor through the Conservative party. Other sectors harbour feelings of Brexit betrayal, as the memories of Covid lockdowns fade.

The fishing industry – promised a new lease of life out of the EU – is on the verge of crisis, with rising fuel costs making it almost uneconomic to catch fish, particularly as exporting to the EU is now so burdensome. Trawler crew working on a share of profits now earn less than £3 an hour after diesel is paid for, despite fish being at record prices.

Sarah Ready of the New Under Ten Fishermen’s Association, whose boats are under 10 metres long, said red tape had been increasing since the Brexit vote, and they now faced extra hurdles selling their catches.

Brexit was not supposed to be this way. “Some of the requirements have certainly come since Brexit,” she said. “I think Brexit was a very nasty divorce between us and Europe and obviously they’re not going to make it easy for us on any manner of things.” Paperwork relating to health and hygiene, EU import rules and other monitoring requirements had grown dramatically.

Rees-Mogg said last week he had no intention of monitoring the economic effects of Brexit. “I’m not going to make those sorts of assessments because lots were made before the referendum and they are all bilge,” he said.

Ministers cannot hide reality much longer. What Rees-Mogg was referring to were predictions. Now we have facts, evidence of Brexit affecting people’s lives. Those flying off on holiday can see queues at airports, longer than before Brexit, and ask: why?

Last week the chief executive of easyJet, Johan Lundgren, contradicted claims by the aviation minister Robert Courts that it was “not likely” Brexit had caused staff shortages which have led to disruption at airports. Lundgren countered that 8,000 job applications from EU citizens had been rejected by his firm because candidates did not have permission to work in the UK.

“The pool of people is smaller, it’s just maths,” Lundgren said. “We have had to turn down a huge number of EU nationals because of Brexit. Pre-pandemic we would have turned down 2-2.5% because of nationality issues. Now it’s 35-40%.”

The permanent state of war Johnson’s government maintains with the EU – blaming it for problems caused by the very Brexit deal he negotiated – is making things even worse.

Take UK science. When the UK was in the EU we played a leading role in the Horizon scheme funding research projects across Europe. We provided more lead researchers than any other European nation and received the second largest funding of any member country.

After Brexit, there was a provisional deal for the UK to continue in Horizon – which backs projects from particle physics to vaccine research – as an associated nation. The UK would pay £15bn into the scheme over seven years while its scientists could still bid for Horizon funding.

Then came the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol, an issue that so infuriated the EU it has refused to ratify Britain’s associate membership of the €95bn scheme. Those UK scientists who have received recent grants have been told they must move to an EU country to retain access to funds. Those affected include Cambridge astronomer Nicholas Walton who relinquished leadership of a €2.8m star-mapping project to a colleague in the Netherlands, while Carsten Welsch, a Liverpool University physicist, winner of a €2.6m Horizon grant for plasma research, has been told either to move to the EU or hand over leadership to an EU institution – a situation he describes as “heartbreaking”.

The government is working on a plan that would make up for some of the funding lost if our association with Horizon breaks down, as expected. The result will be less cash for UK science, loss of partnerships with the best European scientists, and a reduced international reputation for our researchers.

Another small UK business which the Observer has followed since January last year sells packaging and point-of-sale marketing displays in this country and the EU. Based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, it employs a few dozen people. Its managing director Andrew Moss, like Geoffrey Betts, has gone to hell and back trying to find ways to survive Brexit. He too has set up a distribution depot in the Netherlands. Also like Betts he feels he has got around Brexit’s blockages, but at a huge cost.

“Our growth stopped five years ago,” says Moss. “70% of our turnover was international before Brexit. It went from 70% to 50% to 30%. We would be twice the size we are now if it were not for Brexit.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The mayor of London said Anderson’s comments were Islamophobic and put across the notion that Muslims were “fair game” when it came to racism.

He also lambasted the prime minister for failing to condemn his own MP’s remarks, saying Rishi Sunak and his the cabinet were now complicit.

Khan’s comments come after Anderson, the MP for Ashfield, said in a Friday night appearance on GB News that the mayor Khan had “given our capital away” to Islamists, referring to the latter as Khan’s “mates”.

Khan responded on Saturday morning, telling Sky News: “These comments from a senior Conservative are Islamophobic, are anti-Muslim and are racist.”

00:00:35 Islamists control Sadiq Khan, claims Tory MP Lee Anderson – video

He pointed to a recent surge in hate crimes, adding: “These comments pour fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred.

“I am afraid the deafening silence form Rishi Sunak and from the cabinet is them condoning this racism.

“I am afraid it confirms to many people across the country that there’s a hierarchy when it comes to racism.

“I am unclear why Rishi Sunak, why members of his cabinet aren’t calling this out and aren’t condemning this.

“It’s like they are complicit in this sort of racism. The message it sends is Muslims are fair game when it comes to racism and anti-Muslim hatred.

“It’s not good enough in 2024 in the United Kingdom.”

Tory and Labour MPs have expressed their disgust at Anderson’s remarks, with the former chancellor Sajid Javid calling them “ridiculous”. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said they were “a total disgrace”.

The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) had earlier called for Anderson to be kicked out of the parliamentary party.

The MCB said the comment was “disgusting” and criticised the “silence of the party in the face of such extremism”.

A spokesperson added: “In a week where we learn of an explosion in Islamophobic hate crimes, influential MPs and a donor to the Conservative party are endorsing common talking points that peddle conspiracy theories and Islamophobic tropes of alleged Muslim takeovers of our country.”

Labour’s chair, Anneliese Dodds, later wrote to her Conservative counterpart, Ric Holden, calling on him to take “serious, concrete action” on Islamophobia in the Tory party.

She said Anderson’s comments were “the tip of iceberg”, and a continuation of a “deeply concerning pattern of Islamophobic comments tolerated and Islamophobia not dealt with”.

She added: “Lee Anderson’s comments were unambiguously Islamophobic and Rishi Sunak’s failure to suspend the whip or take any other action speaks volumes …

“Sunak has a clear choice: show some backbone and withdraw the whip or be forever known as the Tory leader who was too weak to stop the far-right rhetoric in his own party.”

The letter states that, despite a review into Islamophobia in the Tory party in 2021, the party has failed to meaningfully tackle it.

The chorus of condemnation over Anderson continued on Saturday, with the business minister Nus Ghani describing her fellow Tory MP’s comments as “foolish and dangerous”.

In a post on X, she said: “I have spoken to Lee Anderson. I’ve called out Islamic extremism (& been attacked by hard left, far right & Islamists).

“I don’t for one moment believe that Sadiq Khan is controlled by Islamists. To say so, is both foolish and dangerous. Frankly this is all so tiring ….”

The Conservative peer Gavin Barwell, who was Theresa May’s chief of staff in No 10, described the comment as a “despicable slur”.

Neil Garratt, leader of the Conservatives at City Hall, said he had “no shortage of criticisms of Mayor Khan” but added “he is not an Islamist, he is not in the pockets of Islamists, and I completely disagree with anyone who says otherwise”.

The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, called the comments “a total disgrace” and said they “whipped up hate at a time our country needs to come together”. He asked Sunak: “When will you act to remove the Conservative party whip?”

The former Conservative chancellor Sajid Javid was among those who criticised Anderson’s comments, calling it a “ridiculous thing to say”.

Asked on Saturday morning whether Anderson should lose the Tory whip, the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, said the matter was “one for the party itself”. He declined to say whether the MP for Ashfield was a good representative voice for the Tories, saying only that “we live in a democracy where people are allowed to speak their mind and Lee Anderson, I think, is famed for speaking his mind”.

It comes in a week in which former prime minister Liz Truss had used a talk at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in the US to claim her efforts to cut taxes were “sabotaged” by the “administrative state and the deep state”.

The former prime minister later took part in an interview with the former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and remained silent as he hailed the far-right figure Tommy Robinson a “hero”.

Javid criticised her for not challenging the comment, saying: “I’d hope every MP would confront such a statement head on. Liz should really know better.”

In a letter to Sunak on Friday, the shadow paymaster general, Jonathan Ashworth, said “egregious” remarks made by Truss and Anderson “cannot go unchecked or unchallenged”.

The Muslim Council of Britain welcomed Anderson’s suspension but said the Conservative party has “an Islamophobia problem” and his remarks are “only the tip of an iceberg”.

A Conservative spokesperson said: “An investigation and subsequent independent review, both conducted over several years by Prof Swaran Singh, found no evidence of institutional racism in the Conservative party.”

Speaking before Khan’s comments, a Conservative party source said: “Lee was simply making the point that the mayor, in his capacity as PCC (police and crime commissioner) for London, has abjectly failed to get a grip on the appalling Islamist marches we have seen in London recently.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

When you’re in a hole, it’s generally best to stop digging. So after a spectacular display of pompous self-indulgence and partisan politics from MPs of all parties during an opposition day debate on Gaza the night before, the least you might have expected was a little contrition on Thursday morning. A walk of shame into the Commons. MPs trying not to catch one another’s eyes. We’ve all had a drink …

And it all started off quite well during culture departmental questions. Everyone was determined not to mention the war. No, not that one in the Middle East. The one that had been fought across the dispatch box. The one that MPs were really bothered about. The speaker was also in his chair. Everyone wanted to pretend everything was normal. “Yes, Mr Speaker; no, Mr Speaker.” The only hint that anything was amiss was the excessive politeness.

The tip-toeing continued through two urgent questions. The junior business minister Kevin Hollinrake bowing and scraping so low as he suggested Labour’s Kevan Jones knew far more about the Horizon Post Office scandal than he did. After the second UQ, on the government’s decision to cut funding to an inter-faith group – no one dared to point out the irony in the timing of this – Lindsay Hoyle made his excuses and left. It had been a long two hours for him. Exhausting.

So it was left to the shadow leader of the house, Lucy Powell, to mention the elephant in the room during business questions. Lucy was never a prize student at charm school. She finds it easier to make enemies than friends. There is a brusqueness to her. An awkwardness she can’t quite shake off. But she wanted to try to make amends for Wednesday’s fiasco. An olive twig. If not a branch.

It was like this, she said. She accepted that Labour hadn’t exactly covered itself in glory. The party had been in a hole over the Gaza vote and had talked the speaker into changing the parliamentary procedures to get around it. The sort of thing any party would do in a similar situation. They could hardly be blamed for trying it on.

But then no one was totally guilt-free. The Scottish National party had chosen the Gaza motion as much to embarrass Labour as anything else. It wasn’t as if the result of the vote would make a blind bit of difference to Israel or Hamas. And the Tories were in it up to their neck. They had tabled their own amendment that was almost identical to Labour’s purely as a wrecking motion and had been furious to be outmanoeuvred. They had then got panicked about losing their vote and had thrown their toys out the pram and walked out. Cue chaos.

Powell paused, looked up from her script and made this offer. How about everyone owned up to their own part in the humiliation of the vanities? No need to make a big deal about it. Don’t worry about the embarrassing details. Just mumble something vaguely apologetic. Miss Otis Regrets. Enough to give the public the impression that MPs had a few basic signs of emotional intelligence. Then we could all move on. Pretend it had never happened.

This sounded like a decent offer. Only not to the Commons leader, Penny Mordaunt. A walking disaster of emotional stupidity. Not to mention brazen dishonesty. A woman incapable of recognising the most basic truths. Who thinks that her brief cameo at the coronation has given her iconic status. A Britannia for the 21st century.

Planet Earth to Penny. Planet Earth to Penny. Is there anyone there? Apparently not. All you did was carry a sword for a while. OK, you did it well. But it wasn’t that hard. You can’t go on expecting the rest of us to thank you for ever. Yet Penny is in Penny World. Seldom has any woman taken herself quite so seriously. Apart from Liz Truss, possibly. And just as deranged. Of all the days to launch your latest leadership bid, this was not the one. Not least because she’ll be lucky to keep her seat at the next election.

Penny was all ice. The theatrical fury of the intellectually compromised. Unable to see that putting all the blame on to Labour and exonerating Hoyle was an untenable position. The speaker is not without agency. Worse, she had the nerve to pretend that all she cared about was the little people.

The rights of the SNP. Mordaunt has never cared about the SNP. Walking out before the vote was all about creating a diversion away from a possible defeat for the government. Nothing more, nothing less. To pretend otherwise was an insult to the country. At a time when people were hoping for something better from their MPs, Penny chose to kick them in the teeth again. As for parliamentary conventions? She has never cared for them either. Anyone remember the prorogation? Mordaunt would rather you didn’t. Though she was a fan at the time.

To their credit, Penny’s preening display of sanctimony was too much for many of her Tory MPs. It’s hard to imagine there ever being a time and place for such self-indulgent denial, but this certainly wasn’t it. Most chose to ignore her. To distance themselves from her by refusing to pander to her hauteur. Some took her on. None better than Mark Francois. Not a sentence I would ever imagine writing.

Francois is often a purple ball of inchoate anger. Seething at a world he doesn’t understand. That refuses to bend to his will. On Thursday, the storm clouds had temporarily parted. No one came out well from the Gaza omnishambles. No one. That was directed pointedly at Penny. Nor was everyone perfect. Hoyle had admitted his mistake. Now was the time for forgiveness. Magnanimity. A time of grace.

Not for the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn. He was going to pursue this one to the ends of the earth. Lindsay was guilty of the greatest possible sin. Crimes against the SNP. Flynn would be happy to take part in the firing squad. Though you might have thought he could have granted a royal pardon. The SNP was coming out of this one smelling of roses. With another opposition day debate in the bag.

Then Hoyle himself intervened. Again he fessed up. He had made a mistake. He was sorry. He wished it had turned out otherwise. He hadn’t been nobbled by the Labour heavies. It had been the threat of violence to MPs. He couldn’t live with another phone call saying a friend had been murdered.

Penny grunted. She wasn’t happy. Not ready to think through the implications of parliamentary democracy being undermined by terror groups. She tried to sound understanding but she spat out the words as if she had swallowed a wasp. Lindsay had been weak. Weak, I tell you. She would never have given in. Some things were worth dying for. And Erskine May was one of them.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Two weeks ago, Donald Trump admitted that he would encourage Russia to ‘do whatever the hell they want’ to the US’s Nato allies, if they did not meet Trump’s demand to ‘pay their fair share’ of Nato funding. He also compared himself to the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny when discussing one of his many legal woes. All the while, the military aid package passed by the Senate last week, which includes $60bn for Ukraine, has stalled in the House of Representatives.

So how worried should the US’s allies be about a second Trump presidency? What happens if the Republican party’s isolationist streak becomes the policy of the entire US? And in the meantime, how can Biden protect Ukraine when Congress refuses to act?

Buckland, the Tory MP for South Swindon and a former justice secretary, criticised his colleagues for “dangerous” rhetoric in the past week.

The Conservatives have been warring over a series of interventions and remarks where Tory MPs have flirted with far-right sentiment.

Lee Anderson, who was deputy chair of the party until a month ago, told GB News on Friday that Islamists had “got control of” Sadiq Khan and that the London mayor had “given our capital city away to his mates”. He was stripped of the Tory whip after refusing to apologise.

Buckland told Broadcasting House on BBC Radio 4 that Anderson’s remark was “racist” and “repugnant”. “This man has crossed a line, very clearly,” he said. “A number of colleagues, notably Sajid Javid, me and others, noted this and expressed our view, and the party’s acted.

“It is wrong to conflate whole groups of people that are based on race or ethnicity with extremists. To start to conflate issues is dangerous. If it’s being done deliberately, then it is absolutely unacceptable. Even if it’s being done inadvertently, it’s careless, it’s reckless, and it doesn’t help us deal with the serious issues.”

The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg on BBC One that he did not believe Anderson was “intending to be Islamophobic”. He would have kept the whip had he apologised, Dowden said.

Asked about Braverman’s claim that Islamists were running the country, Dowden said he disagreed but that her remarks were “in a different category” because they were not directed at any individual. “I don’t believe that what Suella has said crosses the line in the way that Lee Anderson’s comments do,” he said.

Braverman, a former home secretary under Rishi Sunak, wrote in the Telegraph last week that “the truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now”.

Asked about her comments, Buckland said: “To then say that we are being controlled or that they are in charge is, I think, to ramp things up in a way that is inaccurate, unnecessary and doesn’t actually allow us to have a proper debate to confront these people on an accurate basis.”

Buckland was also asked about Liz Truss, the former prime minister, who took part in an interview with Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist to Donald Trump, and remained silent as Bannon hailed the far-right figure Tommy Robinson as a “hero”.

Buckland said: “It beggars belief to know what on earth was going on there … It is important that when people like this are being lauded as some sort of hero, that there’s challenge.

“Any sort of suggestion that somehow this is a real conservatism and that people like me are Conservatives in name only is the opposite of the truth.”

“What we stand for, proper Conservatives stand for, is bringing the country together and seeking to unify, challenging criminality and hate and extremism absolutely square on, and being honest and truthful about it – but bringing the country together, not dividing it.

“That’s what the proper Conservative vision is. That’s what the Conservative party that I joined believes in, and anybody else who doesn’t agree with that agenda and wants to fight had better get out and join another party, because that is not the Conservative party that I and millions of others believe in.”

During the 2022 Tory leadership contest, Buckland initially supported Sunak but then switched to Truss.

In an apparent swipe at Sunak, who appointed Anderson and Braverman to senior roles, Buckland said: “People talk about rottweilers or attack dogs in politics. The danger with having attack dogs with a licence to roam free is that sometimes they bite you on the hand, and that’s what’s been happening.”

Dowden told the BBC that Truss “should have called it out” when Bannon lauded Robinson.

During her trip to the US last week, Truss said she would like to see Nigel Farage become a Tory party member and suggested she could work with him to reshape the party.

Dowden insisted that Farage would not be welcome. “I, like many hundreds of thousands of Conservatives up and down the country, have spent many years campaigning against parties led by Nigel Farage,” he told Sky News. “So no, I don’t support Nigel Farage to be joining the Conservative party.”

There is speculation that since losing the Tory whip, Anderson could join the rightwing populist party Reform UK, which is linked to Farage.

Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader, said he was not in touch with Anderson. “As far as I’m concerned, this appears to be an internal squabble within the Conservative party about language,” he told Times Radio.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The accompanying white burgundy has citrus, grilled nuts and ripe apple on the nose, orchard fruits and wet pebbles on the palate, and a citrus-tinged finish.

The menu for the Winter Party is agreed. The chefs are at work. There are only hours left before the fund­raising event of the year begins. It is 25 February 2020. Today, Mohamed Amersi will be where he has long wanted to be, seated among the highest in the land.

Born to a trading family in Kenya in 1960, three years before independence from Britain, Amersi attended Merchant Taylors’, a private school in Hertfordshire, before studying medicine and law at Sheffield University then at Cambridge. From there Amersi went from one prestigious law firm, Clifford Chance, to another, Jones Day (a “star” of its Swiss office, the trade press said), before becoming a dealmaker in the global telecoms industry. Short and smart, a neat greying plume above his hawkish features, on his charitable foundation’s website he is a “renowned global communications entrepreneur, philanthropist and thought leader”.

At 10.35am, an email goes round the Conservatives’ fundraising team with the subject line “Amersi”. The email reads: “Can we arrange for Amersi to get a table swing-by and name check from the PM? Initially Amersi wanted a shout out from stage but it’s too public and not fair on others. In short he is starting a Friends of the Middle East and North Africa which to be fair, would have some of the best group fundraising potential if done right. He wants someone to say this guy is behind a new and very promising concept – Friends of MENA”.

If ever there was a PM with the vim for a memorable table swing-by, it is Boris Johnson. He has been taking good care of himself lately. A holiday on Mustique, staying at a lovely villa arranged by one of tonight’s guests, the boss of Carphone Warehouse. And this past fortnight he’s been at Chevening, the grace-and-favour getaway in Kent. A well-earned rest, now he’s Got Brexit Done. Sure, he’s missed a few meetings of the Cobra security committee discussing this coronavirus thing. But other urgent matters must be attended to. There’s his second wife to divorce, and the pregnancy of his future third to announce. He’s dashed back to London for the fundraising bash.

All is arranged. Amersi prepares to receive Johnson’s favour. As Amersi himself has said, political donors are not philanthropists. They expect something in return.

Amersi’s entry to the Conservative fraternity starts in 2015, with an invitation to London’s most secretive club. “I am sure you will find it a most enjoyable and informative evening,” Ben Elliot tells Amersi in an email, before moving on to the suggested donation size.

Tall, handsome, his Eton accent customised to Mockney, Elliot can get you into places others cannot go. If you want the Sydney Harbour Bridge to yourself, Elliot’s people will get you the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and you can propose on it. They will have the doors to Shanghai’s couture boutiques closed to the public so that your wife is undisturbed while she shops on her birthday. For a fee of £15,000 a year or more, clients of Quintessentially, Elliot’s concierge service for the rich, party beside pyramids and dine on icebergs. If they want to stay at home, but wish their home was the Batcave, a Batcave Elliot’s people will build.

Elliot’s insertion of his Quintessentially client Amersi into royal circles is proceeding apace. In 2013, Elliot arranged for his Aunt Camilla’s husband, Charles – the heir to the British throne – to receive Amersi at Dumfries House, a royal Scottish retreat. With Amersi was Nadia Rodicheva, a Russian 17 years his junior.

The day after he returned to London after dining with Prince Charles, an email arrived for Amersi from Kenneth Dunsmuir of the trust that owns Dumfries House: “It was a real pleasure to meet both you and Nadia during your visit to Dumfries House at the weekend. I very much hope that you enjoyed your short stay with us and that your onward journey yesterday passed smoothly.” Documents were attached. They contained planned improvements to the estate that benefactors might wish to fund. One was an outdoor activity area.

Amersi emailed his banker at Coutts. There was plenty in his accounts: he’d just finished six years advising one of the world’s biggest communications corporations on making corporate deals, at a rate of £19,000 a day. Send £130,000 to Dumfries House, Amersi commanded. Elliot had achieved the win-win: Amersi, a Quintessentially client, had taken his place among the royals, and the royals – Elliot’s relatives – had gained the benefit of Amersi’s money. “Well done,” Elliot emailed Amersi. “Lots to discuss with you.”

Now begins the entrée to real power. Mohamed has banked millions from his career as a dealmaker in emerging telecoms markets. His project now seems to be to fashion himself into a celebrated philanthropist, respected by the great and the good. The club to which Elliot has invited him, 5 Hertford Street, is only a five-minute walk across Mayfair from Amersi’s London townhouse. Beyond the doorman lies a place that is distinct from the one where stodgier Tories gather, the Carlton Club over in St James’s. At 5 Hertford Street, they’ve mixed in the new elite: celebrities such as George Clooney, Neymar, Lupita Nyong’o and Cara Delevingne, as well as young royals like Prince William, the heir to the heir to the throne. This is not to say that the future of the country is neglected by the punters at 5 Hertford Street. The instigators of Brexit gather here: Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, Michael Gove – the owner, Robin Birley, is a leave man, and glad to have them in.

It is Gove, a clever and gawky former journalist serving as David Cameron’s chief whip, to whom Amersi has the pleasure of listening during an intimate fundraiser in a 5 Hertford Street dining room in 2015. By the following year, the Brexiters have deposed Cameron. Theresa May succeeds him as prime minister. As she negotiates departure terms with the EU, May reads polls suggesting she could increase the Conservative majority in parliament. During a long walk in Wales, she resolves to call a snap election and crush Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour. The vote is set for 8 June 2017. For the campaign, her aides initially present her as an agent of change. Then they switch to calling her a “strong and stable” leader – one who calls a spade a spade, and Brexit Brexit. Then the strong and stable leader reverses the main policy in her manifesto.

The polls tighten. Even before this shambles, May has never been much of a fundraiser. Staggering from one mortification to the next, her campaign needs money.

With just weeks to go until polling day, Amersi offers to make his first political donation: £200,000. But there’s a hitch. He’s a non-dom – a tax status available to wealthy UK residents who say their main home is elsewhere and so pay fewer dues in Britain – and after all these years based in Dubai, Amersi’s not on the British electoral roll. And under the law, you have to be a registered voter to make a donation.

Amersi hastily applies to register as a voter, and on 28 April 2017 emails a Conservative party fundraiser, copying in Ben Elliot: “Can I now send the funds in my name or should Nadia do it?”

Rodicheva has been dazzling on Amersi’s arm as he tours the philanthropy circuit. London society has embraced her. There she was, just a few months ago in November 2016, posing for the cameras at the entrance to a fundraising fashion show just across Green Park from Buckingham Palace. Beside her, Amersi in a slick suit. Rodicheva has helped to put on the night. Jacques Azagury dresses the models, jewellery by Garrard. All sorts of names there: the designer Nicky Haslam, the personality Pinkietessa. It’s to raise funds for Camilla Parker Bowles’s osteoporosis charity. Rodicheva is a creative in her own right, of course, even if Amersi himself is the source of almost all the income at her interior design venture, English Story.

“I have just checked with compliance,” a Conservative functionary replies to Amersi’s question, “and you will not actually come on to the Electoral Roll until 1st June, so we cannot accept a donation from you until then”. And therefore: “The donation must please come from Nadia’s account.”

Important, this: not being on the roll, Amersi is what you call an “impermissible donor”. Accepting a donation from an impermissible donor could violate electoral law. And yet the email to arrange the payment does not begin “Dear Nadia”. It begins: “Dear Mr Amersi. Thank you so much for the extremely generous donation of £200k from Nadia. Please find below our bank details for the transfer.”

And the bank receipt for the payment is sent not to Nadia Rodicheva, but to Mohamed Amersi. What’s more, if this receipt is supposed to be proof that the money was Nadia’s – as it must be under electoral law, given that it is her name the Conservatives declare as the donor – that’s not what it appears to show. The account is at Union Bancaire Privée (UBP) in Geneva, the bank that has taken over Coutts’ Swiss operation. There are no human beings named, just a string of numbers and letters that identifies the bank’s address. Last year, I emailed Amersi to ask him: “If there is evidence to demonstrate that this is Nadia’s account, please provide it.” He replied: “None of your business.”

(Amersi has since told the Guardian that he and Rodicheva have a “joint relationship” with UBP, and the reason the bank receipt was sent to him – and not Rodicheva – was because he requested it, so he could forward it to the Conservative party. His lawyers shared redacted UBP documents that indicated it was Rodicheva who made the transaction from her sole account, which only she could make transactions from. Amersi said it was the Conservative party that suggested Rodicheva should donate the funds – a practice, he said, previously followed by other donors – and insisted it undertook a “lengthy” process to ensure the donation was legally compliant. The Conservative party did not respond to questions about the donation but said it “only accepts donations from permissible sources”. Yet all this raises questions for the party. What steps did it take, exactly, to satisfy itself that the funds came from Rodicheva’s account? And did the party and Amersi arrange Rodicheva’s donation to get around the fact that he was an impermissible donor?)

In 2017, however, these questions seem less pressing to the Conservatives than the materialising prospect that it might be about to cease doing the thing it exists to do – rule. The treasurer, a mining mogul called Mick Davis, emails Amersi and Rodicheva on 30 May: “Thank you again for your recent extremely generous donation for the General Election Fighting Fund of £200,000. Your financial support has been exemplary. Your commitment is really very much appreciated, especially for this crucial election. I guess every party treasurer has claimed that their campaign is era defining, well I feel our one next week really is just that. The outcome of course will not just effect [sic] Brexit negotiations but determine whether Corbyn’s socialist agenda can be killed off for another generation. You will have seen that the polls have tightened and the fight is most definitely on.”

Even as he thanks Amersi and Rodicheva, the treasurer asks for more. Lynton Crosby, the Tories’ Australian election guru, has a shopping list for the final week: £500,000 for Facebook videos, more for ads that wrap over the front pages of newspapers. Davis asks: could you manage another £15,000? “We are in Madagascar and slightly out of touch with events,” Amersi replies 20 minutes later. “It’s a pity about the tightening but at least complacency will not set in. We are happy to contribute a further £15,000.” Once more, the name entered on the donor registry is Rodicheva’s.

The Conservatives retain power. But they lose their majority. For a while, May clings on in Downing Street. She is still prime minister in 2018 when a new star on the Conservative scene, Mohamed Amersi, hosts the annual party fundraiser, the Carlton Club Dinner (this year held, conveniently for Amersi, at the Dorchester Hotel, round the back of his Mayfair townhouse). By now Amersi is on the electoral roll and able to donate in his own increasingly illustrious name. Just as he opted for “global elite” membership of Ben Elliot’s Quintessentially service, Amersi purchases membership of the Conservatives’ Leader’s Group. Fifty grand a year are the dues. That buys you monthly lunches with ministers.

Amersi and his chequebook attend the party’s 2019 Black and White Ball in Battersea. Lots of police are there to protect this elite gathering. Theresa May zooms in from Brexit negotiations in Northern Ireland to be present when an evening with her at the Proms is auctioned for the price of a medium-sized house. You can pay to go to Michael Gove’s home and have a meal cooked for you. Or for a cheese-tasting session with Liz Truss, then a minor minister known only for a speech in which she denounced the “disgrace” of Britain importing most of its cheese. Amersi parts with £50,000 for two lots: dinner with the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and a magic lesson, to be taught by international development secretary and former illusionist’s assistant Penny Mordaunt.

Eventually, the Conservatives’ Brexit frenzy consumes May and she tearfully announces her resignation in May 2019. Amersi spreads his largesse among the candidates: £10,000 apiece for Gove, Hunt and the Brexiters’ champion, Boris Johnson. In a moment of confusion and foreboding, Johnson triumphs. So breakfast with him is the most desirable lot at the next Carlton Club Dinner in 2019. Amersi wins the bidding with £100,000.

Johnson says only he can Get Brexit Done. He calls a new election and, in December 2019, regains the majority May lost. On average, £200,000 of campaign spending secures victory in one constituency. By that measure, the £500,000 Amersi has given since the last election would get you two-and-a-half seats. Not bad when the Conservative gain of 48 has given Johnson a commanding hold on power. Now, in February 2020, it’s on to the Winter Party (renamed this year – “Black and White Ball” is not a great look during a culture war). A time to reward friends.

Amersi emails the outreach team at Conservative headquarters the day before the Winter Party, regarding his plans for Comena, the Conservative Friends of the Middle East and North Africa. “From my side I have spoken to many Mid-East Ambassadors about this and they are hugely supportive. Indeed some of them will be on my table on Tuesday.” He has also discussed his plan with the man Johnson has appointed as new party co-chair, Ben Elliot. Johnson’s fellow Old Etonian, this maestro of favour-trading is now in charge of party money-making. Johnson’s majority of 80, the majority that slammed Brexit through – the Conservatives won it after record fundraising. Elliot has ramped up the Quintessentially model: pay your fees, join the club. Donate £250,000 and you get membership of the secret “advisory board”, pretty much unlimited access to anyone from Johnson down. “Ben has opened every chequebook across Mayfair,” a Tory source purrs in the press. “Boris acknowledges the important role he is playing.”

As well as Elliot, Amersi says he has discussed Comena with the member of the government who will host Amersi’s table: James Cleverly, the minister in the Foreign Office for the Middle East and North Africa. “They both expressed huge support!” Amersi said in his email to Conservative headquarters.

Amersi has placed Rodicheva to his left. To his right, Cleverly. Then, the ambassadors of the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Lebanon and Iraq. Envoys from the region so pivotal to British interests: supplier of oil, buyer of arms, gatherer of counter-terrorism intelligence.

The auction lots at the Winter Party are delectable. Whisky-tasting with Truss. Lunch with Zac Goldsmith. Dinner in Mayfair with Michael Gove, or at the Carlton Club with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who is in the meantime supposedly getting to grips with this new virus. Eighty grand gets you into a box at Lord’s to watch cricket with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. A game of tennis with Boris goes for £45,000.

And now Johnson draws near. He’s working the room. At Amersi’s table he shakes hands with the ambassadors. Then, in full view of the diplomatic corps, not to mention a cabinet member and whoever else in this estimable gathering may be watching, the prime minister singles out Amersi for a compliment.

The boy from Mombasa is where he feels he belongs. Here, in the elite. To get Comena going, there’s now just the formality of letting Charlotte Leslie, the ex-MP who’s doing Middle East stuff for Conservatives, know about Amersi’s vision. Once named backbencher of the year, she lost her seat in May’s 2017 snap election, and since then has run the Conservative Middle East Council, which has taken delegations of MPs to the region since 1980. A week after the Winter Party, a senior official at Conservative headquarters sends an email introducing Amersi to Leslie.

Amersi has breezed through the party’s vetting. Conservative officials email each other to say Amersi is what he says he is: “a well-connected worldwide man”. But Leslie does some Googling. She learns that Amersi has some Russia in his past. There’s a Forbes article from 2006 that mentions “a mysterious figure named Mohamed Amersi” doing telecoms deals in St Petersburg. Vladimir Putin’s minister of communications, Leonid Reiman, is quoted dismissing allegations that he, Reiman, is the secret beneficiary. Leslie reads that, from 2008 to 2013, Amersi was a senior adviser to TeliaSonera Group, a Scandinavian telecoms giant, and was involved in its controversial dealings in Nepal. Over Christmas, Leslie gathers what more she can find on Amersi into a memo. What really worries her is the gap between what she seems to be discovering about Amersi and his public image.

Around the end of 2020, Leslie sends her memo to some MPs, some diplomats, some intelligence people, and party elders – one of whom forwards it to the co-chair, Ben Elliot.

Months after Leslie’s memos raise questions about the sources of Amersi’s wealth, senior Tory officials are emailing staff at No 10 about the breakfast with Johnson that Amersi is still owed. “Can you do quite an in depth look into this?” writes one. “He’s a massive donor, just want to know if it’s likely to blow up into something if we do a breakfast.”

The Conservative Research Department does a check. “Nothing bad came back,” the senior party official assures the prime minister’s aide. Let’s get that breakfast sorted. Some swish hotel near Downing Street.

But before it can happen, news of Amersi’s fight with Leslie comes out. Amersi got hold of one of her memos. He repeatedly asked Elliot to get his Middle East role approved all the same. In one WhatsApp message, on 8 January 2021, Amersi said: “Shall we have a quick chat now or is that pushing you … if you want me to drop this, please say so to me! I am at least owed that! Friendships usually outlast positions in my humble experience … I know you hate confrontation. I hate it too! I didn’t start this mess. Charlotte Leslie did!”

“!!!. I am being bombarded,” Elliot replied. “I do not mind confrontation. Have a meeting with team next week on all this.”

“You take everyone’s call but mine!” Amersi wrote the same day. “Somebody who by Charlotte’s own admission has given the party £750k!” The figure includes the money that was declared as a donation from Rodicheva while Amersi was an impermissible donor. But this is not the topic to which the co-chair is addressing his energies.

“I know what to do. Do not need to be instructed,” Elliot wrote.

Amersi hires Nigel Tait, most formidable of the partners at the reputation-management law firm Carter-Ruck. Tait once remarked that he gets a buzz from suppressing free speech. Letter after letter after letter are sent to reporters and editors threatening legal proceedings of scarcely imaginable expense. That usually does the trick – the book, the article, the documentary will vanish from view. Should these muckrakers, these tittle-tattle merchants, these grubby hacks defy his clients, Tait will ensure that they spend months, years, in court. Funding this is no problem: his clients tend to possess inexhaustible quantities of money.

Tait writes to Leslie, saying she has spread toxic lies. She is, he says, conducting a campaign to do irreparable damage to Amersi’s reputation. Tait wants to know – pronto – how she intends to declare in public that she won’t stand in Amersi’s way. How she intends to help Amersi’s Middle East ambitions come to fruition.

If she refuses, Leslie could lose everything. Her job, her flat. She could be disgraced. “How dare she insult me?” Amersi once asked of Leslie. But she is defiant. She remembers her surfing days. They used to say that when the wave looks too big, too full of power, that’s when you must paddle towards it. Towards your fear.

When this fight between a party donor and a former Tory MP becomes public in mid-2021, Amersi says in an interview: “I would expect somebody senior from the party to at least have the decency to phone and say, ‘Look, Mohamed, I’m sorry that you’re having to face all of this. We stand behind you.’ They’d release a statement: ‘Mohamed Amersi is one of our loyal supporters. We have huge respect for him, and for all that he has done, not only for this party, but for so many academic institutions, charities.’” But Conservative headquarters is silent. After all those donations. After all those fees to Ben’s firm as an elite Quintessentially client – £15,000 year after year after year. Not a word of public support for this selfless thought leader.

In January 2022, David Davis, the veteran Conservative MP, uses a speech in the Commons to describe what he calls “an industry that hides evil in plain sight”. “There are those,” he says, “with exceptionally deep pockets and exceptionally questionable ethics [who] use our justice system to threaten, intimidate and put the fear of God into British journalists, citizens, officials and media organisations. What results is injustice, intimidation, suppression of free speech, the crushing of a free press, bullying and bankruptcy. It results in protection from investigation and gives encouragement to fraudsters, crooks and money launderers. It has turned London into the global capital of dirty money. In extreme cases, it can undermine the security of the state by allowing people to act as extensions of foreign powers.”

He describes a few cases. One involves a donor to his own party. “Amersi,” Davis tells the Commons, “has used his wealth and influence to try to bully [Charlotte] Leslie into silence.” Amersi writes to the speaker to complain, but no action is taken against Davis.

Even after Davis’s speech, the Conservative cause continues to profit from Amersi’s beneficence. The party has to refund £200,000 for the Johnson breakfast, Hunt sushi, and Mordaunt magic that never took place, and a year’s Leader’s Group subs. But at a lunchtime auction held by a Conservative organisation in May 2022, Amersi gives another £16,000 for the Thatcher Package (commemorative plate, autographed bottle of whisky, tea with two of the late Margaret’s colleagues) and dinner at a Green Park mansion with “four guests from the Westminster political scene”.

Labour calls on Johnson to sack his co-chair for the conflicts of interest between his political and commercial roles that the Amersi affair has exposed. The prime minister declines. A spokesperson for the party says that Elliot’s role at the party is “entirely separate from his other interests”. When Johnson himself goes, felled by one lie too many in a career of fabrication, Elliot (soon to be knighted in Johnson’s resignation honours) goes, too. He stands behind his old friend outside the door to No 10 as Boris gives a valedictory speech quoting a Roman dictator.

“Ben Elliott’s [sic] resignation as @Conservatives co-chair was long overdue,” tweets Amersi, whose fondness for Elliot evaporated when he didn’t get him what he wanted. The cleanup of Conservative headquarters that he has long advocated has begun. “But the rot doesn’t stop there. It goes deeper!” he added. Plus a prophecy: “Only when the cleanup is complete, the process of governing and delivery can begin. And this will be rewarded by more money, cleaner money!”

Amersi pursues Charlotte Leslie through the courts for three years until the court of appeal finally dismisses his defamation claim in 2023. Others receive threatening legal letters, too. And Amersi is suing the BBC, over a Panorama documentary examining his role – minimal and unwitting, he says – in a TeliaSonera telecoms deal that the company later admitted involved bribing an Uzbek dictator’s daughter. Carter-Ruck’s writ says: “The Claimant has an established reputation as an anti-corruption campaigner,” which the BBC has “seriously undermined and damaged”.

As for the Conservatives, it looks like their power is draining away. The polls suggest Labour will win the coming election. Should Labour candidates be in need of some help with campaign costs, a new source of funds has recently become available. In late 2023, Mohamed Amersi announced he would be happy to donate.

One senior official said the secretive 4,500-strong unit was the busiest it had been in at least a decade, and said the fast turnover of ministers made it harder to ensure key politicians were making informed decisions.

The official was asked if they agreed with Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, who said in a speech last month that the UK and the west was “moving from a postwar to a prewar world”.

The official, based in defence intelligence and speaking on condition of anonymity, cited Russia’s continuing attack on Ukraine and the possibility of an expansion of the conflict, while adding that it remained possible China would attempt to take Taiwan by force.

“Is there a likelihood of a large-scale conflict? Yes, there is. It’s probably more likely than it has been at any recent point,” they said, reflecting a period of instability deepened by the Israel-Gaza war and US-led bombing campaigns against Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iranian-back militias in Iran and Syria.

A particular challenge, they added, was dealing with “the turnover of decision makers” during years of Conservative turmoil. Three prime ministers, four foreign secretaries and two defence secretaries have served since late 2019, the course of the current parliament.

Senior officials and military leaders had a “responsibility to educate”, the senior defence official argued, recognising that politicians often came to defence and foreign policy roles with little experience of international or military affairs.

An exception is David Cameron, a former prime minister who was unexpectedly appointed last year by Rishi Sunak as foreign secretary. Shapps was given the job of defence secretary last September despite no experience of military affairs.

Defence Intelligence is not a statutory spy agency like MI5, MI6 and GCHQ but nevertheless forms a key part of Britain’s secret state, tasked with monitoring military threats, activity and conflict worldwide. Outside London, its principal operation is at RAF Wyton, in Cambridgeshire.

Dozens of teams operate at the base, aggregated into a newsroom the size of a football pitch in a building called Pathfinder. Monitoring desks displaying maps, satellite imagery, drone footage or other feeds from conflict zones or other regions are arranged in honeycomb banks to allow for team working.

The complex range of activities include using remote imagery to identifying potential Houthi missile and radar sites, which have been bombed three times by the US and UK since mid-January. Identical tools are used to conduct damage assessment and assess casualties from a distance.

In keeping with Five Eyes practice, all raw intelligence is shared with the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and officials from all countries operate inside Pathfinder. Monitoring activities follow the sun, with the newsroom handing over to the US in the evening and picking up from New Zealand in the morning.

One team, DI Watch, operates on a 24-hour basis, tasked with continually monitoring reports of violence or conflict. If thought necessary, a cross-government alert should be produced within 10 minutes and a slide with context and a graphic, similar to the US Discord leaks, distributed within an hour.

An open source intelligence team relies on satellite imagery to monitor developments in military installations in Russia, China and elsewhere. Last month, some of its work was sent to a panel of UN experts showing satellite photos of North Korean cargo shipments to Russia, said to be weapons.

Another group specialises in mapping locations using drones and lasers, and regularly assists British police. Its 3D visualisations help officers provide security for large events in the UK, while the drone team to helped discover footprints left by the killer of the Hull student Libby Squire as he dumped her body in a river.

A capability assessments team monitors weapons developed by adversaries. Its recent work has included an examination of the DF-27, a Chinese hypersonic missile that emerged in 2022. It has a range of about 3,100 miles (5,000km) and can travel more than five times the speed of sound, making it difficult to shoot down soon after launch.

A second defence official emphasised that Beijing was still considered the longer-term threat because of its size and technological capability, despite the series of current conflicts. They said there were “storms in the Middle East and a hurricane in Ukraine but China is climate change”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Massimiliano Melargo, 27, told how he was detained overnight, separated from his Ukrainian partner, and put on the first plane to Venice by Border Force officials in a step lawyers say contravenes the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK.

“I don’t feel great because I am away from my girlfriend, I have lost my job and I’m going to lose the deposit on my flat,” said Melargo.

He had left the country for a birthday holiday break in Finland and was originally told he would be removed to Helsinki when he was stopped at Gatwick.

He said he feared he could not come back to pick up his belongings or to visit his girlfriend of five years, or his sister, who has been in the country for 12 years.

“I feel that even If I go there to visit I will have problems. It’s very disappointing. It’s going to be difficult to come back even as a tourist,” he said.

“My detention and then removal is causing me and my partner immense distress and hardship.

“I am a law-abiding, upstanding good citizen, certainly not deserving of the treatment I was given by being detained and treated like a delinquent and removed. I am contributing fully to the country’s economy and society,” he added.

Melargo had lived in the UK before Brexit and had made a late application to remain in the country using the Brexit EU settlement scheme set up for the millions of EU citizens living in the country before the UK withdrew from the bloc in 2021.

The hospitality worker had left the country before Brexit and intended to return before the end of 2020 to secure his rights, but was unable to because of lockdowns and Covid-related travel bans.

He returned to the UK after Brexit and submitted a late application for the EU settlement scheme in January 2023. This was rejected but he immediate appealed.

He said he believed he was “unlawfully removed” because the Home Office Certification of Application (CoA), which notifies a future employer or landlord of a person’s right to work and rent property while awaiting a decision, states he can travel.

It says: “Your certificate of application allows you to travel in and out of the UK pending a final decision on your application, including during any appeal.”

Confusingly, it also advises against travel in and out of the country, and on a previous occasion when Merlago returned from holiday he was not stopped.

It appears the border officials relied on a paragraph in the CoA which states that someone “may also be asked for evidence to show that you were resident in the UK by 31 December 2020”, such as a national insurance or HMRC record.

Luke Piper, a lawyer with the Work Rights Centre and an EU settlement scheme specialist, said the rights of EU citizens were guaranteed under the withdrawal agreement, including during an application process.

“The Home Office appears to be overstepping its powers and allowing Border Force to pre-judge the case before the appeal has been concluded. These appeals should be reviewed, processed and concluded before there can be a decision on entry to the country by Border Force.

“What happens at the border appears to be down to the officer who sees you on the day. The whole point of the certificate of application is to demonstrate that you are in an application process that has not been concluded. Confusingly it tells recipients they can travel but also says they shouldn’t. It’s Kafkaesque.”

In response, the Home Office suggested it was key for all those travelling with a CoA to also carry proof of living in the country before Brexit.

Shadow cabinet ministers have been given until 8 February to make policy submissions for the manifesto, as Keir Starmer’s party gears up for an election that, according to opinion polls, looks likely to return it to government for the first time since 2010.

A committee of shadow ministers and officials will then assess which commitments will require legislation in a king’s speech that will be delivered within weeks of entering office.

The party intends to have both documents ready by mid-March, in case Rishi Sunak calls an early spring poll.

The Observer understands that as well as backing away from its £28bn a year commitment on green investment (while sticking to the overall drive to achieve clean energy by 2030), Labour will not seek to legislate on the creation of a new national care service in its first king’s speech.

Instead, it will focus on a fair pay agreement for care workers as well as issues of recruitment and retention, as part of a wider workers’ rights bill. Its plans for a complete overhaul of social care will, however, be presented as a longer-term mission taking at least 10 years and two parliaments.

In addition, despite Keir Starmer’s previous promises to abolish the Lords in a first term, it is expected to commit only to limited changes. This is likely to mean legislating only for the abolition of the remaining 91 hereditary peers.

Labour’s cautious approach – which is frustrating some MPs and party members – is partly the result of uncertainty about the economic situation it will inherit and what can be afforded.

But shadow ministers are also determined to offer as small a target as possible to the Tories on issues such as social care, which in the past have turned election campaigns upside down. In 2010, Labour’s care plans were branded a “death tax” by the Conservatives, and hit the party’s vote badly, while in 2017 Theresa May’s campaign suffered irreparable damage amid accusations she was planning a “dementia tax”.

On social care, Starmer’s party has rallied the unions behind its more gradual approach. Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, told the Observer: “Care is in crisis and the need for a national service has never been greater. But the sector is complex and, with many thousands of care employers, creating a new system isn’t a five-minute job.

“In stark contrast to the litany of broken promises from this government, Labour is committed to reforming care. Under the proposed fair pay agreement, wages will rise and care workers earn the same no matter where they work in England.

“Care jobs will immediately become more attractive, and the sector be able to start filling the huge hole in its workforce. That will boost support to everyone needing care and begin to lift the pressure on the NHS.”

With its green prosperity plan now being talked down, Labour’s new “flagship” policy is increasingly seen as its new deal for working people, which involves handing workers new rights from their first day of employment, as well as the abolition of zero-hours contracts. The deal, fiercely guarded by deputy leader Angela Rayner, also includes a ban on “firing and rehiring”.

Another bill that is likely to be prioritised will be a “fiscal lock” that will force government to submit all tax and spending plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility for its judgment before pressing ahead.

The aim is to contrast Labour’s commitment to fiscal discipline with the disastrous decision-making of the Liz Truss government, which caused near panic on financial markets.

Elsewhere, Labour’s pledge to roll out breakfast clubs to every primary school in England, funded by the abolition of non-dom tax status, remains prominent in the manifesto.

There are also hopes internally that a big childcare pledge could form part of Labour’s programme in a first term, with the party keen on expanding the number of nurseries attached to primary schools to tackle a huge shortage of places and staff. The former Ofsted head, Sir David Bell, is studying the issue for Labour, but is unlikely to report in time for an election before the autumn.

The party’s pledge to raise more tax from private equity managers has also come in for scrutiny. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has vowed to raise the amount charged on profits they earn on deals, to match the 45p top rate of income tax. However, some in the party are said to be keen to water down the plan, fearful of deterring investment and denting Labour’s pledge to make the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7 group of developed countries. Party sources insisted the plan remained to tax such profits as income.

The manifesto will also make much of a pledge to build 300,000 homes a year – a target in the last Conservative manifesto that has not been achieved. Starmer’s willingness to take on those who want to prevent any building on “greenfield” sites is used by Labour insiders to show the Labour leader is willing to take on potentially difficult battles, rather than always take a cautious path.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

In a move that prompted an angry response from environmental groups, unions and some in the energy sector, Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, jointly announced they would slash the green prosperity plan from £28bn a year to under £15bn – only a third of which would be new money.

It ended a protracted internal battle within Labour over the policy, with some senior officials urging Starmer to stick to his green commitments and others warning it would be an electoral liability.

While intended to shield against repeated Conservative attacks on the scale of borrowing required, the climbdown infuriated environmental campaigners, who said it would push up costs in the long term and make it harder for Labour to reach ambitious green targets.

The Unite union said Labour risked “outsourcing their policymaking to the Conservatives”, while the energy industry’s trade group said it was concerned about the reduced ambition for “the future of our sector in the UK”.

Speaking to reporters in Westminster, Starmer said: “We will not reach the £28bn – the £28bn, therefore, is stood down and we focus on the outcomes. We want to get to that place because at the moment all you are ever asked about is the size of the cheque and we want to have an argument about the outcomes, which is what matters.”

He added: “We announced the £28bn two and a half years or so ago, when interest rates were very, very low. Since then, Liz Truss crashed the economy and other damage has been done. [Interest rates] are now very, very high – interest on government debt is already tens of billions of pounds a year.

“We’ve always said we have to be within the fiscal rules and fiscal rules come first.”

Labour announced the £28bn spending plan in 2021, as Reeves promised to be the UK’s “first green chancellor”. She said at the time the money would be spent on battery manufacturing, hydrogen power, offshore wind, tree planting, flood defences and home insulation.

Since then the party has come under increasing attack over the plan, as Starmer and Reeves struggled to explain how they could stick to the spending commitment and keep a separate promise to cut government debt levels in the long term.

The Guardian revealed last week that Starmer had decided to scale back the plan after lengthy internal discussion and heavy lobbying from aides, such as Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s campaign chief, who said sticking to it would be an electoral liability.

Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, had pushed back against diluting the plan. There was even speculation, denied by his team, that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming the U-turn.

Starmer had continued to cite the £28bn target as recently as Tuesday, telling Times Radio it was “desperately needed” for the party’s mission of achieving clean power by 2030.

On Thursday, he told reporters he no longer believed this was needed. Instead, Labour would spend just over £4.7bn a year, on top of £10bn of green schemes it says the government has already committed to.

About half of that money would come from changes to the government’s oil and gas windfall tax, with Labour planning to raise the rate from 75% to 78% and extend it until the end of the parliament. The other half would come from new borrowing.

The biggest cuts have been to the party’s home insulation scheme. Labour had previously promised to spend up to £6bn a year insulating 19m homes over a decade.

Under the revised plans Starmer and Reeves intend to spend just £6.6bn over the parliament – an average of £1.3bn a year.

The cuts will mean the party reducing its targets for the number of properties it can insulate. Starmer said Labour now intended to insulate 5m homes over the first five years of government, and that it would take as long as 14 years to reach the 19m target.

Other schemes, including a £7.3bn national wealth fund and an £8.3bn national energy supplier called Great British Energy, will remain, in an effort to meet the clean power pledge.

Reeves said: “Something had to give if we were going to be within our fiscal rules and to achieve clean power by 2030. We have got to get on with the national wealth fund and GB Energy, and so we have scaled back our ambition on warm homes.”

Labour’s U-turn dismayed many green campaigners, who said their energy targets would be difficult to hit without the promised level of spending.

Areeba Hamid, the co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said Starmer had “caved like a house of cards in the wind”.

Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said Labour had “turned its back on the people who most urgently need these essential upgrades – the many millions of low-income households suffering from living in poorly insulated homes”.

Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, said the issue was less the actual sum spent than “the signal it sends”. She said: “The party has been engaging constructively with business over recent months, but retaining the confidence of the market is dependent on not making U-turns that damage the UK’s investability.”

A number of Labour MPs simply expressed relief that the policy had been decided. One shadow cabinet minister said: “The policy is the main thing. To put a number on it was always a hostage to fortune with a flatlining economy and a government spending all that it has.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Three patients at Forston clinic, an NHS mental health inpatient service near Dorchester, were told to attend meetings or risk their benefits being cut in recent months – sparking complaints from the local Citizens Advice branch, which has an adviser based at the clinic.

Despite appearing to contradict national guidance from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), local jobcentre managers have refused requests from Citizens Advice Central Dorset to guarantee that no further demands of mental health inpatients will be made.

“It’s just ridiculous. It’s beyond ridiculous,” Daphne Hall, south-west England representative at the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers (Nawra), told the Observer. “There should be no way somebody in hospital for whatever reason – mental health or physical – should be expected to attend a work-related appointment. They’re in hospital. They can’t possibly do that.”

Last week employment minister Jo Churchill clarified that DWP guidance did not require hospital inpatients to attend jobcentre meetings, in response to a parliamentary question from Stephen Timms, chair of the work and pensions committee.

“Anybody in those particular units, which are for seriously mentally ill people, should not be required to engage in any kind of work search, work preparation, work-related ­activities – they should be completely ­outside of that,” said Caroline Buxton, business and partnerships manager at Central Advice Central Dorset.

“Surely the fact that he’s sectioned is enough to know this person is not at a stage in their claimant journey when they could come and discuss ‘Should I do an IT course?’ or whatever. This is just totally inappropriate.”

Two of the patients did not have to attend after Citizens Advice intervened, while staff at the clinic decided to send a third patient to a jobcentre, so as not to delay their universal credit claim.

“If [the meetings] didn’t go ahead, that was because we have some funding for a dedicated Citizens Advice adviser, able to be in that unit, picking up the phone or emailing somebody and saying: ‘Hey, what are you doing this for? Why are you asking this person to come?’” said Buxton.

Universal credit claimants who are out of work and not judged to be severely disabled are generally required to look for work and attend face-to-face meetings otherwise they are “sanctioned” for a period of time and their benefits cut.

But national DWP guidance on work-related requirements lists “mental health issues (eg low self-confidence and self-esteem, anxiety state or depression)” as a “complex need” that means “it would be unreasonable to expect [claimants] to meet their current work-related requirements”.

“Putting any sort of pressure on somebody who’s going through a mental health crisis is likely to be extremely detrimental to their health,” Nawra’s Hall told the Observer.

A DWP spokesperson said: “There are no references within our guidance which state we would require a hospital inpatient to attend a meeting at a jobcentre.

“Work coaches have the discretion to personalise the work-related requirements for individual claimants based on the impact of their health condition.

After the exchanges, at prime minister’s questions, Brianna’s father, Peter Spooner, called Sunak’s comments “absolutely dehumanising”.

“For the prime minister of our country to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in parliament, they are absolutely dehumanising,” he told Sky News. “Identities of people should not be used in that manner, and I personally feel shocked by his comments and feel he should apologise for his remarks.”

A series of Conservative MPs also rounded on Sunak for insensitivity after he pressed ahead with an apparently prepared attack line about transgender people, just after being told by Keir Starmer that Esther Ghey was in the public gallery.

Listing what he called broken Labour promises, the prime minister said: “I think I counted almost 30 in the last year: pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn.”

The final example, seemingly a reference to a Labour policy reversal on self-identification and Starmer’s comment that “99.9%” of women do not have penises, prompted a furious response from several MPs.

A clearly angry Starmer replied: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in the chamber. Shame. Parading as a man of integrity, when he’s got absolutely no responsibility.”

Sunak ignored several demands from MPs in the Commons that he apologise, saying only that Esther Ghey represented “the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity, and she deserves all our admiration and praise.”

No 10 defended his words, saying it was “legitimate” to note U-turns by the opposition.

It is understood that while Sunak made the comments after being told that Ghey was watching, she actually arrived in chamber slightly late and so missed that initial exchange.

00:01:27 Starmer condemns Sunak comment on trans people as Brianna Ghey's mother watches in gallery – video

Brianna, 16, was lured to a park in Cheshire and murdered in February last year. Last Friday, Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, were jailed for at least 22 and 20 years respectively. Ratcliffe was found to have been partly motivated by hostility to Brianna’s transgender identity.

It emerged later that No 10 was trying to arrange a meeting between Sunak and Brianna’s family, at a time to suit them, to discuss online safety among young people, one of several issues that have come to the fore from her murder.

While some colleagues leapt to Sunak’s defence – the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, tweeted that it was “shameful of Starmer to link his own inability to be clear on the matter of sex and gender directly to her grief” – several Tory MPs expressed disquiet.

The former minister Jackie Doyle-Price said that while she was an advocate of balancing transgender rights with the protection of single-sex spaces, Sunak’s comment “trivialises something that’s very important” and was “frankly very ill-judged”.

She told Times Radio: “I suspect that when he says that line, he doesn’t think about it like that because it’s being given to him as a line. Let’s just bring it down to its lowest level – you know, boys like talking about penises.”

Dehenna Davison, another former minister, tweeted that it was “disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community’s expense”, adding: “Our words in the house resonate right across our society and we all need to remember that.”

She wrote: “Given some of the terrible incidences of transphobia we have seen lately, this need for respect feels more crucial than ever.”

View image in fullscreen Brianna Ghey, 16, was murdered by two teenagers last year, at least one of whom was found to have been partly motivated by her transgender identity.

Jamie Wallis, the Conservative backbencher who in 2022 became the UK’s first publicly trans MP, also expressed disappointment at Sunak’s words.

He said in a statement: “I know that from my own interactions with the prime minister that today’s display of insensitivity must have been inadvertent. Today has been a tough day for me, but all I can think about right now is Brianna’s mother. Let us all think of her as we choose how to progress with this debate.”

While Downing Street clearly hopes the row will die down, it has the potential to create more difficulties, with the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, enduring some awkward exchanges in TV interviews intended to be devoted to a Treasury analysis of Labour’s green prosperity plan.

Asked repeatedly why Sunak had made a joke at the expense of trans people, the chancellor told the BBC this was “taking these comments out of context”, before eventually refusing to engage with questions about whether the prime minister should apologise.

A Labour spokesperson said: “We don’t think that the country wants or deserves a prime minister that is happy to use minorities as a punchbag. The comments were really deeply offensive to trans people and he should reflect on his response there and apologise.”

Starmer held a meeting with Esther Ghey in parliament after PMQs. He later tweeted: “I am utterly in awe of her strength and bravery in the face of such unimaginable grief, as she campaigns to make sure no parent has to go through what she did.”

Sunak and his ministers routinely attack Labour’s position on transgender rights. Last year the party changed its policy on a self-identification system that would have let people officially change their gender without a medical diagnosis.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Among the top achievements listed were booming sales of honey to Saudi Arabia, surging pet food exports to India, a rush of UK pork, worth £18m over five years, heading into Mexico’s restaurants and homes, and UK beauty products sales leaping in China, thanks to barriers being smashed.

“My department is leveraging our post-Brexit freedoms to make the UK the best place in the world to start and grow a business,” added Badenoch, seen by many Tory MPs as one of several flexing their muscles for a tilt at the leadership quite soon.

But her triumphalist tone, and many of the assertions in the Department for Business and Trade’s (DBT) Brexit 4th Anniversary document, did not quite ring true with the industries cited.

“I don’t know any of our members who export any great amounts [to Saudi Arabia],” said Paul Barton of the Bee Farmers Association, which represents professional beekeepers in the UK.

“Speaking from the industry, we’ve not had any assistance from the government in exploiting [the Saudi Arabian] market, getting access into that market. So I don’t know where their increases come from.”

He added: “I do remember years ago a chap, I think he was Kuwaiti or Saudi, just knocked on the door and bought a couple of buckets full of honey. I imagine he put it in his hand luggage.”

People in the UK honey business seem focused on other issues. Of all the honey that is consumed in the UK, it is a worry that less than 10% is produced here, Barton said, with cheap Chinese imports making up the stiffest competition.

As far as Brexit is concerned, a big issue is not so much exporting the end product to Saudi or anywhere else but importing queen bees, and on that, Brexit is proving more of a problem than a help.

Queens are reared in southern European countries and brought to the UK so that farmers can begin their hives earlier in the season. But Brexit red tape means the bees are now subject to expensive and disruptive veterinary checks.

As for the government’s claim that “a barrier resolution worth £550m to UK businesses over five years” has helped British beauty companies export to China, the barrier in question had nothing to do with Brexit, according to industry experts. In 2021, China relaxed rules on animal testing, which had been a big red line for UK manufacturers, making it easier to sell into their market.

Millie Kendall, chair of the British Beauty Council, said the loss of trade with the EU outweighed the gains by a long way. “What we really want is to sell to Europe and the US. Economically, we’ve lost £853m in exports to the EU. Sixty-five per cent of our exports go to Europe – £550m sounds nice but it’s not even what we’ve lost.”

One of Kendall’s members sent some products to Spain in August and they have still not arrived. Another, larger company has had to build a £1m warehouse in the EU simply to be able to distribute products. Most smaller companies have just given up, she said.

For larger sectors, Badenoch’s triumphs seemed trivial, experts said. The business secretary’s announcement said officials had unlocked £25m of exports for medicines and £17m of new business in Colombia.

“Together, these amounts represent less than 1% of the total value of the UK pharmaceutical exports of goods in 2022,” said Dr Jennifer Castañeda-Navarrete, a senior policy analyst at Cambridge Industrial Innovation Policy, based at Cambridge University’s Institute for Manufacturing.

In 2022, 46% of pharmaceutical exports went to the EU. She warned that Britain’s previously thriving pharmaceutical sector was now in a trade deficit because we have to import so much more medicine than before – the latest 2022 figures show a $5bn deficit globally, compared with a surplus of $9.7bn in 2010.

A business department spokesperson said: “Many, including the Observer, forecast dire predictions for the UK economy after Brexit. As this document shows, those forecasts have been proven completely false. Of course there have been issues, nobody ever said it will all be perfect.

“However, the report uses official statistics and many of the things people claim are down to Brexit are really down to Covid and supply chain issues. This report is intended as a useful corrective to the consistent doom and gloom about Brexit.”

But the business department’s press release makes no mention of the problems suffered by small UK companies, which have seen their export markets hit and in many cases wiped out. In 2022, researchers at Aston University estimated that 42% of British products previously exported to the EU had disappeared from shops there.

While large companies have been able to spend money on warehouses, vets, distributors, customs clearance, extra shipping costs and all the other red tape that arrived with Brexit, smaller ones have not.

Thomas Sampson, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, said the top 15% of companies had not seen a drop in exports to the EU, but for smaller businesses, there had been a 20% fall.

“It’s great that the DBT are working on removing market access barriers. But it’s all a little bit marginal relative to the seismic shock of leaving the single market and customs union,” Sampson said. “The big gains in the next five years will come by focusing on what’s happening with the EU and trying to simplify our relationship.”

David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, said that the government’s fourth anniversary of Brexit document was “the usual set of claims that are in various ways slightly distorted”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The UK should also expand its air and naval presence in Northern Ireland, to counter a growing Russian threat on the UK’s western flank, according to the Policy Exchange report, which is backed by two former defence secretaries, Michael Fallon and George Robertson.

The UK and Ireland are at risk from an “acute maritime menace” posed by a Russian doctrine of targeting undersea networks and pipelines and the presence of Russian warships, they say in a foreword to the paper.

Concerns about Russian intelligence operations in Ireland and its vulnerability to cyber-attack are also highlighted in the report, which cites what it describes as an “inordinately large Russian diplomatic outfit in Dublin”.

The embassy had 30 members of staff in 2022, which was more than many other European states with which Russia had closer ties at the time.

Other evidence cited included Russian attempts to expand the embassy significantly, a move blocked in 2020 when the Irish government revoked planning permission on the grounds it was “likely to be harmful to the security and defence of the state”.

China is another significant concern due to its rapid technological advancements and global influence.

Meanwhile Ken McCallum, the director general of MI5, has said Iran stands out as the state that “most frequently crosses into terrorism”. UK authorities uncovered at least 10 potential threats last year related to kidnapping or harming UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime.

It was an “unavoidable fact” that Ireland had “freeloaded” off the investment of others who were part of Nato, said the report, which added that this “home truth” had been admitted last year by the then taoiseach, Micheál Martin, as a discussion about Irish neutrality deepened.

Discussions about neutrality among Ireland’s political classes have sharpened in the era of Russian aggression under Vladimir Putin, the arrival of Ukrainian refugees, incursions by Russian ships that are suspected of mapping underwater cables, and a 2021 ransomware attack by suspected Russian gangs on the health service.

Ireland’s president has rebuked the government for launching a debate about the country’s longstanding military neutrality and the possibility of joining Nato, saying ministers were “playing with fire”.

The report tried to sound an alarm bell about the consequences of Sinn Féin winning Irish elections in 2025.

“If Sinn Féin wins in 2025, the UK is therefore looking at many more years of an uncooperative, and likely hostile, neighbour in the face of growing external threats,” it said. While Sinn Féin had been on the rise in the Republic and now holds the post of first minister in Northern Ireland, it has slumped in polls south of the border.

Fallon and Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, welcomed the fact that Ireland had been reviewing its defence outlook – as Sweden and Finland have also moved away from neutrality – and called on the UK to encourage its neighbour to strengthen defences and build on a UK-Ireland defence agreement signed in 2015.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Yet even as the sun beamed down, the shadow of one absent figure seemed to hang over proceedings.

There was a jubilant mood at the South Yorkshire gathering as they cheered leader Richard Tice’s demands for an inquiry into vaccine harms, to break with the World Health Organization and to fire headteachers who refused to drop “critical race theory”.

Even from the conference stage, however, it was acknowledged there was one big unanswered question. David White, the Barnsley South ­candidate, admitted he is regularly asked: “When’s Nigel coming back?”

The leaders of Reform UK, which grew out of the Brexit party after the last election, are in optimistic mood after seizing 13% of the vote at the Wellingborough byelection, its best ever result. They believe it confirms national polling that suggests about one in 10 voters may back them.

Yet despite the progress, many Reform supporters – and concerned Tory MPs – feel that the addition of Nigel Farage could turn the party from a minor irritant to the Conservatives into an existential threat.

“I would hope he would come back,” said Stephen O’Neill, who had travelled with his wife, Sandra, from Glasgow. “I don’t think he’d be leader, but obviously Farage has got the ­charisma and the notoriety.” Sandra adds: “It needs publicity; that’s what they don’t get.”

Charlotte, from Gloucestershire, attracted to Reform because of a ­dislike of the main parties, was also keen for a Farage return. “I’d ­certainly like to see him,” she said. “He’s good at his job and getting the crowds together. He can give all the other leaders a good run for their money.”

Even among attendees at the conference, however, there was an acknowledgment that the addition of Farage could be double-edged.

“He’s a polarising character, but that’s because the media portray him as that,” said Colin, an ex-Tory voter from Lincolnshire who said his former party doesn’t represent his views any longer. “I would like him to come back and help Reform, but not necessarily stand as a candidate. The mainstream media would circle like vultures to destroy him.”

The policy platform announced in Doncaster is huge, from ending inheritance tax to replenishing the fishing fleet. Yet Tories on the right, sympathetic to many of the ideas, believe Farage is vital if Reform’s insurgency is to be significant.

“He’s the only one with any political nous,” said one former minister. He pointed to issues that seem too technical and remote, such as Northern Ireland’s Brexit mechanisms or the interest on quantitative easing reserves given to commercial banks.

Exclusive polling for the Observer by Opinium sheds more light on the Farage factor. Reform UK has 10% support, the level it has recorded for some time, and similar to the share of votes in the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections that its leaders hailed as a breakthrough. The ­poll also suggests the return of Farage would make the party a bigger draw, even if the first past the post system means seizing a seat looks unlikely.

Tice has a net approval rating of -9, not bad in comparison with other leaders, but most voters do not have an opinion at all and he is still largely unknown outside his party. Farage is on -19% among voters as a whole, but most have a view of him. Among Tory voters still backing the party, 39% approve of Farage, suggesting Reform could do serious damage to Rishi Sunak should Farage take the helm. Of current Tory voters, 42% said Farage’s return would make them more favourable towards Reform.

It all leaves Farage with a dilemma. Should he once again return to fight a general election, which has seen him disappointed so many times before? Or should he, as he didrecently, spend his time on the money-­spinning media circuit in the US, commentating on his old ally Donald Trump’s campaign for the White House? The latter option also leaves open the bigger prize of joining a Tory party in search of leadership should it suffer a heavy general election loss. Farage remains tight-lipped.

The other issue for Reform is that there is also a split among those on the right who believe the Tory party is headed in the wrong direction. While some have opted for a fresh start with Reform, others want to stay within the Tory tent and pull it further right. This is the tactic being pursued by several MPs and former Tory donors.

To this group, Reform’s ­increasing support is the evidence they need to push Sunak in their direction. “I hear from constituents that they want the Conservative government to be more Conservative,” said one senior figure on the right. “They resent the drift in society. It’s a kind of modernism that they don’t like. They don’t like some of the characteristics of modern Britain, the atomisation of Britain and decline of traditional structures. That’s what they hate most and they think the government should do something about it. The Tory party just needs to be more Tory. Stop parroting the liberal left bollocks.”

Sunak’s team claim to be relaxed about Reform’s recent performances, even though it was achieved ­without Farage. “The one thing that ­surprised us in Wellingborough was that Reform didn’t do as well as we thought they might,” said one source. “I remember when you got Ukip getting 60% in Clacton in 2014. And it’s very clear now that a vote for Reform is essentially a vote for Keir Starmer, so those votes could come back to us [at a general election].”

As for the increasingly miserable liberal wing of the Tory party, they believe there is a confected element to the concerns expressed about the Reform threat. “These are not ­people panicking,” said one former cabinet minister. “These are people who want to turn the Tory party into Reform or some version of it, and are seizing on opportunities to do so. Anyone sensible recognises that you cannot simply add the Reform vote to the Tory vote and say, ‘look, it’s a new coalition’. You shed voters on the other side.

“People who say that this is evidence to show we should leave the European convention on human rights and start campaigning on that are being, I think the parliamentary word is, disingenuous.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

It suits Cameron's tabloid-slick delivery and Steve Hilton's blue-sky viciousness, but how did it go viral? Why does Ed Miliband now use ""striver"" as though it were an acceptable way to describe someone, by a stranger's groundless estimation of how hard they are hypothetically trying? The skiver, in opposition parlance, is always unmentioned, yet he lurks; Labour won't tolerate him either, this feckless bogeyman of Westminster's devising. But how did this false dichotomy, which has been at the heart of the rhetoric around the government's attack on benefits this week, catch on?

Don't tell me it is because it rhymes. It will destroy my faith in humanity, and that's exactly what they want. But the point is not that politicians spout it, nor that people who haven't given it any thought believe it. The point is that it has seeped so far, so fast, into the national consciousness as a meaningful idea that the very people vilified by it – the people who know they are unemployed by circumstance and not by choice – feel their lives judged against its fictional benchmarks.

Sarah Teather, who on Tuesday was one of the pitifully few (four) Lib Dems voting against the welfare bill, described the so-called ""skivers"" she encounters in her constituency office: ""People who come to my constituency office these days for help with some kind of error in their benefits often spend the first few minutes trying to justify their worth. They usually begin by trying to explain their history of working and that they have paid tax. They are desperate to get over the point that they are not like other benefit claimants – they are not a scrounger. It is perhaps a feature of the way in which the term 'scroungers' has become so pervasive in social consciousness that even those on benefits do not attempt to debunk the entire category, only to excuse themselves from the label.""

How did this come about? First, before we even arrived at the rhyming words, reducing every crappy policy to the simplicity of a limerick, there was a concerted effort to recast ""social security"" as ""welfare"". Nobody described this more elegantly than Baroness Hollis, in a debate in the Lords in 2011: ""Until recently, when we introduced a bill like this it would not have been a welfare reform bill, it would have been a social security bill. The gap between social security and welfare is precisely the gap between entitlement and stigma.""

People sometimes ascribe this adoption of ""welfare"" as an Americanism, designed to convey some of the US's sneering synecdoche where the name of the government support becomes shorthand for the person being supported. I think it's also an attempt to dehumanise people on state benefits – we never used to talk about welfare in terms of humans, but the word has been in everyday UK usage, for as long as I can remember, to describe animals. To be in receipt of state benefits thus tacitly becomes a passive, piteous, dumb thing to do. You don't necessarily begrudge the animals their welfare, but you wouldn't mistake yourself for one of them.

On its own, this wouldn't be enough, since even to a government that often seems scarcely able to count, it would have been obvious that almost all of us were on some benefit or other. Even the main benefits, the ones they speak of as cripplingly expensive, haven't for a long time been limited to the unemployed – 93% of new housing benefit claims are from people who have a job. This statistic says such a lot – about the structure of this economy, the disparity between wages and rents, the state of the housing market, the awe-inspiring integrity and energy of people who go to work even for a job that doesn't cover their rent, the contrast between them and politicians who won't pay their own rent even though they can afford it. It says almost everything good and everything bad about this country, that statistic. I'd get it as a tattoo, only I'm hoping that one day it will no longer be true.

So it takes more than a change in terminology to demonise the recipients of social security. You also need to create a distinction between the ones you approve of, and the ones you don't. The most vivid example of what happens when you don't is Mitt Romney's ill-fated castigation of the ""takers"" of society, the people who don't pay tax. When it transpired that this was 47% of the US population, he inadvertently created a previously nonexistent solidarity among those he set out to attack. There is no failsafe formula for how large a scapegoat class can be, but it's safe to say it has to be quite a bit smaller than ""nearly half of everybody"".

I personally think that Iain Duncan Smith has been the most industrious MP at building a pariah class – benefit recipients who love benefits, who scoff at your idiocy in paying for them, who hate work like the devil and love the devil almost as much as their 57in TVs. Much of it is rhetorical flourish – ""generations of worklessness"" has a good, congenital ring, with its suggestion that some people are simply born worse than others – but more is deliberate misinformation.

The number of households with two generations who have never worked is 1% – no, not of all households, dummkopf! – 1% of unemployed households. Figures don't exist for households where there are three generations of worklessness, so we would be as well to assume there are none as to think they're out there, gathered in the pub as we speak, mocking us. The talk of ""troubled families"" last year – in which 120,000 persistently anti-social families were identified, only for it to emerge later that the figures were actually a measure of deprivation, not behaviour – achieved the same outcome.

They conjured up for us a layer of people who are not simply different, but worse – people whom an honest striver would never meet, because their activities are so few, their social tendrils limited to picking up their benefits and maybe popping out offspring. From here, the taint of dishonesty was relatively easy to introduce; a person too lazy to work would most likely have built up strategies for the avoidance thereof, some of which must have been dishonest. The word ""cheat"" now fits so snugly against the word ""benefits"" that they run together as a single concept. If the people exist who claim benefits but don't cheat, surely it's only a matter of time.

Taken all together, this represents misinformation on a massive scale, spoken and unspoken, implied and inferred, leading to misconceptions of equally daunting proportions. A survey released by the TUC last week found that, on average, people thought 41% of the entire welfare budget went to unemployed people, when, in fact, it's 3%. Much more alarming, I think, is the averagely held view that 27% of the welfare budget is claimed fraudulently, when, according to this survey, the true figure is 0.7%. More recent stats from the Department for Work and Pensions put it at 0.3%. Of those surveyed, 79% thought a family with two school-age children would be better off on benefits than if one parent got a minimum-wage job – in fact, with one parent in work, that hypothetical family would be £138 better off a week. We have one of the least generous unemployment benefit systems in Europe, and it gets meaner every year. But that isn't really the point. There are very profound points of disagreement looming over this terrain. If you want to make sure ""work pays"", wouldn't it be better to force up wages than force down benefits? If you want to increase the money available to the public purse, wouldn't it be better to make sure people keep their jobs, than penalise and denigrate the unemployed, who don't have any money anyway and can only pay you in shame?

In a way, it is precisely to avoid those questions that this false war has been created. Every minute spent discussing the factual inaccuracies, dishonesty and sleight of hand in the skivers/strivers debate is time wasted, time that could be spent addressing the bone-rattling mismanagement of an economy that only doesn't look more dangerous because it is going so slowly. And yet, we have to discuss it; to leave it unaddressed is to accept that public life has been polluted, that we now live in a system where it doesn't matter what's true, it only matters what's been said most often. To borrow, for solace, from Churchill: statistically speaking, the unemployed won't always be unemployed. A Tory will always be a Tory.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The Ukip leader indicated that he would prefer immigration from countries he said had the most similar cultures to the UK as he was grilled about his approach to immigration during the latest BBC Leader interview broadcast on Wednesday evening.

Asked by presenter Evan Davis whether he would favour immigrants from some countries over others, he said: “I have to confess I do have a slight preference. I do think, naturally, that people from India and Australia are in some ways more likely to speak English, understand common law and have a connection with this country than some people that come perhaps from countries that haven’t fully recovered from being behind the iron curtain.”

In the past, Farage has always claimed to be the only party leader with a “non-discriminatory” policy on immigration as Ukip would not give preference to EU migrants over those from the rest of the world. Last year, he told LBC: “I actually want us to have an immigration policy that is non-discriminatory, because at the moment we discriminate in favour of people from Poland, or Romania, or Bulgaria, regardless [of] who they are, and we discriminate against people from New Zealand … or from India, or Canada, or whatever else it may be. We’ve got our, I think, our priorities completely wrong here. And we should not be discriminating on grounds of nationality.”

The Ukip leader also suggested that his party has sometimes used heightened rhetoric about immigration to get noticed. Asked about his desire to stop more immigrants with HIV and criminal records coming to the UK, he said such language was sometimes necessary “to wake people up”. “To wake people up to the truth of what’s going on, you sometimes have to say things in a way to get noticed, of that there’s no question,” he said.

Farage claimed Ukip was now fighting this general election campaign without a negative tone and “no longer needs to make the negative arguments about the effect that immigration has had on primary school places, on healthcare provision, on wage compression”.

However, Farage has mentioned the impact of immigration on public services many times during the campaign, including stressing that it would be wrong to fund the treatment of immigrants with HIV when the country cannot afford drugs for an 80-year-old with breast cancer. He brought up the issue of immigrants with life-threatening diseases unprompted during the first leaders’ debate.

He also criticised Davis’s questioning, accusing him of being a member of the “liberal metropolitan elite”.

Two more Farage interviews are being aired on Wednesday evening, on ITV and Channel 4, as Ukip gets more prominence from broadcasters since being designated a major party.

In a candid exchange with Channel 4 News, the Ukip leader revealed he made some mistakes at the beginning of the general election campaign. The politician has been under pressure as opinion polls suggest support for his party is sliding to below 14% and that he is facing a tight three-way battle to win the seat of South Thanet.

And Farage said that he had tried to do too much. “I started the campaign and think I made some mistakes,” he told Channel 4. “My desperation for Ukip to do well meant that I really packed the diary and the day in a way that frankly wasn’t very bright. I have now trimmed it back a bit. I’m being a bit more selective.”

Asked whether he had got a bit “wonky” at one point, Farage said: “I was. No, no. Hands up, I was. I had completely overdone it. I wasn’t getting it right. I feel a bit of the old vim and vigour back and I’m looking forward to the next fortnight.”

The Ukip leader strongly denied rumours about his ill-health at the party’s spring conference in Margate, Kent, accusing the Tories of spreading false claims about him and claiming to be “fit as a flea”.

However, since then, he published an autobiographical book, Purple Revolution, saying several health scares – including testicular cancer, a car crash and a light aircraft crash – have left him with the body of a 70-year-old.

David Cameron, meanwhile, has also been accused of looking like he is lacking enthusiasm during the campaign. The prime minister hit back at his critics on Wednesday by saying he has visited 26 places in less than a week.

Farage’s campaign has concentrated in a much smaller area than some of the other party leaders, as he tries to win his own target seat of South Thanet in Kent. He has pledged to stand down as leader if he does not become an MP.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Advice from a sub-group of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said on 3 March that the government should “advise against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging, given existing evidence about the importance of hand hygiene”.

“A public message against shaking hands has additional value as a signal about the importance of hand hygiene,” the Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) said. “Promoting a replacement greeting or encouraging others to politely decline a proffered handshake may have benefit.”

However, that same day Johnson told a press conference that he was continuing to shake hands with people.

“I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you will be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands,” he said. “People obviously can make up their own minds but I think the scientific evidence is … our judgment is that washing your hands is the crucial thing.”

At that time, his main public health message was that people should wash their hands while singing Happy Birthday twice. Politicians and scientists at the press conferences were still standing close together at their podiums. Several later came down with coronavirus, including Johnson.

Even if he had not yet received the advice that day, he was still seen shaking hands two days later, with the television presenter Phillip Schofield, and with the boxer Anthony Joshua on 9 March.

Johnson was confirmed as having coronavirus almost three weeks later on 27 March. His spokesman said Johnson “wouldn’t have seen” the advice before the press conference at which he boasted about continuing to shake hands.

The spokesman insisted the prime minister had taken other precautions, including regular handwashing, and that he changed his behaviour when the official advice changed.

He added that the paper was not direct advice to ministers, but had been prepared to contribute to the debate on Sage. “In general, in relation to the Sage papers [published on Tuesday], they were papers that had been considered by Sage, and informed the advice that was provided to ministers: they’re not Sage’s advice to ministers.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Officers approached Boris Johnson’s key adviser days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror has found. There are now calls for his resignation.

At the time, the government had instructed people not to travel and to stay at their family homes. Cummings, however, was seen in Durham. A member of the public is understood to have seen him and made a complaint to the police.

When asked if Cummings had been warned about breaching the lockdown, a spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: “On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an individual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.

“Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the individual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.

“In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.”

Downing Street has previously refused to disclose where Cummings was staying during the lockdown.

The Guardian has also been told Cummings was spotted near the gate of his parents’ home with a young child, believed to be his son, at around 5.45pm on Sunday 5 April, five days after the complaint was made to the police.

This was just over a week after he began self-isolating with symptoms of the virus. It was also less than two hours before the prime minister was admitted to hospital after his symptoms worsened.

The Guardian has previously asked Downing Street about this sighting in April, but officials declined to comment.

The disclosure that Cummings was spoken to by police raises potentially awkward questions for him and No 10. With the UK in the grip of the pandemic, the government’s own advice urged everyone to stay at their main homes to avoid the spread of the virus and to save lives.

“You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home,” the guidance said. “The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off.”

Instead, Cummings appears to have made the trip from his home in east London to Durham at a time when Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had tested positive.

Downing Street said Cummings had developed symptoms “over the weekend” of the 28 and 29 March.

When questioned about Cummings’ whereabouts during the following week, a Downing Street spokesperson said only that he was in contact with No 10.

A Durham resident who lives near the Cummings family home expressed shock and annoyance after the 5 April sighting.

The witness, who did not wish to be named, told the Guardian: “I was really annoyed. I thought it’s OK for you to drive all the way up to Durham and escape from London. I sympathise with him wanting to do that, but other people are not allowed to do that. It’s one rule for Dominic Cummings and one rule for the rest of us.”

Tulip Siddiq MP, the vice chair of the Labour party, said of the reports: “If accurate, the prime minister’s chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government’s guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel. The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings. Number 10 needs to provide a very swift explanation for his actions.”

The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, tweeted: “If Dominic Cummings has broken the lockdown guidelines he will have to resign. It’s as simple as that.”

Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, said: “Dominic Cummings’ position is completely untenable – he must resign or be sacked.”

Breaking lockdown rules has been a resigning issue for senior officials.

Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for flouting physical distancing rules when he was visited by his girlfriend.

After he stood aside, senior Tories insisted he had done the right thing.

Hancock said he was “speechless” and added: “I think he took the right decision to resign.”



The former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said Ferguson’s behaviour “risks undermining the government’s lockdown message”.

Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was also forced to quit after making two trips to her second home during the coronavirus lockdown.

The sightings raise questions about the government’s commitment to the “stay at home” message it was repeating to the public in the first stage of the lockdown. The Guardian has already revealed that the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, travelled to his parents’ home on the same weekend. Jenrick said he was delivering medicine and essential supplies.

Cummings was seen running through Downing Street on 27 March after it was announced that Johnson and Hancock had tested positive for coronavirus.

Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, an editor at the Spectator, last month gave a detailed account of how they coped under lockdown while having the symptoms of coronavirus.

Writing in the magazine, Wakefield said that Cummings rushed home to look after her when she began showing symptoms. A day later he began feeling “weird” and then couldn’t get out of bed. “Day in, day out for 10 days he lay doggo with a high fever and spasms,” she said.

The article goes on: “Just as Dom was beginning to feel better ... Boris was heading in the other direction, into hospital.” This was the evening when Cummings was first seen near Durham with the child. On the same evening, Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was forced to resign after she was photographed visiting her second home in Fife.

Wakefield’s article does not say where they were during quarantine, but it adds: “After the uncertainty of the bug itself, we emerged from quarantine into almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.” Wakefield has been asked to clarify whether the family were in their London home at the time.

In the same issue of the Spectator, Cummings wrote: “At the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we were both shut in together.” He described the experience as “sticky … Everything is covered in a layer of spilt Ribena, honey, peanut butter and playschool glue.”

A witness said they were going past the Cummings family home on 5 April on their regular exercise route when they heard Abba’s Dancing Queen playing loudly from the property.

“I got the shock of my life, as I looked over to the gates and saw him,” they said. “There was a child, presumably his little boy, running around in front. I recognised Dominic Cummings, he’s a very distinctive figure.”

Despite the mild weather that weekend, they said Cummings was wearing a dark coat and thick tartan scarf. “He must have been wearing them to protect himself while recovering from Covid-19,” they said.

The Guardian approached Downing Street for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.

On Thursday evening, a portion of the British media exercised its own prerogative: to attack the judges behind the ruling.

Some lawyers and legal experts thought “enemies of the people” was perhaps a little over the top:

• Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader, has used a speech to both Houses of Parliament to urge Britain to support her country as it moves to democracy.

My country today stands at the start of a journey towards, I hope, a better future. So many hills remain to be climbed, chasms to be bridged, obstacles to be breached. Our own determination can get us so far. The support of the people of Britain and of peoples around the world can get us so much further.

Earlier David Cameron, who held talks with her in Downing Street, called her ""a symbol of courage"". John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, said she was ""the conscience of a country and a heroine for humanity"".

• The Conservative MP who chairs the Commons eduction committee, Graham Stuart, has expressed doubt about Michael Gove's plan to abolish GCSEs. ""I'm sceptical that some return to O-levels is going to bring about some transformation,"" Stuart said. (See 2.41pm.) He spoke out after it emerged that the Liberal Democrats are determined to wreck the plans. As my colleague Nicholas Watt reports, Clegg, who is in Brazil at the Rio+20 summit, instructed senior party officials in a transatlantic telephone call to condemn the plans and to denounce Gove in highly personal terms shortly after the education secretary outlined his plans to MPs in an emergency commons statement. In an article for the Guardian, Peter Wilby says that Gove's move would mark a giant step towards the reintroduction of selection in English schools.

• David Cameron has declined to criticise Gary Barlow for engaging in tax avoidance. He said that although he did speak out about Jimmy Carr's tax arrangements, he would not be criticising celebrities generally. This is what he said when he was asked about Barlow at a news conference.



I am not going to give a running commentary on different people's tax affairs. I don't think that would be right. I made an exception yesterday because it was a very specific case where the details seemed to have been published and it was a particularly egregious example of an avoidance scheme that seemed to me to be wrong and I made that point.

Cameron said tax planning, such as putting money into a pension pot, was sensible. But aggressive tax avoidance was morally questionable.



I think it is right not only for politicians to make that point but frankly to go after some of the aggressive avoidance schemes. It isn't right at a time of economic difficulty to have these very aggressive anti-avoidance schemes in existence.

• Downing Street has suggested it is preparing to abandon plans for David Cameron and senior ministers to disclose their tax returns, amid allegations of hypocrisy over the prime minister's decision to comment on Jimmy Carr's tax affairs.

• The government's climate change envoy has warned that failure to take more action to invest in a low carbon economy was a threat to the future ""prosperity and security"" of the British people. As my colleague Juliette Jowit reports, John Ashton, who has just stepped down from his post at the Foreign Office, told MPs that the UK was still considered an influential ""global player"" on climate change, but that that position was at risk as the country was falling behind on investment in energy efficiency and clean energy.

Failure to deal with climate change would amplify already dangerous stresses arising from food, water and energy insecurity ... This potentially unmanageable combination of stresses poses a systemic risk to the security and prosperity of our country.





• The Department for Business has published plans to cut the amount of time firms have to wait before they can sack large numbers of staff. As the Press Association reports, Norman Lamb has launched a consultation on cutting the time required for consultation before firms can lay off more than 100 members of staff from 90 days to 45 or 30 days. Ministers say they want a new code of practice to improve the quality of communication between managers and staff, but the TUC said there was no need to change arrangements.

• The Equalities and Human Rights Commission has confirmed that it is going to get rid of about 100 staff. As the Press Association reports, a consultation has been launched on moves to lower the commission's costs, including reducing its 257-strong workforce to about 150. The commission, which will no longer provide a helpline, will also operate from fewer offices.



• Firefighters in Essex have announced five strikes lasting between an hour and 24 hours between 28 July and 18 October, in a dispute over changes to the service.

That's it for today. Thanks for the comments.

BBC News have just shown a clip of one of the best bits from Aung San Suu Kyi's speech. I suppose you could call it a snub to John Bercow. He keeps telling MPs that their behaviour at PMQs is juvenile. But she said rowdy behaviour was the sign of a true democracy.

Thus far I have only spent a matter of minutes in the Burmese parliament ... I must say that I found the atmosphere rather formal. Men are required to wear formal headgear. There is certainly no heckling. I would wish that over time, perhaps, we will reflect the liveliness and relative informality of Westminster. I am not unaware of the saying that more tears have been shed over wishes granted than over wishes denied. Nevertheless it is when Burma has its own satisfactory equivalent of prime minister's questions that we will be able to say that parliamentary democracy has truly come of age.

My colleague Nicholas Watt has been talking to sources in the education department about Michael Gove's plan to abolish GCSEs. On Twitter, he says they think the Lib Dems are over-reacting.

Here's the text of John Bercow's speech welcoming Suu Kyi to parliament. And here's an extract.

[Suu Kyi] has been the symbol of resistance to a regime which even in an imperfect world has been exceptional in its barbarity. As the UN has documented, and from three trips to Burma's borders I can myself attest, this is a cabal guilty of rape as a weapon of war, extra-judicial killings, compulsory relocation, forced labour, deployment of child soldiers, use of human minesweepers, incarceration of opponents in unspeakable conditions, destruction of villages, obstruction of aid and excruciating torture. Burma has become a beautiful but benighted land where fear runs through society like blood flowing through veins. One woman has now defied a dictatorship of such depravity for two decades. That is why Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a leader and a stateswoman, is here with us this afternoon.

And here's the text of the speech by Lady D'Souza, the Lord Speaker, thanking her for her speech. Here's an extract.

We all espouse freedom and democracy but few of us are called upon to pay for and uphold these principles by spending 15 years in detention. Your presence here today is a testament to your courageous approach of steadfast non-violence and reason in the face of an oppressive, powerful and determined regime.

Here's the top of the Press Association story about Aung San Suu Kyi's speech.

Aung San Suu Kyi appealed to Britain today ""as friend and an equal"" to support the people of Burma in their drive for democracy.

Delivering a historic address to a joint session of both Houses of Parliament, the Nobel peace laureate said she was seeking practical help to address the problems still besetting her country.

In particular, she said she hoped the UK could help rebuild the education system while providing new investment for the future.

""I am here in part to ask for practical help, help as a friend and an equal, in support of the reforms which can bring better lives, greater opportunities, to the people of Burma who have been for so long deprived of their rights and their place in the world,"" she said.

""My country today stands at the start of a journey towards, I hope, a better future. So many hills remain to be climbed, chasms to be bridged, obstacles to be breached.

""Our own determination can get us so far. The support of the people of Britain and of peoples around the world can get us so much further.""

Suu Kyi, who received a standing ovation from MPs and peers in a packed Westminster Hall, said the key to reform was the establishment of a strong parlimentary institution.

She said that after 49 years of direct military rule, it would take time for the country's fledgling parliament to find its feet and its voice.

""Our new legislative processes, which are undoubtedly an improvement on what went before, are not as transparent as they might be,"" she said.

""I would like to see us learn from established examples of parliamentary democracies elsewhere so that we might deepen our own democratic standards over time.""

Suu Kyi says her journey out of Burma has not been a sentimental pilgrimage to the past. She has been looking to the future.

She says she has found the response she's received very moving.

During her house arrest, it was not just the BBC that kept her in touch with the world outside. Music and culture persuaded her she would never be alone.

The prizes she received were not so much a personal recognition, but a wider statement that she would never be left alone.

She quotes from a poem that Churchill quoted in one of his wartime speeches.



And not by eastern windows only, When daylight comes, comes in the light; In front the sun climbs slow, how slowly! But westward, look, the land is bright!

Suu Kyi says she hopes that Britain will continue to help Burma through targeted aid assistance.

Measures to combat unemployment are particularly important, she says.

She appeals for ""democracy-friendly investment"". She means investment that prioritises democracy, accountability and environmental sustainability.

The extractive industries transparency initiative secretariat is coming to Burma, she says. She hopes there will be further initiatives like this.

Suu Kyi says Burma has not known a time when there has been peace throughout the land in 60 years of independence.

Suu Kyi says she has only spent a few minutes in Burma's parliament. It is very formal. Men have to wear a headress. And there is no hecking.

She says she would like the Burmese parliament to be a bit more lively, like Britain's. It should reflect the passions of the people, she says.

Suu Kyi says if the Burmese do not get things right this time around, it may take many decades before they get another chance.

She says Britain should support the ""nascent parliamentary democracy"".

Without strong institutions, this process will not be sustainable.

She says she hopes Britain will share its experiences with Burma.

Suu Kyi says the Burmese election revealed a passion for something ""long denied"".

Burma's parliamentary era was not perfect. But it was the most promising period until now.

Suu Kyi says it is appropriate to be speaking in Westminster Hall. Reform in Burma will depend on the country getting an independent parliament.

Wesminster has been a symbol for freedom of speech around the world. In London some people may take this for granted. But in Burma these freedoms are not taken for granted.

Burma has had 49 years of direct military rule. It will take a while for democracy to find its feet.

Suu Kyi says she would like Burma to learn from other parliamentary models.

People participate in a free election in a democracy. In Burma, in the election earlier this year, people understood how important this right was.

Suu Kyi says she did not have the right to vote when she was living in the UK. But she encouraged other people to vote.

To those who feel themselves above politics, she says they should not. Politics is integral to existence.

She recalls that once, living in Oxford, a canvasser came to the house. Her husband told the woman that his wife determined how he voted.

Suu Kyi says the election in Burma was largely free and fair. She pays tribute to the president, Thein Sein, for this.

Suu Kyi says General Slim recalled meeting her father in his memoirs. Slim told him that he was only speaking to the British because they were winning the war. Her father said there would be no point talking to the British if they were losing.

Aung San Suu Kyi says she understand that there was a debate about whether she should speak in Westminster Hall, or somewhere else. She welcomes that debate. That's what parliaments are for.

She says she is glad to have been to Number 10. The most famous picture of her father is one of him at Number 10 with Clement Attlee, where they were discussing Burma's independence.

She says her father was a founding member of the Burmese independence army. He thought democracy was the only valid political system. It's a view she shares, she says.

John Bercow says many people have spoken in Westminster Hall over the last 900 years.

In recent years heads of state like President Obama have spoken here.

But Aung San Suu Kyi is the first person to do so who is not a leader of a country, the first woman from abroad and the first person from Asia.

He says Burma is run by a brutal cabal.

Burma has become ""a beautiful but benighted land where fear runs through society like blood running through veins"".

Suu Kyi has resisted that. That is why she is here this afternoon.

There is room for ""cautious optimism"", he says. The election of Suu Kyi to parliament is a sign of reform. We hope there will be more reform, he says.

There is an Asian saying that a journey of a 1,000 miles must start with a single step.

We are proud that one such step is being taken in this parliament today.

Bercow says Suu Kyi is a ""conscience for a country"" and a heroine.

John Bercow is speaking.

(We could be here for a while ..)

Aung San Suu Kyi is about to address both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall.

She's the first woman after the Queen to do so.

Here's John Bercow bringing her into the hall.

And here are Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband and David Cameron applauding.

As promised, here is the key quote from Graham Stuart, the Conservative chairman of the Commons education committee, about Michael Gove's plan to scrap GCSEs. He was speaking on the World at One.

I'm sceptical that some return to O-levels is going to bring about some transformation. It's only the tiniest number of children at the very top who fail to be differentiated by the current GCSE system. I think there are a lot of questions to ask. Why is the government focusing with things like the Ebacc? We are setting out a policy that appears to be more focused on the children who we serve relatively well and who internationally we do quite well with, which are the brighter kids, and not focusing on the central problem we have which is doing a better job for the children at the bottom.

Stuart said that in principle he was not opposed to a two-tier exam system. But it would have to be one that delivered for less academic pupils, as well as more academic ones.

He also said he was ""disappointed"" about the way the story had come out in a leak to the Daily Mail.

You can listen to the full interview here.

Stuart's committee has just finished an inquiry into exams for 15 to 19-year-olds. The report has been agreed but, according to a spokeswoman for the committee, ""a decision has been taken that it will not be published while children are still sitting public exams so it is set to appear in early July"".

Turning back to Michael Gove and GCSEs for a moment, the Lib Dem onslaught continues. Tim Farron (pictured), the party president, has just put out this statement.

Returning to a two-tier exam system would be madness. The O-level/CSE system was divisive and dumped less academic young people into a second division from which they couldn't escape, providing a fixed limit on the expectations of those young people who were saddled with having to sit the CSE. I say this with some bitterness and personal experience having a couple of CSEs to my name. By all means, lets look at the GCSE and consider reforms – Michael Gove is perfectly within his rights to do that – but let's kill off immediately any talk of returning to the divisive 2-tier system that Mrs Thatcher wisely ended in the late 80s.

A question from ITN's Tom Bradby.

Q: What does the rest of the world need to do to help Burma?

Suu Kyi says Burma is at ""the most difficult"" stage. This period will be more difficult than the period before. Now will decide what happens in 2015, and whether Burma makes the breakthrough to democracy.

She says she wants Burma's friends to pay attention to what is happening in the country.

More than ever our friends need to be watchdogs. By our friends, I'm not just referring to the countries of the West, but our neighbours, our regional friends in south Asia.

She says Burma's need is ""greater than it has ever been"".

Cameron says Suu Kyi has been open about Burma's need for transparent aid, and for trade.



Q: Does Cameron think Gary Barlow's tax affairs are morally wrong? And should he give back his OBE?

Cameron says he is not going to give a running commentary on specific people's tax affairs. He made an exception yesterday for Jimmy Carr because the details had been published and they were ""egregious"".

Some of the aggressive anti-avoidance schemes that may not be illegal are morally questionable. Politicians should go after them.



Q: Is it because Barlow is a friend of yours?

No, says Cameron. It's because there were specific details in the public domain about Carr. It is up to the Revenue to investigate individuals.

Cameron says it was honour to be able to invite Suu Kyi to the UK. She has been inspirational. She gave up so much. It was an act of huge political selflessness.

Cameron and Suu Kyi are now taking questions.

Q: [From the BBC's John Simpson] Is it appropriate to invite President Thein Sein to Britain?

Cameron says it is the right decision. There is a process of reform in Burma. Britain has to work with the regime. Cameron says he believes Thein Sein is sincere about the need for reform.

Suu Kyi also says it was right to invite Thein Sein.

Aung San Suu Kyi says she wants Burma's future to be in the hands of its people.

David Cameron is holding his press conference now.

He says Britain has three priorities for Burma.

First, it will strengthen Burma's democracy. It will invest ""people and money"" in this.

Second, it will promote peace.

Third, it will invest in economic development.

Britain will remain a ""resolute friend"" to Burma and to Aung San Suu Kyi.

Graham Stuart, the Conservative chairman of the Commons education committee, has grabbed a few nails and joined the Lib Dems in their coffin-hammering attempt to kill Michael Gove's plans to replace GCSEs. He spoke out on the World at One. I will post the full quotes when I get them, but here's a flavour, from Twitter.

Tory Graham Stuartcriticises Gove plans for return of O levels #wato as ""back to the future..I'm sceptical"" — norman smith (@BBCNormanS) June 21, 2012

Devastating attack on #govelevels from Tory education comm chairman Graham Stuart: ""How will this narrowgap between rich and poor?"" #wato — Rob Merrick (@Rob_Merrick) June 21, 2012

Here's a lunchtime summary.

• The Liberal Democrats have indicated that they will seek to block Michael Gove's plan to replace GCSEs with a new O-level-style qualification for more able pupils. A senior party source said that the party was ""very, very hostile to something that looks like it is going to return to the two-tier system of the past"". And Dan Rogerson, a Lib Dem MP and co-chair of the party's parliamentary committee on education, put out a statement criticising the plan.

A two-tier system, with all the upheaval and instability this would cause, is not the way to achieve higher standards across the board. Reform needs to be managed carefully and we should avoid creating a huge amount of turbulence and distraction in the education system for no real gain. Rather than harking back to an age when children started their adult life with qualifications that were seen as second rate, we want to look forward and work with teachers and schools to give them the freedom and tools needed to stretch pupils, drive up standards and entrench a culture of high expectations in every school.

Teaching unions have also expressed disbelief at the plans, which were revealed in a story in the Daily Mail based on a leaked document. Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, Gove said that he would be publishing a consultation paper in due course and that England already had a two-tier education system that was failing those at the bottom. But the outright Lib Dem opposition to his plan suggests that he will have difficulty implementing his ambition.

• The comedian Jimmy Carr has issued an apology for his ""terrible error of judgment"" over using a tax avoidance scheme. As Patrick Wintour and Rajeev Syal report, Carr confirmed that he had changed his tax affairs after the scheme was revealed this week. On Wednesday David Cameron had labelled the situation ""morally wrong"". In a series of tweets the comedian said: ""I appreciate as a comedian, people will expect me to 'make light' of this situation, but I'm not going to in this statement as this is obviously a serious matter."" At business question in the Commons Angela Eagle, the shadow leader of the House, accused Cameron of not being consistent when criticising celebrities for tax avoidance.

Oddly he did not take the opportunity to condemn as morally repugnant the tax avoidance scheme used by Conservative supporter Gary Barlow, who has given a whole new meaning to the phrase 'take that'. If he is also morally repugnant, why is he just been given an OBE in the Birthday Honours?

• Andrew Lansley has pleaded with doctors and medics not to take industrial action as protests began over changes to their pensions that they regard both as unfair and unnecessary.

• Nick Clegg has given a speech at the Rio+20 summit saying Britain is playing a leading role in encouraging countries to measure their wealth not just in terms of GDP.

We are working with our statistical authorities in the United Kingdom to develop a more, a richer more multi-dimensional statistical assessment of our, of our well-being and why we are such enthusiastic supporters providing £3m's worth of support to the World Bank's Waves initiative which is designed explicitly to help other countries develop their own means of measuring not only growth in the narrow snapshot sense of the word, but also the resources upon which we all depend ... If we succeed and build on what they have done, we will look back in my view on this event as an extremely important one indeed because if in ten, fifteen, twenty years' time we no longer assess our wealth and our prosperity in the narrow snapshot terms of GDP alone, but give people a clear, easily understood measurement of our long term prosperity and sustainability upon which we, with which we use our resources, I think we can genuinely start changing things for good.

• Campaigners fighting the government's plans for Lords reform have said the proposals could cost more than £484m by 2020. ""At a time of national austerity, it is hard to imagine how anyone could justify spending nearly £500m of taxpayers' money on what would be an unprecedented constitutional upheaval,"" said the Tory MP Jesse Norman on behalf of the Campaign for an Effective Second Chamber.

• Downing Street has played down the claim by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secetary, saying Britain could be facing a decade of spending cuts. As the Press Association reports, speaking to civil servants in Westminster last night, Heywood warned that spending restraint could last ""seven, eight, maybe 10 years"". A No 10 spokeswoman said his ""off-the-cuff remarks"" referred to the future shape of the civil service and were fully in line with government policy. ""He was talking very much in the context of Civil Service reform,"" the spokeswoman said. ""He was not trying to predict what spending down the track might look like. Sir Jeremy was being off the cuff. He was not setting out a different policy.""



• William Hague, the foreign secretary, has described the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi as ""a symbol of hope"" ahead of address to both Houses of Parliament this afternoon. Downing Street has also confirmed that President Thein Sein, the Burmese leader, has been invited to visit Britain.

• MPs have been told that the final cost of last year's referendum on the alternative vote was £75m. The figure was disclosed by Gary Streeter, who answers questions in the Commons on behalf of the Speaker's committee on the Electoral Commission,

My colleague Nicholas Watt is using his Twitter feed to report more Lib Dem reaction to Michael Gove's plan to scrap GSCEs.





Nick Clegg will reject Michael Gove's plans to scrap GCSEs which were not briefed to any Lib Dems – snr party source Michael Gove's exam plans 'look like an attempt to bounce' Lib Dems. Doubt if plans known outside his private office – snr party source Nick Clegg + Lib Dem educ minister Sarah Teather furious no briefing from Gove. 'We've been scrabbling around in the dark' - source

Sky's Sophy Ridge has posted this on Twitter.

Senior LibDem:""Nick Clegg thinks we should be raising expectation for all children not returning to a two tier system that let down so many"" — Sophy Ridge (@SophyRidgeSky) June 21, 2012

Here is a summary of the key points on Michael Gove's statement.

• Gove said that he would soon be publishing a consultation paper on reforming the examination system in England. He refused to comment on any of the details in the story about the government's plans in the Daily Mail, which says pupils will start studying for the new O-level-style qualifications from September 2014. But he said the government would proceed carefully.



These are inevitably challenging ambitions which will require careful implementation. That is why we wish the conversation about how we raise standards to be broad and inclusive.

• He claimed the current examination system was flawed.



Heads have told us that the current league table system incentivises weak schools to push students towards soft subjects and easier exams. Parents and students have told us that there are weaknesses with current GCSEs, which privilege bite-sized learning over deep understanding, gobbets of knowledge over real learning.

• He said that having competition in the setting of exams had not worked.

We want to tackle the culture of competitive dumbing-down, by making sure that exam boards cannot compete with each other on the basis of how easy their exams are.

• He said that he wanted pupils to be able to take exams that were more rigorous than GCSEs.



We would like to see every student in this country able to take world class qualifications, like the rigorous and respected exams which are taken, for example, by Singapore's students.

• He said that under Labour, although exam results had improved, England had fallen behind in international league tables.

While there were undoubtedly improvements in our schools and by our teachers over the course of the last 20 years, those improvements were not sufficient to ensure that we kept pace with other jurisdictions ... The sad truth is that if we look at the objective measure of how we did over the last 10 or 15 years, in reading our score in international league tables fell from 523 to 494; in maths from 529 to 492; and in science from 528 to 514. Every objective academic study of what has happened in our education system has drawn attention to the weakness of our qualifications.

• He rejected claims that his plans would create a two tier education system. That was because a two-tier system already existed, he said.

The sad truth is that we already have a two-tier system in education in this country. Some of our most impressive schools have already left the GCSE behind and have opted for the IGCSE or other more rigorous examinations. And it is also the case, sadly, that 40% of children do not include five good GCSEs including English and Maths. [Kevin Brennan, the shadow education minister] said that under the proposals that are being reported that 25% of children would be left behind. The sad truth is that at least 40% of children have been left behind under the current system that we have.





• He rejected the claim made by Chris Cook, the FT's education correspondent, that his plans would lead to the creation of a new qualification for poor children. Gove said he had read the blog Cook posted this morning.



I think that it suffers from one thing. It itself is a prisoner of the culture of low aspiration that we have tackled.

• He said England's education system was ""one of the most inequitable, one of the most stratified and segregated"" in the world.

• He rejected claims that he wanted to take England back to the 1950s.

What we want to do is not to look backwards, but outwards. We want to ask ourselves why is it that there are other countries that have stronger exam systems and that also make opportunity more equal. Why is it the case that in countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, in Canada, Australia and New Zealand that they both manage to have a higher level of absolute attainment and a more equal society and a more equal education system. That is what we want to achieve.

• He said he was a ""Blairite"" in terms of political philosophy. He believed in what worked, he explained.

So, what have we learnt from Gove's response to the urgent question about his plan to scrap GCSEs?

When ministers have to answer questions about leaked stories about their intentions, they can do one of two things: play it all down, and suggest the newspaper has exaggerated a proposal that hasn't yet got off the drawing board; or defend it robustly, as if it is already policy. Gove adopted the second tactic. Earlier, having seen the way large chunks of the education establishment (include HMC, which represents independent schools), I thought Gove might be tempted to have second thoughts. I was wrong.

That said, Gove said virtually nothing about what his plans actually. You will learn more reading the Daily Mail. All he actually told MPs was that he wanted to raise standards and that he would be publishing a consultation paper shortly.

So we did not get any detail at all? But we got some indication as to his direction of travel. I'll post a proper summary shortly.

The Gove statement is over.

Labour's Diana Johnson asks Gove to look at Finland, which leads tables of education standards.

Gove says he has looked at Finland. They attract and retain the very best teachers, he says.

Labour's Alison Seabeck asks Gove if he thinks that people who can't achieve will go to the wall.

Gove says competition can raise standards. But poorly designed competition can lead to a race to the bottom.

Tessa Munt, a Lib Dem MP, says having a single examining board would make things easier for children like those from service families who move around.

Gove says this is a good point.

Labour's Richard Burden asks if Gove is going to re-introduce CSEs. Won't that stigmatise children?

Gove says this is a fair point. He is not saying more now because the Department of Education is still considering this. There should be a collective national conversation, he says. He wants to avoid dumbing down, and learn from the best examples in the world.

Labour's Angela Smith says Gove's plan could take England back to the 1950s.

Gove says that's wrong. Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia have higher standards and more social aspiration, he says.

Gove says he wants children to receive a 21st-century education. That means ""additional rigour"".

Labour's David Wright says the introduction of GCSEs was a ""progressive, Thatcherite"" policy. Can Gove ensure that his plans will not result in pupils being left behind?

Gove says in ideological matters he is a Blairite. He believes in what works.

Amber Rudd, a Conservative, asks Gove to ensure that he works with the Russell Group of universities.

Gove agrees.

Philip Davies says the introduction of GCSEs led to standards being watered down. Now having 10 GCSEs can be meaningless.

Gove says employers have a ""lack of confidence"" in the qualifications.

Pupils are being let down as a result, he says. He thinks teaching is as good as ever. And pupils are working harder than they have worked before. But the qualifications need to be changed.

Labour's Julie Hilling says CSEs had little value. How can Gove be sure they will have value in the future?

Gove says employers do not have faith in D and E passes at GCSE.

Peter Lilley, a Conservative, says the British education system has failed to produce enough people with technical qualifications. Will Gove's reforms tackle that?

Gove says he agrees. Technical education has been weak since 1851. (What happened then?)

Labour's Pat McFadden asks Gove about the Chris Cook analysis in the FT. (See 9.54am.)

Gove says the government needs to tackle the culture of low aspiration. Any reform of the examination system would need to ensure that it did not place a cap on aspiration.

He says he has read the Cook piece. He thinks Cook is a prisoner of low aspiration.

Dan Rogerson, a Lib Dem MP, says he is ""very concerned"" that a two-tier system would stop less-able pupils achieving above a certain level.

Gove says there should be no cap on aspiration. Pupils could take the harder exams at a later stage, he says.

Labour's Frank Field says Gove should focus on the foundation years. Gove says the government is doing this already.

Elizabeth Truss, a Conservative, welcomes the idea of having a single examining board. There has been a ""race to the bottom"", she says.

Gove says Conor Ryan, a former Labour education adviser, said this morning that having a single examinations board was a good idea.

Labour's David Blunkett asks why Margaret Thatcher scrapped O-levels.

Gove says ""wrong turnings"" were taken under Labour. One involved ""a race to the bottom"".

Graham Stuart, the Conservative chairman of the education committee, says he welcomes rigour. But how will these plans improve the outcomes for the poorest children?

Gove says this is an important point. England's system is one of the most inequitable in the world. Gove says he wants to raise expectations.

Gove is responding.

Brennan said the plan would create a two-tier system. But we already have a two-tier system. At least 40% of children are already left behind. There is no excuse not to act.

This is not an attempt to move backwards, he says.

It is an attempt to ensure England keeps up with the best in the world.

The ""sad truth"" is that the objective measures of performance shows England falling down international league tables in reading, maths and science.

The next generation deserve a world-class education, he says.

Labour's Kevin Brennan says Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, says he is not here because he is involved in an important meeting about the murder of a constituent.

Brennan says the Gove plan would take pupils ""back to the future"".

Labour wants higher literacy and numeracy standards. But the key to that is to lift teaching standards. At best, the Gove plan would be a ""distraction"". Only 30% of pupils got a good GCSE in 1997. In 2010 it was more than half.

A return to the CSE would involve writing off children, he says.

He suggests this is a ""softening up exercise to disguise a fall in attainment"".

What is the evidence that this will actually work?

Michael Gove is responding to the statement now.

He says the coaliton wants to raise standards in schools.

It has already taken steps to make the primary curriculum more rigorous.

Draft programmes for study are out now, he says.

The government inherited a situation where too many primary school pupils left primary school unable to read and write properly. That was a crime against social mobility.

At secondary level, the government has also made teaching more rigorous.

But the government has been told that it needs to go futher. Falling standards in schools are not a laughing matter.

The current system encourages pupils to take easy exams.

Academics say improvement in exam results have not been matched by improvements in understanding.

The government has been looking at this and will publish a consultation paper shortly. It wants pupils to be able to take world-class exams. Singapore is a model.

These plans will require careful implementaion.

Gove says he wants a broad conversation. But he wants a clear outcome: a system where children are required to do more.

The urgent question in the Commons on Michael Gove's plan to scrap GCSEs is starting in five minutes. I'll be covering it in detail.

You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here.

• Peter Oborne in the Daily Telegraph says David Cameron should move George Osborne and make him Conservative chairman.

Mr Osborne is a talented courtier and has made himself personally indispensable to every Conservative leader since John Major. This makes him an interesting and instructively paradoxical politician. Embedded in the Westminster village since leaving university, the Chancellor has an unusually sophisticated understanding of the art of politics for a man who is only 41 years old, matched by jaw-dropping naivety about everything else. He carries out two extraordinarily important jobs. He is at the same time the real Conservative Party chairman and the Chancellor. Arguably, he carries out three roles, because Mr Osborne is also the Prime Minister's primary confidante and adviser ... Probably the best solution would be to make an honest man of the Chancellor, and send him to Central Office with his ally Stephen Gilbert with a brief to win the next election. Philip Hammond in that case would make a natural successor, and probably an improvement. What is beyond doubt is that Mr Osborne must be forced to make a choice. Tony Blair regrets bitterly to this day that he never shifted Gordon Brown out of the Treasury. David Cameron now faces a comparable decision. It remains to be seen whether he has the wisdom, the insight or the stomach to make the right decision.

• Yvette Cooper in the Times (paywall) says Labour made mistakes on immigration.

This isn't the easiest subject for the Labour Party. In government we didn't do enough to address people's concerns on immigration. By the election, we had lost the argument — people felt that the system was unfair and politicians weren't listening.We need to change. Migration policy matters immensely to the public and to our economy. Low public trust undermines cohesion and democracy. All political parties need to work harder to get it right, and this week Ed Miliband will set out Labour's new approach. Rapidly rising global travel and trade increased migration into the world's major economies by around 70 per cent in a decade. That demands stronger controls to maintain confidence and keep the system fair, alongside wider action on the causes and consequences of immigration. For example, we should have brought the points-based system in earlier to restrict low-skilled migration. And we should have adopted transitional controls for Eastern Europe. Immigration brings pressures and anxieties as well as important economic and cultural benefits. Yet Labour wasn't discussing the impact people felt in their lives. Nor did we look at the unequal consequences — who benefited and who lost out. We've heard that message loud and clear, and Labour needs to change as a result.

• Melanie Newman and Oliver Wright in the Independent says some bishops are claiming up to £27,000 a year to attend the House of Lords, on top of their annual stipends, while others are claiming nothing.

Bishops are claiming up to £27,000 a year in fixed-rate allowances to attend sessions of the House of Lords on top of their travel costs. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism and The Independent has found that some bishops are claiming up to the maximum fixed allowance for attending sessions in the second chamber while having full-time jobs in their dioceses. Others attend sessions in the House without making any claim on the public purse.

Here's some more reaction to Michael Gove's plan to scrap GCSEs.

From Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union

This appears to be yet another example of the secretary of state's ambition to create a two-tier education system. Thousands of young people will be taking their GCSEs today and, at a time when they need a confidence boost, they are being told by the secretary of state that the examinations they are taking are worthless. The timing for the proposed changes, 2014, the eve of a general election, is interesting. Could it be that the secretary of state is not confident that his education reforms will raise standards and is, therefore, is seeking to cover his tracks by removing anything that can provide a year-on-year comparator? There is no evidence that the current system is broken, that examinations are getting easier or that our qualifications are trailing behind the best in the world. Michael Gove's arrogance is breathtaking. Not only is he upsetting thousands of young people, parents and teachers but he is also consigning Margaret Thatcher's historic education reforms to the dustbin of history.

From Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL)

O-levels were an examination that existed for a small proportion of the population, that was part of the preparation for university. It was an academic qualification, and at the time when O-levels existed vast numbers of young people left either with no qualifications or ones that employers regarded as inferior. The last thing we want to do, when we are ambitious for our education service, is to create a two-tier system. It does risk labelling teenagers as failures. In recent years we have done a lot to motivate children, to improve attendance, reduced disengagement and truancy, and this is key to the very real improvements that have taken place in schools. [The plans are] a massive risk to the well-being of students.



From Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT).

The return to a two-tier system, CSEs and O-levels, implicitly labels some children as less capable ... The idea this once worked is a myth.

From the Times's Greg Hurst

Blimey HMC comment: 'Knee-jerk return to nostalgic golden age of O levels run by a state monopoly examination board naïve, will suit nobody' — Greg Hurst (@GregHurstTimes) June 21, 2012

HMC is the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, which represents indendent schools.

Cabinet ministers are not planning to release details of their tax affairs any time soon, according to the Press Association. They've just filed this.



David Cameron and senior ministers are not planning to disclose their tax returns in the ""very near future"", Downing Street indicated today.

The prime minister said in April that he expected information about his finances to become public, and was relaxed about the prospect.

The comment came amid controversy over the decision to cut the 50p top tax rate, and after London mayoral candidates released their records.

But a Number 10 aide said this morning that the proposal is still being ""looked into"".

Ministers are ""not closed to the idea"", but it is ""not a very near-future thing"", the aide added.

The BBC's Ross Hawkins has posted this on Twitter.

There will be an urgent question on O-Levels 1100 in Commons from Shadow Education Minister Kevin Brennan. — Ross Hawkins (@rosschawkins) June 21, 2012

The Financial Times's Chris Cook has posted an excellent analysis of Michael Gove's plan to scrap GSCEs on an FT blog. Here's an extract.

The most significant issues around this idea are related to social mobility: the CSE [the easier alternative to the new O-level proposed by Gove] will tend to be an exam for poorer children. Consider who would take the CSE if schools could select the quarter of pupils with the lowest average grades with perfect foresight ... This matters: one would expect it to lower aspirations among children put onto the CSE track – which would presumably happen at the age of 14. If a child gets moved onto the scheme who otherwise would be aiming for a C at GCSE, they may just stop trying. This could happen, to an extent, when pupils only sit the so-called ""foundation papers"" for GCSEs now. But children taking such papers can still get a C at GCSE, and they do not have a qualification on their CV which suggests to employers that teachers thought they were low-ability.

The other big story around today, of course, is Michael Gove's plan to scrap GCSEs. It's a Daily Mail exclusive splash. Our version of it is here.

Here's some reaction.

From Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary

Michael Gove must explain his changes to parents and pupils. Will going back to O-levels for some and CSEs for the rest really improve standards for all? Labour wants to see a robust, rigorous and broad curriculum and exam system that is trusted by parents, pupils and employers. We will set a series of tests to measure these changes. To succeed in the modern world, young people need a broad education, not a narrow one. Will pupils doing these new exams get access to creative or innovative learning that will create the jobs of the future? Will this divide children at fourteen into winners and losers? With no secondary national curriculum how will he ensure a rigorous approach to learning in all schools? When the Tories abolished O-levels and introduced GCSEs in the 1980s they said standards would rise. Now they say they've fallen. If there is to be a major overhaul parents will want reassurance that the new system will enable all children to progress and reach their full potential.

From Lord Baker, the former Conservative education secretary who introduced the GCSE

What is important is to ensure that the other subjects that are taken [ie, the easier alternative to the new O Levels] don't become a second-class area of poor performance. The CSE certificate which we did away with in the 80s became a valueless bit of paper. It was not worth anything to the students or the employers. That means there has got to be rigour for the other subjects at 16 as well.

From Kevin Brennan, the shadow education minister

Mrs Thatcher didn't abolish O-levels and CSEs without reason. It was because they actually stopped pupils from being able to fulfil their potential and sorted them out at far too young an age and I think that Michael Gove is in danger really of completely ripping up a system actually that works quite well but that does need to be looked at and reformed.

The Treasury minister David Gauke has welcomed Jimmy Carr's decision to pull out of the K2 tax avoidance scheme and urged other people involved in it to do the same.

This is what he told BBC News.

I welcome what Jimmy Carr has said. I think it's the right step for him to take. All the focus has been on him. But of course there are many people who have invested in these schemes that are very artificial and contrived. They are clearly not in accordance with the intention of parliament and they are not fair on the general taxpayer who has to pay more as a consequence. I hope others who have invested in such schemes, who maybe thought ""Well, it's a great opportunity to reduce my tax bill"", also think carefully about it, think whether it is fair, whether it is right that they do so.

Here's some Twitter reaction to the Jimmy Carr announcement.

""Breaking"" (as they say, rather irritatingly, on Twitter). The comedian Jimmy Carr has raised the white flag. Around 16 hours after David Cameron said his involvement in the K2 tax avoidance scheme was ""morally wrong"", he used his Twitter feed to say he was pulling out of it. Here are the key tweets.

I appreciate as a comedian, people will expect me to 'make light' of this situation, but I'm not going to in this statement as this is obviously a serious matter. I met with a financial advisor and he said to me ""Do you want to pay less tax? It's totally legal."" I said ""Yes."" I now realise I've made a terrible error of judgement. Although I've been advised the K2 Tax scheme is entirely legal, and has been fully disclosed to HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs), I'm no longer involved in it and will in future conduct my financial affairs much more responsibly. Apologies to everyone. Jimmy Carr

Good for him. I'll be covering the reaction to this, as well as looking at the other big story this morning, the Daily Mail's revelation that Michael Gove wants to scrap GCSEs. And then, at about 2pm, we've got a rare press conference with David Cameron. He's giving it with the Burmese opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, but I fear it won't last long because as soon as the questions get tricky, Cameron will say she's got to head off for her speech to parliament (at 3pm).

The draft, written in September and seen by the Observer, shows there are serious and entrenched divisions over the longstanding US-led policy promoting prohibition as an exclusive solution to the problem.

Instead, a number of countries are pushing for the ""war on drugs"" to be seen in a different light, which places greater emphasis on treating drug consumption as a public health problem, rather than a criminal justice matter.

It is rare for such a document to leak. Normally only the final agreed version is published once all differences between UN member states have been removed.

The divisions highlighted in the draft are potentially important. The document will form the basis of a joint ""high-level"" statement on drugs to be published in the spring, setting out the UN's thinking. This will then pave the way for a general assembly review, an event that occurs every 10 years, and, in 2016, will confirm the UN's position for the next decade. ""The idea that there is a global consensus on drugs policy is fake,"" said Damon Barrett, deputy director of the charity Harm Reduction International. ""The differences have been there for a long time, but you rarely get to see them. It all gets whittled down to the lowest common denominator, when all you see is agreement. But it's interesting to see now what they are arguing about.""

The current review, taking place in Vienna at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, comes after South American countries threw down the gauntlet to the US at this year's Organisation of American States summit meeting, when they argued that alternatives to prohibition must be considered.

Countries such as Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico have become increasingly critical of the UN's prohibition stance, claiming that maintaining the status quo plays into the hands of the cartels and paramilitary groups.

The draft reveals that Ecuador is pushing the UN to include a statement that recognises that the world needs to look beyond prohibition. Its submission claims there is ""a need for more effective results in addressing the world drug problem"" that will encourage ""deliberations on different approaches that could be more efficient and effective"".

Venezuela is pushing for the draft to include a new understanding of ""the economic implications of the current dominating health and law enforcement approach in tackling the world drug problem"", arguing that the current policy fails to recognise the ""dynamics of the drug criminal market"".

Experts said the level of disagreement showed fault lines were opening up in the globally agreed position on drug control. ""Heavy reliance on law enforcement for controlling drugs is yielding a poor return on investment and leading to all kinds of terrible human rights abuses,"" said Kasia Malinowska-Sempruch, director of the Open Society Global Drug Policy Program. ""The withdrawal from the most repressive parts of the drug war has begun – locally, nationally and globally.""

Attacking the status quo is not confined to South American countries, however. Norway wants the draft to pose ""questions related to decriminalisation and a critical assessment of the approach represented by the so-called war on drugs"". Switzerland wants the draft to recognise the consequences of the current policy on public health issues. It wants it to include the observation that member states ""note with concern that consumption prevalence has not been reduced significantly and that the consumption of new psychoactive substances has increased in most regions of the world"". It also wants the draft to ""express concern that according to UNAids, the UN programme on HIV/Aids, the global goal of reducing HIV infections among people who inject drugs by 50% by 2015 will not be reached, and that drug-related transmission is driving the expansion of the epidemic in many countries"".

The EU is also pushing hard for the draft to emphasise the need for drug-dependence treatment and care options for offenders as an alternative to incarceration.

""Drug users should be entitled to access to treatment, essential medicines, care and related support services,"" the EU's submission suggests. ""Programmes related to recovery and social reintegration should also be encouraged.""

Ann Fordham, executive director of the International Drug Policy Consortium, said the draft revealed there was growing tension over the global drugs policy. ""We are starting to see member states break with the consensus about how we should control drugs in the world. Punishment hasn't worked. All the money spent on crop eradication hasn't had the impact we would like to see.""","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The chairman of the public inquiry into the 2003 conflict said the former prime minister had however been “emotionally truthful” in his account of events leading up to the war, meaning he relied on both emotion and fact.

Breaking his long silence on the matter in an interview with the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, Chilcot said: “Tony Blair is always and ever an advocate. He makes the most persuasive case he can. Not departing from the truth but persuasion is everything.”

Chilcot was later asked if Blair was as truthful with him and the public as he should have been during the seven-year inquiry.

He replied: “Can I slightly reword that to say I think any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don’t believe that was the case in the Iraq instance.”

A spokesman for Blair told the BBC that “all these issues” had been dealt with.

Chilcot’s report, published in July last year, found that the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein posed “no imminent threat” at the time of the invasion of his country in 2003, and the war was fought on the basis of “flawed” intelligence. It found that the cabinet’s decision to invade was made in circumstances that were “far from satisfactory”.

While giving evidence to the inquiry, Blair denied he had taken the country to war on the basis of a lie over Hussein’s supposed weapons of mass destruction.

Asked in the BBC interview if he felt Blair had given the fullest version of events to the inquiry, Chilcot said: “I think he gave an – what was – I hesitate to say this, rather, but I think it was, from his perspective and standpoint, emotionally truthful and I think that came out also in his press conference after the launch statement.

“I think he was under – as you said just now – very great emotional pressure during those sessions … He was suffering. He was deeply engaged. Now in that state of mind and mood you fall back on your instinctive skills and reactions, I think.”

He agreed the questioning sessions with Blair had been “extraordinarily intense”.

Chilcot also revealed he was given just eight minutes to decide if he wanted to lead the Iraq inquiry. “I knew that I could do it in a way that would not be the same as other inquiries which had proved problematic, frankly, in their procedure,” he said.

Asked how his would be different, Chilcot replied: “I was really clear from the outset, even before the parliamentary statement by Gordon Brown on the Monday, that it shouldn’t be an accusatory inquiry, it should be an inquiry into the facts, the history, in effect.”

Chilcot defended the length of the inquiry: “There was so much stuff. It was a history of, in effect, starting in 2001, of eight to nine years of diplomatic, military, political resource, every sort of aspect.”

David Cameron pressured him to speed up the inquiry, Chilcot said, “which I think would have been unforgivable, a terrible waste of a lot of time and effort and truth”.

Asked how Cameron communicated, he said: “Essentially messages via the cabinet secretary or senior Cabinet Office staff, and then eventually public correspondence. Which I had no difficulty in replying to politely. Firmness and politeness are different things.”

Maj Gen Tim Cross, who advised Blair on the invasion of Iraq, said it was significant that Chilcot suggested emotion swayed Blair’s decision to go to war.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “Sir John didn’t say that he [Blair] did not tell the truth, but obviously his emotions had a big impact on his decision-making process.”

Asked whether Blair’s emotions intervened with rational decision-making, he said: “I’m sure it did. When I met Tony Blair in Kosovo, when my brigade ran refugee camps, he literally wept in the tents with the refugees.”

He added: “Sir John reaffirmed in this interview that one of his criticisms was that this was not last resort, one of the just war criteria.



“When I briefed Tony Blair it was quite clear that he felt that this was a necessity, that there was a just cause, that we had to do something about this. My own sense is that he wasn’t that far short, if he was short.

“I have no problem with the fact that in the end we did away with Saddam Hussein. I watched the mass graves being dug up in Iraq. This was a nasty, brutal dictator.”

A spokesperson for Tony Blair said of the interview: “The BBC headline stems from words put into John Chilcot’s mouth by the interviewer. A full reading of the interview shows that Sir John makes clear that Mr Blair had not ‘departed from the truth’.

“Sir John also makes clear that on the eve of the invasion Mr Blair asked the then chair of the joint intelligence committee: ‘Can you tell me beyond any reasonable doubt that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction?’ To which the answer was: ‘Yes I can.’ He was entitled to rely on that.

“Five different inquiries have all shown the same thing: that there was no falsifying of the intelligence.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

It is an evangelical, revolutionary idea (once hailed as “the capitalist road to communism”) but it is deluded and diversionary. The Compass scheme does set out how to pay for a partial basic income for all: a rise in all income tax rates of 5p, the abolition of the personal tax allowance and the extension of national insurance contributions to all employees. These will raise the bulk of the £210bn gross cost. What is achieved? A big cut in child poverty, yes, but tiny falls in pensioner and working age adult poverty, despite the latter being the basic goal of the policy. And the numbers reliant on means-testing will be cut by only one-fifth.

Thus a powerful new tax engine will pull along a tiny cart (a partial and inadequate basic income). Why bother? The underlying belief or dream is that basic income will provide a mobilising theme to bring about radical change. There is no evidence anywhere in the world for this. Similar proposals have been made every few years for the last 50 years and they have got nowhere (and I do not mention Switzerland).

The problem is that it combines a radical vision with a naive or insouciant view of politics. Like all big-bang solutions it ignores contexts, politics and transitions. Somehow the fact that it is also advocated by neoliberals and Silicon Valley libertarians is seen as a plus.

I fear that this latest plan will drain the energies of the left in social policy and will divert attention from so many other worthwhile policy alternatives: the living wage, boosting trade unionism, free childcare, radical changes in housing policy, policies to reduce working time to limit turbo-consumption, green investment and so on.

Professor Ian Gough

LSE

Your Monday edition (6 June) contained two related articles. The idea that Labour is looking at introducing a universal basic income (Labour may back free basic income for all) can be linked to the findings that the approach of the benefit cap, essentially to incentivise people to take wage work through forced penury, is deeply flawed (Welfare curbs hit chances of unemployed finding jobs – study). While there are many difficult questions raised by the universal basic income (for instance, how might the additional costs faced by disabled people be addressed on top of it), the fact that it is premised upon the notion of citizenship, rather than the relationship of individuals to wage work, has the potential to deal a fatal blow to the orthodox economic account that suggests people will not work unless forced to do so through poverty. An acceptance of the universal basic income, however, will have to be accompanied by a cultural shift that acknowledges that it is perfectly legitimate for people not to do wage work, while also receiving an unconditional collectivised form of support. This issue is equally significant to the costs of the universal basic income as the idea that wage work should be the aim of all working-age people is deeply ingrained in cultural and political life, and has been used to justify cuts to out-of-work benefits that are currently doing so much harm in Britain.

Dr Chris Grover

Senior lecturer in social policy, Law School, Lancaster university

So, John McDonnell has admitted to finding attraction in a citizen’s income. The Guardian’s editorial response is that he deserves credit for daring to dance with big ideas, that he should proceed with caution and get the details right. I suggest that a better Guardian response might have been to point out that if we were to return to an effective progressive taxation regime such that there is an extra £50 per person per week, on average, being fed into the system, then instead of simply doling it back out to everybody we might be able use it to fund a proper and accessible public transport system, abolish student tuition fees and restore maintenance grants, stop closing down libraries and swimming pools, maintain our public parks and sweep the streets, employ more nurses in the NHS, give teachers a better deal, build council houses, properly fund a supportive police service, employ more coastguard personnel, care for the mentally ill, etc. There is potential employment in a fully functioning supportive and civilised society, all could work and all could be paid for doing so. The citizen’s income should never be considered seriously as a Labour party manifesto item. The party doesn’t need to “dream big”: it shouldn’t be dreaming at all, it needs to wake up and look at the real issues.

Peter Dunne

Your editorial on 7 June, the Compass report to be launched by John McDonnell and the failure of the Swiss referendum (Swiss voters reject proposal to give basic income to every adult and child, theguardian.com, 5 June) highlight the problem with current universal basic income (UBI) proposals: either they are not generous enough to achieve the aim of replacing wages in an increasingly automated world; or they are not funded properly (the Swiss referendum); or both (the Compass report). The only politically acceptable and sustainable way to fund UBI is for governments to take control of the money supply and issue social credit. (QED wasn’t funded by tax increases.) You’d need sensible border controls, too – at least until it’s global.

Chris Hughes

Heather Stewart reports that “Labour may back free basic income for all” (6 June). This is a potentially attractive alternative to mass poverty, but, if we don’t produce products to spend this basic income on, inflation would quickly wipe out any expected benefits. The idea of a free basic income is evidence both that capitalism does not work and that socialism offers no viable alternative. The established rational connection between earnings and income is being eroded. We need to replace both capitalism and socialism with an agreed principle of global management and, as the referendum is demonstrating, our political parties need scrapping and replacing with a less confrontational process of finding a place for all elements of society. Setting the poor against the rich always ends in civil war.

Martin London

Henllan, Denbighshire

All of the Compass paper’s calculations are predicated on changes to taxes and benefits having zero effect on labour supply decisions. Aside from being wildly implausible, such an analysis removes the key benefit of a UBI, that, if properly constructed, it increases labour supply, particularly among low-income households. The existing system creates a “benefits trap” where the removal/tapering of benefits means that the effective marginal tax rate can be astronomical on low incomes. By making benefits payments unconditional on income or employment status, a UBI solves this problem, bringing people back into the labour force.

The paper also proposes preserving all of the complications of the existing tax and benefit system. These both make it hard to administer, and mean that individuals cannot readily calculate how a change in their situation will change their tax liability. The presence of a UBI would enable us to drastically simplify things, with a switch to a flat income tax that would also replace national insurance. The system would still be progressive overall, thanks to the UBI payment being far more significant for people at the bottom of the income scale.

UBI would also enable us to increase VAT in a progressive way. In particular, a rise in the UBI level funded by a rise in VAT would leave those at the bottom of the distribution unambiguously better off. While reporting often focuses on wealth or income inequality, these are undesirable only to the extent to which they lead to consumption inequality, which VAT tackles directly.

In the past, UBI has been advocated by figures across the political spectrum. It is vital that the progressive centre reclaim this idea before it becomes permanently tied to outdated views from the far left.

As a lifelong democratic socialist I’m dismayed by this idea. Yes, technological change is job threatening. But the answer is 1) a welfare state tailored towards people’s needs, not uniformity, 2) more private sector jobs, and 3) new categories of public sector work in the face of urgent social, environmental and security needs. UBI is a cop-out. It’s not redistributive. If generous enough to ensure a decent living standard for the less well-off, it would reduce the urge to seek work, at least for some. It would unnecessarily help the better-off while hugely diverting resources from other public goods. Large numbers are likely to resent a wholesale abandonment of reciprocity and the contributory principle. The ethical bias is towards libertarian individualism, not solidarity.

I was in Zurich the day following the referendum on a basic guaranteed income and the reaction in the local press (Tages Anzeiger) was markedly different from yours. Despite the 76.9% nein vote, the losing side felt that they had made a significant advance in their cause as part of a fruitful opening up of an issue with important future implications. The paper noted that most of the support came from younger voters. Your phrase “the visionaries crashed to an overwhelming defeat” may be correct, viewed statistically, but the newspaper gave the clear opinion that this was only the first engagement in a long-term, important campaign. Even the fact that the reform’s supporters disagreed on some of the detail did not detract from this view. Since referendums are a regular event in Swiss political life, this vote does not mean that the matter is closed. The democratic debate continues. If only our body politic would engage so directly with us, the electorate.

The files are being kept at a secret archive at a high-security government communications centre in Buckinghamshire, north of London, where they occupy mile after mile of shelving.

Most of the papers are many decades old – some were created in the 19th century – and document in fine detail British foreign relations throughout two world wars, the cold war, withdrawal from empire and entry into the common market.

They have been kept from public view in breach of the Public Records Acts, which requires that all government documents become public once they are 30 years old – a term about to be reduced to 20 years – unless the department has received permission from the lord chancellor to hold them for longer. The secret archive is also beyond the reach of the Freedom of Information Act.

The Foreign Office is not the only government department that has been unlawfully hoarding files. This month the Guardian disclosed that the Ministry of Defence was unlawfully holding more than 66,000 historic files at a warehouse in Derbyshire, including thousands of files from the army's Northern Ireland headquarters.

However, the Foreign Office's secret archive, which is estimated to hold around 1.2m files and occupies around 15 miles of floor-to-ceiling shelving, is believed to be far larger than the combined undisclosed archives of every other government department. One of Britain's leading historians describes its size as ""staggering"".

A basic inventory of the hidden archive gives a clue to its enormousness: batches of files are catalogued according to the length of shelf space they occupy, with six metres and two centimetres dedicated to files about Rhodesia, for example, and four metres and 57 centimetres holding files about Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, the KGB spies who operated inside the Foreign Office and MI6. There are 50 metres of files on Hong Kong, 100.81 metres about the United States and 97.84 metres of ""private office papers"".

No length is given in the inventory for other categories such as Colonial Office files or records from the permanent under-secretary's department, the point of liaison between the Foreign Office and MI6.

The inventory says there is one bag of records from the Foreign Office's now notorious cold war propaganda unit, the Information Research Department. And buried away within the archive, wedged between files from the British military government in post-war Germany and lists of consular officials, are papers about the treaty of Paris, which concluded the Crimean war in 1856.

The Foreign Office's realisation that it would eventually need to admit to the existence of such a vast repository appears to have come at a time when its lawyers were waging a court battle with a group of elderly Kenyans. It was a battle that it eventually lost, with the result that it was obliged to issue an unprecedented apology and pay millions of pounds in compensation to thousands of men and women who suffered severe mistreatment during the 1950s Mau Mau insurgency.

During those proceedings the Foreign Office repeatedly denied the existence of a much smaller secret archive of 8,800 colonial-era documents, known as the migrated archive. It was eventually obliged to admit that this did exist, and that its contents corroborated the Kenyans' allegations about widespread acts of murder and torture by the colonial authorities.

As a first step, the Foreign Office gave its colossal secret a name, the Special Collections. Then last November the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, was asked to sign a blanket authorisation that is said to have placed the retention of the files on a legal footing for 12 months. No announcement was made.

Finally, a written statement about ""public records"" by the Foreign Office minister David Lidington was quietly issued in the Commons on a Friday afternoon. The statement included two sentences that referred to a ""large accumulation"" of documents.

As a result of the manner in which the matter was handled, the existence of the archive has remained all but unknown, even among historians. Anthony Badger, the Cambridge history professor who has been overseeing the declassification of the migrated archive, has written that he believes ""it is difficult to overestimate the legacy of suspicion among historians, lawyers and journalists"" that resulted from the concealment of those 8,800 files.

The discovery that the colonial-era documents are just a very small part of a hidden archive of more than a million files is certain to cause enormous damage to the Foreign Office's reputation among historians and others. A Foreign Office spokesperson said the archive had accumulated over time and that ""resources have not been available to review and prepare"" them for release.

The handful of historians who have become aware of the archive are deeply sceptical about this claim, however. Richard Drayton, Rhodes professor of imperial history at King's College London, said the size of the hidden archive was staggering, and it was ""scandalous"" that papers of such significance could be concealed for such a long time. ""It's a working archive, for a department which believes it has a long-term, historic interest in many parts of the world,"" he said.

It was unclear whether there is any ""truly explosive"" material within the files, Drayton said, or whether officials were attempting to manage the country's historic reputation. ""It may be that from the perspective of the state, 50 years is a short time. But the idea that the British state today has an obligation to protect the reputation of the British state of 50 years ago seems to me wholly inappropriate. It would be a manipulation of history, which we associate with iron curtain regimes during the cold war, regimes that managed and controlled the past.""

Mandy Banton, senior research fellow at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, said it was ""extremely likely"" that the archive had been culled to remove material that would most damage the reputation of the UK and the Foreign Office. Banton, a Colonial Office records expert who worked at National Archives at Kew, south-west London, for 25 years, said she had been ""very angry"" when she discovered that the migrated archives had been withheld. ""I would have been incandescent had I learned while still working there. In lying to me, the Foreign Office forced me to mislead my readers.""

Freedom of information campaigners believe that the hoarding of such a huge amount of papers is symptomatic of a culture of secrecy and retention at the Foreign Office and across many other UK government departments. Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, an NGO that works to ensure the Freedom of Information Act is properly implemented, said: ""The FoI system depends on people knowing what they hold and being transparent about what they hold.""

The archive is kept at Hanslope Park, a sprawling Foreign Office and MI6 outstation in the heart of the Buckinghamshire countryside. Sometimes referred to by Foreign Office staff as ""Up North"" – although it is only 60 miles north of London – Hanslope Park is also home to Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre, a facility where hundreds of government scientists and technicians develop sophisticated counter-espionage measures.

They include measures intended to protect the UK government and its allies from the sort of surveillance that Edward Snowden's leaks have shown to have been perfected by the National Security Agency and Britain's GCHQ.

Two wire fences, one 10ft high and topped with razor wire, encircle the cluster of buildings at Hanslope Park. Between them is a no man's land with intruder alarms. CCTV cameras are positioned every few yards and the entire perimeter is covered by floodlights. Inside, posters on the walls carry the half-joking warning: ""Careless talk costs jobs.""

Curiously, many of the offices are said to house row after row of typewriters rather than computers, with incinerators at the end of each room for the disposal of typewriter ribbons – a measure to reduce electromagnetic emissions, which can travel for hundreds of yards and be deciphered by foreign governments.

Hanslope Park is not only a highly secure facility, it is also a place that appears to be accustomed to handling – and destroying – large amounts of paperwork. This, possibly, explains why the special collections have been held there.

The blanket authorisation signed by Grayling put the secret archive on a legal footing for 12 months, during which time the Foreign Office is expected to devise a plan for its declassification and transfer to Kew. A spokesperson said a plan would be presented next month to a committee that advises the National Archives and the Ministry of Justice.

It will be quite a task. Declassification of the migrated archive has taken two and a half years, with the final tranche of documents due to arrive at Kew next month. At that rate, clearing up the special collections would take around 340 years.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

In an unusual on-the-record denunciation, a Downing Street spokesman said the claims about Cummings’ viewpoint, made in a Sunday Times article, had not been put to No 10 in advance and contained “invented” quotes.

The report claimed that at one private event at the end of February, Cummings outlined then government’s strategy at the time in a way that was summarised by some present as “herd immunity, protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad.”

The allegations, which have been widely shared online, connect with wider criticisms that the government response to the virus was initially too weak, based on a notion that rather than limiting its spread, enough people could be allowed to contract it to give population-wide “herd immunity”.

While the phrase “herd immunity” was used by government figures such as Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, No 10 has denied it was ever a tactic. However, the use of the phrase illustrated initial tensions within government over how to balance the economic impact of a full national lockdown against the potential number of deaths from the virus.

According to the Sunday Times report, the key moment came on 12 March when a group of government experts gathered to examine modelling of the spread of the virus carried out by academics at Imperial College London and elsewhere.

This predicted that if no action was taken more than half a million people would die, and that even some limited mitigation efforts would only halve this. The Sunday Times report said this changed the mind of Cummings, who before had been an adherent of the herd immunity idea.

After the 12 March meeting, Cummings changed his view and became one of the strongest advocates in government for tough restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, the Sunday Times said. It quoted one anonymous senior Conservative as saying: “He’s gone from ‘herd immunity and let the old people die’ to ‘let’s shut down the country and the economy’.”

The Downing Street spokesman said: “This is a highly defamatory fabrication which was not put to No 10 by the Sunday Times before publication. The article also includes a series of apparent quotes from meetings which are invented.”

Cummings is already a controversial figure within government. The former Vote Leave strategist is regularly portrayed as an ideologue and hidden power over Johnson.

In January, Cummings’ call for “misfits and weirdos” to work in No 10 led to the appointment of Andrew Sabisky, who soon had to step down because of previously stated views on subjects ranging from black people’s IQs to whether benefits claimants should be encouraged to have fewer children.

It later emerged that in his own prior writings, Cummings had suggested that the NHS should cover the cost of selecting babies to have higher IQs.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

According to the Times, Oliver Dowden described the supplies as “analogue capabilities that it makes sense to retain” in a digital age during a visit to Porton Down, the UK’s military laboratory.

Dowden made the visit to coincide with his first annual risk and resilience statement, which he had promised to give last year when launching the government’s UK resilience framework.

As part of the statement, he announced the launch of a national “resilience academy” to help people and businesses prepare for future pandemics, natural disasters and cyber-attacks.

The deputy prime minister announced the plans in the House of Commons, claiming the academy would help the “whole of society” prepare for the risks.

Dowden listed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, cyber-attacks, pandemics, the misuse of artificial intelligence and extreme weather among some of the risks the UK faces.

He said businesses would be offered training to deal with the impact of such threats, while a new website will provide the public with “practical advice” on how to be better prepared for future risks.

He told the Commons: “The government has a role in bringing all actors together and to give them the skills they need. Today, I can announce we are developing a new UK resilience academy that will improve the skills of those groups.

“It will provide a range of learning and training opportunities for the whole of society. For professionals, there will be a curriculum to build skills, knowledge and networks, and a centre for excellence for exercising. For businesses, there will be greater guidance and particularly assistance on threats to critical national infrastructure and cyber.

“And for citizens, there will be a unified government resilience website, which will provide practical advice on how households can prepare as part of a campaign to raise awareness of the simple steps individuals can take to raise their resilience.”

Dowden also said the government would develop a volunteer hub aimed at helping authorities draw on a single pool of volunteers who want to help in future events similar to the Covid pandemic, which he said “demonstrated the overwhelming community spirit” of the UK.

The Labour frontbencher Pat McFadden welcomed the measures but asked what the government was doing to bolster resilience in energy supplies and the “public estate”, as well as in elections.

He said: “Why is it that the government’s new policy is to roll back on the transition mandated by its own legislation for net zero, and prolong a reliance on international fossil fuel markets? For these failures, the British public has paid a heavy price.

“And how will the government increase resilience in the public estate? Schools’ capital budgets cut back under this prime minister’s watch while he was chancellor. School roofs falling in, disrupting children’s education.”

He also pressed ministers to implement recommendations of parliament’s intelligence and security committee, aimed at preventing Russia and other states from interfering with upcoming elections.

McFadden said: “With an election coming some time in the next year, I am sure the secretary of state would agree that we need to do all we can to ensure it is conducted in a free and fair manner.”

The deputy prime minister reminded the Commons that an election could be held in January 2025 at the latest.

The 449 attendees at last year’s Thameside event on 24 June had a combined wealth in excess of £11bn, with elite diners sitting at tables costing up to £12,000 each to rub shoulders with David Cameron, Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson, as well as the secretaries of state for health, transport, culture and justice.

Six billionaires and 15 people with a personal wealth above £100m were present at the closed event at Old Billingsgate Market, including 73 financiers, 47 retail and property tycoons, 10 in oil, gas and mining and 19 working in public affairs and PR, documents seen by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Guardian reveal.

Disclosure of last year’s guest list – which the party intended to remain private – comes just ahead of this year’s fundraiser, which will take place on Wednesday night at the Hurlingham private members’ club in west London.

The precise amount raised from the 2013 event cannot be quantified, but Electoral Commission filings show that since the ball those present have donated a total £5m, £1.1m of which was registered in the week after the event. Table sales raised at least £250,000, with the cheaper tickets going for £400 a time.

The main sponsor was Shore Capital, a Mayfair boutique investment bank led by Howard Shore, who has donated £450,000 to the Conservatives personally and through associated companies.

Shore booked three so-called “premier tables”, on one of which he hosted David and Samantha Cameron. Others on the prime minister’s tables included Nicolas Berggruen, an investor known as the “homeless billionaire” because he lives in hotels around the world; Darko Horvat, a Slovenian tycoon; and the property grandee Sir John Ritblat. In a statement, Shore’s company said: “Shore Capital supported the event and made a financial contribution as they believe that the Conservative party, led by the prime minister, are the best party to govern the country.”

One of the most surprising guests was Vladimir Putin’s judo partner, Vasily Shestakov, who was introduced to the prime minister. The Russian president’s key aide had been tasked with improving Russia’s reputation in the UK and the handshake was “to make the wheels go round”, a member of the Russian’s party said.

Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, shared a table with Andrei Borodin, an exiled Russian banker who is wanted by the Kremlin to face charges of “aggravated swindling” over an alleged £220m bank fraud, which he denies and claims is politically driven. Borodin said: “I participated in no conversation on policy or party funding issues, nor did I make any donation at the event.”

Some glamour was provided by the presence of Peter Stringfellow, 73, the founder of the nightclub that bears his name, and his 31-year-old wife, Bella. A former Goldman Sachs banker and onetime Conservative donor, Richard Sharp, who sits on the Bank of England’s independent finance policy committee, was also present.

Press were banned from the event and helpers were “absolutely forbidden” from leaking details to the media, the internal documents show.

One former political regulator said that the details raise fresh questions about the UK party funding system. “These events are not transparent at all,” said Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life. “They are made to be private, cosy affairs where you pay for attention from a senior political figure, and if you are seeking to influence the government, you might have the opportunity to do so. We are vulnerable as a country to people getting private access to ministers for not too much money.”

A spokesman for the Conservative party said: “All donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with Electoral Commission rules.”

The home secretary was placed with Lord de la Warr, director of Cluff Natural Resources, which is exploring underground coal gassification in Warwickshire, as well as Wafic Said, the Syrian-Saudi businessman who helped broker the al-Yamamah arms deal.

Among the lobbyists – some of whom have represented clients as diverse as the wife of the Syrian president Asma al-Assad, the Philip Morris tobacco company and Yukos oil – was James Henderson, chief executive of public affairs firm Bell Pottinger, which represents fracking company Cuadrilla among others. He hosted a table for friends, while his colleague Patsy Baker joined a table with justice secretary Chris Grayling.

“We do not go there to lobby ministers in any form,” Henderson said. “We go there to support the party. Apart from shaking a hand, I don’t believe I have ever spoken to a minister at any of these events.”

The summer party is the Conservatives’ second largest fundraiser after the winter “black and white ball”. Altogether, guests at the event have donated an estimated £22m to the Conservative party since records began in 2001, either in a private capacity and through companies of which they are directors.

On one table were representatives of the little-known Tory dining club, United and Cecil. Since 2001, its members have donated over £900,000 to the party through the club, without individuals being named.

The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, shared a table with the Saudi Arabian head of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce, Afnan Al-Shuaiby; the table was paid for by Lord Clanwilliam, a PR adviser who works for the government of Bahrain, which has faced criticism over its human rights record. Clanwilliam declined to comment.

The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, was entertained by shipping to aviation magnate Constantine Logothetis, who has personally and through his company given £128,500 to the party. Also at the table was Laurent Cadji, another shipping company director. He did not respond to a request for comment.

Russian connection: Vasily Shestakov, Putin's judo partner

One of the most intriguing tables at the dinner features several prominent Russians connected to the Kremlin, including Vladimir Putin's wealthy judo partner.

Vasily Shestakov, an influential MP in Russia's Duma, sat a table hosted by the PR executive David Burnside. Shestakov is an old friend of Putin's and the co-author with Russia's president of several books on the sport, including Learn Judo With Vladimir Putin and Judo: History, Theory, Practice.

But Shestakov is also a key player in the Kremlin's recent multi-pronged attempts to improve the country's battered international image. Shestakov has been given the job of boosting Russia's reputation in the UK. He is head of FIAS, the international federation for sambo, a Russian variation of judo.

At the dinner, Burnside introduced Shestakov to David Cameron. A photo on the sambo federation's website shows Cameron chatting to Putin's close friend, with Alex Nekrassov – who works for Burnside's PR consultancy firm New Century Media – translating. Also pictured is Andrei Kliamko, a FIAS executive with business interests in Crimea, who according to Forbes Russia is worth $1.9bn.

Burnside is a former Ulster Unionist MP, whose communications consultancy firm specialises in assisting wealthy Russians. ""Cameron knows David from his political days,"" Tim Lewin, who sat with Shestakov, and advises New Century Media, said. ""Cameron was looking for people to meet and greet. David grabbed him and introduced him to Shestakov.""

Asked whether the meeting was appropriate, given the 2006 murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London by suspected Kremlin agents, Lewin said: ""Shestakov is a senior MP."" He added: ""It's no different in my world, the finance world. If you want to impress people you have to introduce them to other big swingers. If you can have him [Shestakov] shake hands with the PM, it makes the wheels go round.""

In May 2013 Shestakov – who speaks no English – was made an honorary freeman of the City of London. In June Shestakov hosted a sambo event at Kensington Palace, where he read out a message from Russia's president. Attendees included Prince Michael of Kent, Lord Simon Reading – also at Burnside's table – and a Russian business delegation. A friend of Silvio Berlusconi's paid for the evening and banquet.

Positive Russia charm offensive

The same month, June 2013, Lewin and Burnside founded the Positive Russia Foundation, an organisation designed to improve Russia's image in the UK. Lewin insists the foundation was his idea. According to Russian press reports, however, Shestakov was closely involved in setting up Positive Russia. Its purpose was to combat ""anti-Russian propaganda"" in the British media, Shestakov said.

The soft power project is the latest in a series of initiatives by the Russian government, which include the Kremlin propaganda channel Russia Today (RT). RT vehemently criticises the west, while ignoring the Russian state's authoritarianism. The St Petersburg news website Fontanka.ru – which interviewed Shestakov – described Positive Russia ""as a new variant of RT, but under the patronage of English aristocrats.""

According to Lewin, Burnside had also hoped to win a lucrative contract to promote sambo in the UK. In October 2013, ""following conversations with Mr Shestakov"", his company offered to arrange and promote a major sambo tournament in London. The 2014 event – named the President's Cup after Putin – would launch the sport on the world stage and ""set a benchmark"" for future UK-Russian relations.

New Century Media envisaged Putin handing the cup to the winning sambo team as well as a ""prestigious black tie evening reception"" afterwards. The PR firm promised ""high-level dignitaries"" from both countries would attend, including David Cameron, members of the royal family and Russian and British ministers. The venue would be Old Billingsgate Market.

The pitch explained: ""Now one of Europe's most prestigious event venues, it hosts a variety of events throughout the year, including the Conservative Party's Summer Party, where Mr Shestakov was introduced to Prime Minister David Cameron this year by New Century Chairman David Burnside."" The event would help rebuild Russian-UK ties, following ""a slew of negative media coverage"". The proposed budget, including Burnside's fee, was £1.5m. Lewin told the Guardian last week the contract ""didn't go anywhere"". But court papers show that New Century Media was earning huge sums during the same period from other wealthy Russian clients. It was also promoting Moscow, at the behest of Kremlin officials, as an international financial centre. One of the clients, Vladimir Makhlay, a businessman who fled to the UK in 2005, agreed to pay New Century Media £75,000 a month for strategic advice – ""including support for Mr Makhlay's application for a British passport"". Makhlay was allowed into Britain on an investor visa because he had ""at least £1m"" in British assets, the high court was told.

In return for £75,000 a month Burnside offered various services including ""reputation management"" and ""personal introductions to an influential network of contacts"". Makhlay, however, stopped paying after four months. New Century Media then sued in the high court, arguing successfully that the Russian had signed a year-long deal. According to election commission records, New Century Media donated £91,000 to the Conservative party in 2009 and 2010.

'This explains Cameron's spinelessness in relation to Putin'

The Guardian has learned that Burnside invited a senior diplomat from the Russian embassy in London to the same Tory fundraising dinner in 2012. The diplomat, Sergei Nalobin, is the son of a top-ranking officer in the FSB, the successor agency to the Soviet KGB. Nalobin's father was Litvinenko's boss in the 1990s.

""Nalobin wasn't supposed to be there. He was a last-minute addition. He spent the evening going round the tables, handing his business card to government ministers,"" one source said.

Nalobin played a key behind-the-scenes role in setting up the Conservative Friends of Russia, a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group. But the group collapsed in 2012, with key Conservative MPs resigning, following revelations of Nalobin's close links to Russia's powerful spy agencies.

Last week Lewin said the Positive Russia Foundation was still going – despite the sharp decline in Moscow-London relations following Russia's annexation of Crimea this spring. Although Cameron has condemned Russian aggression in Ukraine, Downing Street has so far not imposed visa bans on top Kremlin officials and oligarchs, many of whom have properties in London. Critics say the government is reluctant to act because it fears offending the City, for whom rich Russians are an important business.

Labour MP Chris Bryant, former chairman of the all-party parliamentary Russia group, said on Tuesday: ""This shows the utter hypocrisy of David Cameron's Tory party and explains Cameron's spinelessness in relation to Putin. Voters will think that it's not just bizarre but despicable that Cameron will shake hands with, sit down to dinner with, and quite possibly take the money off, people such as these – the very people he is pretending to criticise over Crimea.""

Burnside declined to comment. John Whittingdale MP, who sat with Shestakov on Burnside's table, said he believed that engaging with the Kremlin was the best strategy. Whittingdale, the chair of the British-Ukraine parliamentary group, said that he had a ""robust exchange of views"" last month with Russia's ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko. Lewin expressed similar sentiments. ""I think isolating any authoritarian regime only makes it more authoritarian. If they [two opposing sides] don't speak to each other they end up throwing rocks over the fence.""

Shestakov and Putin were members of St Petersburg's Yavara-Neva judo club. Many of the president's former sparring partners are now billionaires who occupy senior Kremlin positions. Shestakov declined to comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

As anger intensified over plans by oil companies to employ Portuguese and Italian workers, the prime minister said that he understood people's concerns.

Asked whether the prime minister regretted using the controversial phrase, branded illegal and racist by critics, his spokesman in London said: ""I don't see any reason for regret. The action that we have taken has meant that we are now putting in place measures that ensure British workers can have access to the vacancies in the system.""

Some of the workers who walked out at refineries and power stations in various parts of the UK held placards quoting the prime minister's words. The wildcat strikes mark the latest in a series of protests over the use of foreign rather than domestic labour by large companies.

Asked about the situation in Davos, Brown said: ""I understand people's worries about their jobs. I understand people's anxieties about employment across the country. But we are doing everything we can both to get economic growth moving in our country and to help people who are unemployed, to help them into new jobs.""

In London, the Downing Street spokesman said the government understood that contracts for the construction work in question were awarded ""some time ago when there was a shortage of skilled labour in the UK"", and added: ""That's obviously not now the case.""

The spokesman said ministers would be ""speaking to the industry in the next few days to ensure they did all they can to help the British economy"".

Pressed on the matter, the spokesman was unable to say what meeting had been set up or with whom. He could not say which government department was leading the negotiations.

He insisted ministers were doing all they could to shore up the economy, and said: ""What we have tried to do with the points-based [immigration] system is ensure that British workers are given the opportunities that exist in the labour market first.""

More than 700 BP and Ineos workers at the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland walked out this morning after an 8am union meeting. Police were called to the Aberthaw power station near Barry, south Wales, and 400 workers at a refinery in Wilton, near Redcar, Teesside, downed tools.

In Davos, the prime minister said: ""I came into politics to help people out of unemployment, to help people who were poor by building an economy that was confident and strong to weather this storm. I believe that the action we have taken to help people in work stay in work, to help people who lose their jobs get jobs again ... is the way to do it.""

Brown said it was important for the world not to retreat into protectionism with the erection of new trade barriers in response to the global crisis.

""This form of deglobalisation, which will lead to trade protectionism if it's not stopped, is something I'm warning people about,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Let me say what a pleasure it is to be here at this discussion on our country's character, our values, our future.

I am here to listen, I am here to learn and I am here because I want to discuss with you during the course of the day what you think about being British, how important being British is to your identity, what you think characterises us as the British, what in particular could be said to be British values, what are the British values that make us proud to be British.

And I'm here to listen, because recent weeks have seen a renewed focus on what it is to be British and what we value about the British way of life:

· whether all the different countries of the union - Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland - all want to stay together, part of the union

· how we better integrate our ethnic communities and respond to migration

· how we respond to Muslim fundamentalism

· what is our role in Europe and the European constitution. And

· whether facing global challenges we need a stronger sense of national purpose.

And of course people's concern about gun crime and anti-social behaviour is also a concern about what is happening in our country today.

A few years ago less than half - 46% - identified closely with being British. But today national identity has become far more important: it is not 46% but 65% - two thirds - who now identify Britishness as important, and recent surveys show that British people feel more patriotic about their country than almost other European country.

One reason is that Britain has a unique history - and what has emerged from the long tidal flows of British history - from the 2,000 years of successive waves of invasion, immigration, assimilation and trading partnerships, from the uniquely rich, open and outward looking culture - is I believe a distinctive set of British values which influence British institutions.

Indeed a multinational state, with England, Scotland, Wales and now Northern Ireland we are a country united not so much by race or ethnicity but by shared values that have shaped shared institutions. Indeed, when people are asked what they think is important about being British many say our institutions: from the monarchy and the national anthem to the Church of England, the BBC and our sports teams.

But when people are also asked what they admire about Britain, more usually says it is our values: - British tolerance, the British belief in liberty and the British sense of fair play. Even before America said in its constitution it was the land of liberty and erected the Statue of Liberty, I think Britain can lay claim to the idea of liberty.

Out of the necessity of finding a way to live together in a multinational state came the practice of tolerance, then the pursuit of liberty and the principle of fairness to all.

Indeed Britain is a country that not only prides itself in its fairness, tolerance and what George Orwell called decency but - as we have seen in recent debates like that over the Big Brother show - wants to be defined by it, defined by being a tolerant, fair and decent country.

And there is a golden thread which runs through British history - that runs from that long-ago day in Runnymede in 1215 when arbitrary power was fully challenged with the Magna Carta, on to the first bill of rights in 1689 where Britain became the first country where parliament asserted power over the king, to the democratic reform acts - throughout the individual standing firm against tyranny and then - an even more generous, expansive view of liberty - the idea of all government accountable to the people, evolving into the exciting idea of empowering citizens to control their own lives.

Just as it was in the name of liberty that in the 1800s Britain led the world in abolishing the slave trade - something we celebrate in 2007 - so too, in the 1940s, in the name of liberty, Britain stood firm against fascism, which is why I would oppose those who say we should do less to teach that period of our history in our schools.

But, woven also into that golden thread of liberty are countless strands of common, continuing endeavour in our villages, towns and cities - the efforts and popular achievements of ordinary men and women, with one sentiment in common - a strong sense of duty.

The Britain of local pride, civic duty, civic society and the public realm. The Britain of thousands of charities, voluntary associations, craft societies but also of churches and faith groups.

And the Britain of fairness to every individual we see expressed most of all in Britain's unique national health service, health care free of charge to all who need it, founded not on ability to pay but on need - at the core of British history, the very British ideas of 'active citizenship', 'good neighbour', civic pride and the public realm.

Now for years we didn't think we needed to debate or even think in depth about what it was to be a British citizen. But I think more and more people are recognising not just how important their national identity is to them but how important it is to our country.

A strong sense of being British helps unite and unify us; it builds stronger social cohesion among communities. We know that other countries have a strong sense of national purpose, even a sense of their own destiny.

And so should we. And it helps us deal with issues as varied as what Britain does in Europe; to issues of managed migration and how we better integrate ethnic minorities. Today we have a citizenship test for newcomers wanting to be citizens - 24 questions on life in the UK that lasts for 45 minutes.

We also have citizenship ceremonies. We will soon have a stronger element teaching us about citizenship in the curriculum. But I believe when there is now so much mobility between nations and countries, when we feel strongly that being a British citizen is something to be proud of, then we should emphasise that British citizenship is about more than a test, more than a ceremony - it is a kind of contract between the citizen and the country, involving rights and responsibilities that will protect and enhance the British way of life.

Citizenship means there are common rules and accepted standards. There is now agreement with the proposition I made some time ago that for new citizens, learning English should be a requirement. New citizens should have an understanding of our history and our culture.

But in any national debate on the future of citizenship it is right to consider asking men and women seeking citizenship to undertake some community work in our country or something akin to that that introduces them to a wider range of institutions and people in our country prior to enjoying the benefits of citizenship.

Like you I'm very proud of being British; proud of British values, proud of what we contribute to the world. And like you I make to make sure that we consider today all that we can do to build an even stronger sense of national purpose which unifies us for the years to come.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Researchers have detected a network of online “fascist fitness” chat groups on the messaging app Telegram with a large number directly linked to the neo-Nazi Patriotic Alternative, Britain’s biggest extreme right group.

European and US fight groups are regularly glorified in these groups, including the white supremacist Rise Above Movement (RAM), notorious for having four members arrested in 2018 for inciting and participating in violence against anti-racist protesters.

Among the UK groups to laud RAM is the White Stag Athletic Club (WSAC), whose members post images of swastika flags, and celebrated the acquittal last November of Kyle Rittenhouse, who shot dead two anti-racist protesters in Wisconsin in 2020.

At-home fitness boomed during the pandemic with some digital fitness apps attracting tens of millions of users and online groups proliferating to replace gym closures.

Analysis by anti-fascist organisation Hope Not Hate says the British far right has positioned physical fitness as part of a “wider political struggle” and helped explain how online groups like WSAC could grow even after Covid restrictions have been lifted.

“The danger of these groups lies, firstly, in their emphasis on transforming activists into soldiers that might be motivated to commit acts of violence. And, secondly, in the community they create, where members start to associate sometimes real, positive change in their lives with fascism,” said the organisation’s annual assessment of the extreme right.

Senior researcher Patrik Hermansson said: “These fitness groups frame individual self-improvement as a part of a wider political struggle, creating fresh motivation and a sense of purpose for people who believe that physical confrontation and violence are legitimate and necessary. They have become a space for far-right activists to mobilise.”

Formed during the pandemic, WSAC is run by a Yorkshire-based security guard who uses the pseudonym ‘Sarge’. He has been linked to Patriotic Alternative (PA), which previously helped launch a fascist podcast whose Telegram channel recently featured PA’s leader Mark Collett and far-right YouTuber Laura Towler. Recently, WSAC widened its recruitment efforts on Telegram with members “eventually expected to take part in fights with one another”, suggesting the group’s intention to increase its capacity for violence.

Observing fitness groups over several months, Hermansson monitored how members were initially lured in with health tips and later encouraged into the closed chat groups where the far right shared content. For instance users such as “Dan” who joined one of the larger “fitness fascist” Telegram groups in July 2021 lost 45lb in weight and graduated from member to administrator, posting almost daily. “Associating positive change in one’s life with a violent and hateful ideology is obviously dangerous,” said Hermansson.

Among images posted on the groups are photos of torsos with stickers of Hitler’s face. One admin of a group posted a picture of himself in a gym mirror with the message “training to stop a bus loaded with [philanthropist George] Soros paid protesters”. Another member said: “Defend your race, defend your land, achieve immortality.”

“Ready to join the SS,” added one anonymous user after posting a shirtless picture of himself in the gym mirror. A number accused other men of being “low T” meaning having low levels of testosterone and therefore linked to what they view as a “weak” and “effeminate” political establishment.

Ben Elley, a researcher, said that members of far-right self-improvement groups believed that by becoming physically stronger they could help prevent the white race from destruction. He added that self-improvement “become part of a righteous Manichean battle, greatly distorting the balance of input and reward that might normally be expected”.

Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists also emphasised the importance of physical fitness to his supporters, with the party organising sports clubs and its magazine featuring a weekly keep fit column.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The answer is yes. The proof is not to be found in the documentary broadcast on Italian TV last week, which has generated gigabytes of hype on the internet. It's a turkey, whose evidence that white phosphorus was fired at Iraqi troops is flimsy and circumstantial. But the bloggers debating it found the smoking gun.

The first account they unearthed in a magazine published by the US army. In the March 2005 edition of Field Artillery, officers from the 2nd Infantry's fire support element boast about their role in the attack on Falluja in November last year: ""White Phosphorous. WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE [high explosive]. We fired 'shake and bake' missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out.""

The second, in California's North County Times, was by a reporter embedded with the marines in the April 2004 siege of Falluja. ""'Gun up!' Millikin yelled ... grabbing a white phosphorus round from a nearby ammo can and holding it over the tube. 'Fire!' Bogert yelled, as Millikin dropped it. The boom kicked dust around the pit as they ran through the drill again and again, sending a mixture of burning white phosphorus and high explosives they call 'shake'n'bake' into... buildings where insurgents have been spotted all week.""

White phosphorus is not listed in the schedules of the Chemical Weapons Convention. It can be legally used as a flare to illuminate the battlefield, or to produce smoke to hide troop movements from the enemy. Like other unlisted substances, it may be deployed for ""Military purposes... not dependent on the use of the toxic properties of chemicals as a method of warfare"". But it becomes a chemical weapon as soon as it is used directly against people. A chemical weapon can be ""any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm"".

White phosphorus is fat-soluble and burns spontaneously on contact with the air. According to globalsecurity.org: ""The burns usually are multiple, deep, and variable in size. The solid in the eye produces severe injury. The particles continue to burn unless deprived of atmospheric oxygen... If service members are hit by pieces of white phosphorus, it could burn right down to the bone."" As it oxidises, it produces smoke composed of phosphorus pentoxide. According to the standard US industrial safety sheet, the smoke ""releases heat on contact with moisture and will burn mucous surfaces... Contact... can cause severe eye burns and permanent damage.""

Until last week, the US state department maintained that US forces used white phosphorus shells ""very sparingly in Fallujah, for illumination purposes"". They were fired ""to illuminate enemy positions at night, not at enemy fighters"". Confronted with the new evidence, on Thursday it changed its position. ""We have learned that some of the information we were provided ... is incorrect. White phosphorous shells, which produce smoke, were used in Fallujah not for illumination but for screening purposes, ie obscuring troop movements and, according to... Field Artillery magazine, 'as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes...' The article states that US forces used white phosphorus rounds to flush out enemy fighters so that they could then be killed with high explosive rounds."" The US government, in other words, appears to admit that white phosphorus was used in Falluja as a chemical weapon.

The invaders have been forced into a similar climbdown over the use of napalm in Iraq. In December 2004, the Labour MP Alice Mahon asked the British armed forces minister Adam Ingram ""whether napalm or a similar substance has been used by the coalition in Iraq (a) during and (b) since the war"". ""No napalm,"" the minister replied, ""has been used by coalition forces in Iraq either during the war-fighting phase or since.""

This seemed odd to those who had been paying attention. There were widespread reports that in March 2003 US marines had dropped incendiary bombs around the bridges over the Tigris and the Saddam Canal on the way to Baghdad. The commander of Marine Air Group 11 admitted that ""We napalmed both those approaches"". Embedded journalists reported that napalm was dropped at Safwan Hill on the border with Kuwait. In August 2003 the Pentagon confirmed that the marines had dropped ""mark 77 firebombs"". Though the substance these contained was not napalm, its function, the Pentagon's information sheet said, was ""remarkably similar"". While napalm is made from petrol and polystyrene, the gel in the mark 77 is made from kerosene and polystyrene. I doubt it makes much difference to the people it lands on.

So in January this year, the MP Harry Cohen refined Mahon's question. He asked ""whether mark 77 firebombs have been used by coalition forces"". The US, the minister replied, has ""confirmed to us that they have not used mark 77 firebombs, which are essentially napalm canisters, in Iraq at any time"". The US government had lied to him. Mr Ingram had to retract his statements in a private letter to the MPs in June.

We were told that the war with Iraq was necessary for two reasons. Saddam Hussein possessed biological and chemical weapons and might one day use them against another nation. And the Iraqi people needed to be liberated from his oppressive regime, which had, among its other crimes, used chemical weapons to kill them. Tony Blair, Colin Powell, William Shawcross, David Aaronovitch, Nick Cohen, Ann Clwyd and many others referred, in making their case, to Saddam's gassing of the Kurds in Halabja in 1988. They accused those who opposed the war of caring nothing for the welfare of the Iraqis.

Given that they care so much, why has none of these hawks spoken out against the use of unconventional weapons by coalition forces? Ann Clwyd, the Labour MP who turned from peace campaigner to chief apologist for an illegal war, is, as far as I can discover, the only one of these armchair warriors to engage with the issue. In May this year, she wrote to the Guardian to assure us that reports that a ""modern form of napalm"" has been used by US forces ""are completely without foundation. Coalition forces have not used napalm - either during operations in Falluja, or at any other time"". How did she know? The foreign office minister told her. Before the invasion, Clwyd travelled through Iraq to investigate Saddam's crimes against his people. She told the Commons that what she found moved her to tears. After the invasion, she took the minister's word at face value, when a 30-second search on the internet could have told her it was bunkum. It makes you wonder whether she really gave a damn about the people for whom she claimed to be campaigning.

Saddam, facing a possible death sentence, is accused of mass murder, torture, false imprisonment and the use of chemical weapons. He is certainly guilty on all counts. So, it now seems, are those who overthrew him.

Men more likely to work if they have children, opposite true for women""

But other analysts have taken a different view on the numbers. John Bingham at the Telegraph went with

""Surge in stay-at-home mothers forced into workplace""

While Becky Barrow at the Daily Mail chose:

""Half of women are still working at the age of 60... and men are squeezed out by rise of the working mum""

How can one set of numbers lead to such very different conclusions?

It's true that female employment is rising while male employment is falling - we just didn't think that one was causing the other. So when we produced this graph below - (a graph that covered 40 years of data including economic downturns) we thought it showed broader changes in gender roles. And not necessarily the breakdown of ""what family friendly means"" as other analysts have noted.

We didn't think women were squeezing men out of jobs at all - or that ""stay-at-home mothers"" were being forced to go to work. Why? Because when we looked at statistics on women in work, we didn't see numbers on mothers and men. We saw employment numbers about mothers and fathers and compared them to those for women and men without children. This is what we found...

Men with children 1.4x more likely to work than those without

The Labour Force Survey looked at the percentage of men and women in employment and saw how those rates changed if those individuals were parents. The gaps are striking.

Whether men are 22 or 42, having children means that they are more likely to be in employment - whereas the exact reverse is true for women. That doesn't mean that the gaps are consistent across age groups though. The difference is most visible for men aged 16-24 where not having a child makes it more likely they'll be in education. For women, the differences in employment are clearest between mothers and non-mothers aged 25-34.

Lone mothers are less likely to work than those in couples

Those averages also conceal another important trend - the difference between lone parents and those in couples. There aren't any statistics on lone fathers but for lone mothers, it's clear that the chances of being in employment are lowest when children are younger. The gap closes as children get older, but even when they're at a secondary school age, there's still 5.5 percentage points between women in couples who are working and those who are lone parents.

1 in 2 women in Birmingham are in work

Another caveat here: it's not the same picture across the country. In Northern Ireland, 62% of women are in employment but that figure climbs to 70% in the East of England.

When you drill down to even smaller areas than those regions, the gaps get bigger. The Orkney Islands have the highest proportion of women in work - 79% compared to just 50% of women in Birmingham. With a female employment rate of 61%, inner London is behind the UK average of 66%.

How do we compare to other EU countries?

On average, 1 in 3 senior management roles in the EU is held by a woman. Latvia tops the women power list though, with 45% of employees in the highest jobs being female. Just ahead of the EU average, 34.8% of senior managers in the UK are women - while at the bottom of the list, it's just 18% in Luxembourg and 16% in Cyprus.

Picture so far

It's worth taking a look at the full data release to see just how the employment gap is changing. Here are some other numbers:

SKILLS GAP?

• In 2013, 37% of men were employed in 'upper middle skilled' roles compared with 18% of women. 46% of women were employed in lower middle skilled roles compared with 24% of men.

NO.

• Those gaps persisted, even when the ONS compared male and female graduates with similar qualifications.

TOP EARNERS

• When the ONS looked at the people receiving the highest 10% of salaries, it found that 69% of them were men. But the gap is highest for the older generation - 73% of those getting the best pay who are aged over 40 are men but that figure falls to 55% for those aged 16-24.

A SHRINKING GAP

• In 1971, 92% of men were in work compared to just 53% of women. Over the past 42 years, men's employment has fallen while women's has risen - so today, 76% of men and 67% of women are in work.

In a Facebook post in 2012, Corbyn offered his backing to Los Angeles-based street artist Mear One, whose mural, featuring several known antisemitic tropes, was due to be removed after complaints.

Mear One said on his Facebook page: “Tomorrow they want to buff my mural Freedom of Expression. London Calling, Public art.”

Corbyn replied: “Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera’s [sic] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.”“In 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on the grounds of freedom of speech,” said a statement released by the Labour party on Friday. “However, the mural was offensive, used antisemitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed.”

The mural, which was subsequently scrubbed off, pictured several apparently Jewish bankers playing a game of Monopoly, with their tabletop resting on the bowed naked backs of several workers.

Labour MP Luciana Berger raised the issue with Corbyn’s office after screenshots of the Facebook post emerged. She said on Friday afternoon that she was not satisfied with the statement issued by the Labour press office.

The response from the Spokesperson is wholly inadequate. It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about Antisemitism. I will be raising this further. — Luciana Berger (@lucianaberger) March 23, 2018

Corbyn’s office then released a second statement – shortly after announcing the sacking of the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith. In it, Corbyn said he had made, “a general comment about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech”.

He said the case he cited, in which a mural by Mexican artist Diego Rivera in New York’s Rockefeller centre was plastered over, was “in no way comparable” with the mural in the Facebook post.

“I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and antisemitic,” he said. “The defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of antisemitism in any form. That is a view I’ve always held.”

Corbyn has been accused of failing to crack down on a series of cases of antisemitism.

He recently admitted being a member of a closed Facebook group called Palestine Live, in which a number of antisemitic posts appeared – though he did not join in the conversations and left the group in 2015.

When the existence of the group was revealed earlier this month, Corbyn told reporters: “Had I seen it, of course, I would have challenged it straight away, but I actually don’t spend all my time reading social media.

After Friday’s incident, Labour peer and former Ed Miliband adviser Stewart Wood said: “The German Social Democrats had an expression in the 1890s: ‘antisemitism is the socialism of fools’. Sadly, Labour’s leadership now faces the challenge of having to convince our party and country that they will not tolerate those who confuse the two.”

Dudley MP Ian Austin said the mural was one of the worst antisemitic images he had seen. “Jeremy would never have defended racist imagery aimed at any other group,” he said.

Some Labour MPs have also expressed concerns about the longrunning case of Ken Livingstone, who remains suspended over a series of controversial remarks.

At prime minister’s questions, on Wednesday, Theresa May sought to capitalise on the issue in the run-up to May’s local elections.

“The message is clear: if you believe in good local services, want to see more homes built and want to tackle antisemitism, there is no place for you in the Labour party,” May said.

But some of Corbyn’s allies, including Derby North MP Chris Williamson, have suggested that the issue of antisemitism is being “weaponised” by those critical of Corbyn’s leadership.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

“I am extremely worried about the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, about the processes by which public money has been distributed to private sector companies without due process,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “It really smells of corruption.”

King contrasted the success of the vaccination programme, carried out by the NHS, with the failure of the government’s test-and-trace operation, which has been contracted out to private companies.

“The operation to roll out vaccination has been extremely successful. It was driven through entirely by our truly national health service and GP service – just amazing,” he said. “Yet we have persisted with this money for test and trace, given without competition, without due process … I am really worried about democratic processes being ignored.”

He said: “This is a so-called chumocracy, that has been a phrase used, and that is what it looks like I’m afraid: it is a chumocracy.”

Last May, King set up an independent alternative to the government’s Sage committee, which advises on the pandemic. The intention was for the unpaid members of Independent Sage to offer public advice without political influence, after it was revealed that Johnson’s then adviser Dominic Cummings had sat in on some Sage meetings.

King, a former professor of chemistry at Cambridge University, has a long history of working with governments of all stripes. He was appointed chief scientific adviser under Tony Blair in 2000, serving until 2008, and under the Tory-Lib Dem coalition was appointed chair of the Future Cities Catapult, launched in 2013. He also worked under Johnson as foreign secretary during Theresa May’s premiership.

King said: “He was my boss – he wrote me a handwritten letter to congratulate me on my climate success.”

King rejected the argument that the government had to act quickly to counter the pandemic and had been forced to ignore normal processes in doing so. “People say it’s a crisis – I say the government is using a crisis to privatise sections of the healthcare system in a way that is completely wrong,” he said. “A fraction of this money going to public services would have been far better results.”

He accused the government of acting deliberately to carry out ideological aims of privatising the NHS. “It is slipping this through in the name of a pandemic – effectively, to privatise the NHS by stealth,” he said. “I’m quite sure this has not been an accident, I’m quite sure this has been the plan, there has been clarity in this process. The audacity has been amazing.”

King, who has made the climate crisis one of his key areas of focus, is also concerned about the police and crime bill, which would give police the powers to shut down protests regarded as a nuisance.

He said: “It’s extremely worrying, as we pride ourselves in Britain on having developed a true democracy. Any democracy needs to give voice to dissent. There’s a real danger that we’re going down a pathway that leads away from democracy.”

King recently signed a letter calling on the supreme court to reconsider its pursuit of Tim Crosland, a campaigner against the third runway at Heathrow, for contempt of court. “I think he is being set up as an example to others,” said King. “It shows [the government’s] churlish attitude towards people campaigning.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, said a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled.

The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election.

Boyd said the government was aware of many risks with low likelihoods but potentially very high impacts on the nation, such as pandemics, severe storms and power blackouts. But he said these were assessed independently from one another, underplaying the total risk, which itself was rising due to climate change, population growth and the globalisation of travel.

Looked at alone, a pandemic had appeared unlikely, he said. “As a result, getting sufficient resource just to write a decent biosecurity strategy was tough. Getting resource to properly underpin implementation of what it said was impossible.”

Boyd added: “The middle of a crisis may not be the best time to suggest why we should learn lessons … But many people are more likely to listen now. Certainly, nothing should distract us from getting ahead of Covid-19. My concern is that we should come out of this much wiser.”

The NHS is reported to have failed a government test of its ability to handle a pandemic, though the finding were not made public. Exercise Cygnus, a three-day dry run for a pandemic carried out in October 2016, examined how hospitals and other services would cope in a flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to coronavirus.

According to the Sunday Telegraph, ministers were told three years ago that Britain would be overwhelmed, suffering a lack of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment.

Boyd said politicians found it tough to deliver large-scale preventive policies to a public unconcerned about major risks. “[They] often talk the talk but find it hard to walk the walk of the changes needed. As they are currently structured, governments are hopelessly underpowered to implement the about-turn needed on policy.”

The 2018 biological security strategy, the UK’s first, stated: “The UK is globally renowned for the quality of our preparedness planning [for] significant biological risks.” It noted that the UK spends hundreds of millions of pounds a year on the issue.

“However, these efforts have not always been as well coordinated as they could have been and we have sometimes failed to approach these issues with an international as well as a domestic perspective,” it said. As a result, “we may also fail to maximise the impact of our activities or to tackle issues as quickly as we need to”.

The strategy said the UK maintained “appropriate stockpiles of clinical countermeasures for diseases of concern”, made it a priority “to protect first responders through ensuring that they are equipped and trained properly” and had “a strong public communications capability to ensure we are able to engage swiftly and clearly with the public about any action they might need to take”.

As well as committing to improving government coordination and data sharing, and the communication of risk to the public, the strategy said: “We will develop a UK government response plan for major international diseases to ensure that the government is fully prepared to respond as quickly.”

The UK was ranked second in the world in 2019 by the Global Health Security (GHS) Index, with the US first. The independent GHS Index assessed the capability to prevent and mitigate pandemics in 195 countries.

In July 2019 the House of Commons joint committee on the national security strategy launched an inquiry into preparing for emerging infectious diseases. However, its first evidence session in October was postponed due to debates on Brexit and the calling of a general election. The December election meant the inquiry was cancelled.

Catherine Rhodes, the head of the centre for the study of existential risk at Cambridge University, had been scheduled to give evidence to the MPs’ inquiry. She said the UK had had fairly good pandemic planning in place.

“There does, however, seem to have been a significant gap between recognition of the risk and planning, and action on preparedness,” she said. “In particular, there could have been much better public communication in advance of the outbreak about the sort of measures that might be necessary in such a situation, and surge capacity in the NHS could have been substantially improved.”

Opi Outhwaite, at St Mary’s law school in London, who was also scheduled to give evidence to the inquiry, said: ‘I think broadly that any government would likely have been overwhelmed by this outbreak.”

But she said: “The risk of an outbreak of this type has been known for some time, while the biological security strategy seemed to have stalled. The response aspect of the strategy focuses a lot on deployment of expertise to other parts of the world. To me this emphasises the idea that we needed to be preparing to respond to outbreaks overseas, with less emphasis on what we would do once an outbreak crossed into the UK.

“I suspect that we had to experience a pandemic here first-hand to shift the thinking. It’s very noticeable now hypothetical everything [in the strategy] appears.”

A government spokesman said: “The UK has well-established and world-leading capabilities for dealing with disease outbreaks and pandemics. The UK influenza pandemic preparedness strategy reflects experience and lessons learned from previous pandemics and was used in developing the coronavirus action plan, guided by clinical and scientific advice.”

Boyd said: “If there is a legacy of Covid-19, it might be that it is enough of a warning shot to enough people that it creates the political headroom for serious action.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour government imposed several surcharges on companies and estates, including a 100% excess profits tax (EPT), which lasted a year.

Yet windfall taxes have been introduced by Tory governments on at least three occasions over the last 40 years. If anything, Rishi Sunak’s surcharge on the profits of energy companies has a strong pedigree among leaders who defer to the free market, including Margaret Thatcher and the former chancellor George Osborne. Here is a brief history of Britain’s windfall taxes:

The 1980s

In 1981 Thatcher’s then chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, accused high street banks of escaping the recession. He introduced a special budget levy that creamed off 2.5% of the banks’ non-interest-bearing current account deposits to generate about £400m in extra revenue – equivalent to around a fifth of their profits in those 12 months.

The following year, Treasury officials came to the same conclusion when oil prices soared, and imposed a special tax, raising £2.4bn. North Sea oil firms argued at the time that extra taxes would limit investment, but the industry flourished.

The 1990s

Gordon Brown as chancellor vowed to stick by Tory tax commitments, forcing him to adopt a windfall tax to generate extra revenue. He took aim at utilities that were privatised under the Tories at giveaway prices. They were widely considered to be making excessive profits from their monopolies of sectors previously under state control.

Around £5bn was paid by firms including BAA, British Gas, British Telecom and Powergen.

As the Institute for Government explained: “The tax owed was calculated as 23% of the difference between ‘company value’, calculated by reference to profits over a period of up to four years after privatisation, and the value placed on the company at the time of flotation.” The thinktank said the tax raised £5.2bn, equivalent to around £13bn in today’s terms.

The windfall tax that never happened

In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crash, oil prices soared. A YouGov poll commissioned by the centre-left pressure group Compass and the Observer showed that 67% of Britons “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that a one-off tax should be levied on oil and gas companies. Gas prices had doubled since 2000, and electricity prices were up by nearly two-thirds. Energy companies’ profits had climbed nearly sixfold in three years.

A large group of Labour MPs backed the poll, but Brown, now prime minister, rejected the idea, arguing that a tax on profits could damage economic competitiveness at a fragile time with a recession looming, while costs might be passed on to consumers.

Osborne’s oil tax

In 2011 Osborne increased the surcharge on North Sea oil and gas producers from 20% to 32% above the normal rate of corporation tax, arguing that “when oil prices are high … UK oil and gas production is more profitable … so it is fair that companies should contribute more”.

It’s a bit of a cheat to include Osborne in the list because his botched scheme wasn’t designed as a one-off windfall tax, but a multi-year increase that would last as long as prices remained high. Instead the 12 percentage points increase, which raised £2bn in its first year, was supposed to underwrite a 1p reduction in the duty on petrol and diesel and scrap a further 5p increase due under plans agreed by the previous Labour government.

It became a windfall tax after the oil and gas industry responded by cutting investment, spooking the Treasury and forcing a U-turn. A year later Osborne, who had promised the industry a stable tax regime and failed to give any advanced warning, offered to shield £500m of investment from tax. Later, and as the oil price plummeted, he cut the headline rate of tax back to previous levels.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

We know instinctively what it means. Respect for others - their opinions, values and way of life. Respect for neighbours; respect for the community that means caring about others. Respect for property which means not tolerating mindless vandalism, theft, and graffiti. And self-respect, which means giving as well as taking.

Respect is at the heart of a belief in society. It is what makes us a community, not merely a group of isolated individuals. It makes real a new contract between citizen and state, a contract that says that with rights and opportunities come responsibilities and obligations. The theme of rights and responsibilities will be central to the Queen's Speech.

We are putting behind us the narrow, selfish individualism of the 1980s, but also the 1945 'big state' that wrongly believed it could solve every social problem. We are building an enabling state founded on the liberation of individual potential.

From the 1940s to the 1970s government sought to address social and economic problems through intervention and state planning. Social democrats in Britain and the US who held a liberal view of the 'permissive society' divorced fairness from personal responsibility. They believed that the state had an unconditional obligation to provide welfare and security. The logic was that the individual owed nothing in return.

By the early 1970s this language of rights was corroding civic duty and undermining the fight-back against crime and social decay. It led Robert Kennedy to lament of America, 'the destruction of the sense, and often the fact, of community, of human dialogue, the thousand invisible strands of common experience and purpose, affection and respect, which tie men to their fellows'.

From the 1970s to the 1990s governments tried to prevent the decline of civic society by strengthening individualism. But while the individualism of the New Right in the 1980s and 1990s in part restored personal responsibility, it too often simply abandoned individuals and communities to help themselves. The obligation of society to advance the individual was denied.

This had devastating consequences still with us today. By the mid-1990s crime was rising, there was escalating family breakdown and drug abuse, and social inequalities had widened. Many neighbourhoods became marked by vandalism, violent crime, and the loss of civility. The basic recognition of the mutuality of duty and reciprocity of respect on which civil society depends appeared lost. It evoked the sense that the moral fabric of community was unravelling.

The separation of fairness from responsibility was a failure both of policy and of philosophy. Crime and social breakdown affect everyone, but it is the poorest and most disadvantaged whose quality of life suffers most. Residents on our poorest estates still face a risk of burglary that is three times higher than the national average, an unbearable burden, while everyone in our society suffers as a consequence of the social disintegration around them.

There is a dreadful irony that at the height of Thatcherism, when the central idea of the neo-liberal Right was to place individual choice above all other values, the old Left became a mirror image of the Right. It stressed social rights to the exclusion of individual responsibilities, just as Thatcherism stressed individual economic rights to the exclusion of social responsibility.

Rights and responsibilities have always been at the heart of my politics. It was the inability of either mainstream party to offer a coherent response to crime and anti-social behaviour that made me so determined to transform radically Labour's position when I became Shadow Home Secretary in 1992. I had seen from my own Sedgefield constituency the destructive impact of lawlessness on local communities. As the 1980s had progressed I sensed increasingly that the task for the centre-Left was not to replace crude individualism with an overbearing paternalistic state. It was to rebuild a strong civic society where rights and duties go hand in hand.

Crime and anti-social behaviour is a Labour issue. In many of the poorest parts of Britain, in many traditional Labour areas, it is the issue. For, however much schools and hospitals improve, if people walk out of their doors and are confronted by abuse, vandalism, anti-social behaviour, they will never feel secure or able to take advantage of new opportunities.

In today's world people want a society that is free from prejudice - racism and intolerance - but not free from rules. Stability and order in our communities is as fundamental to our progressive project for change as the extension of opportunity.

Our new approach starts with opportunity.

We are investing heavily in the biggest anti-poverty programme for half a century. Record investment in education, the New Deal, the Working Families Tax Credit, record increases in child benefit and income support, and Sure Start. Excellence in Cities has seen deprived boroughs such as Tower Hamlets sustain a 7 per cent improvement in GCSE results this year.

The New Deal is a symbol of this mission. It explicitly seeks to provide new opportunities in return for new responsibilities. It reaches not only the unemployed but single parents and sick and disabled people.

Our commitment to equalising opportunity has also meant a concerted effort to support and sustain poorer families under pressure. The life-chances of children are hugely influenced by their earliest experiences, which is why access to post-natal support, parenting classes and early years provision are so important for a fair society.

With these new opportunities come responsibility. The street crime initiative, for example, has been one of the most successful partnerships between government and the police in living memory. But the truth is people don't feel more secure and they know the system is not yet working as it should. It has become inceasingly clear what the problem with the system is:

· A nineteenth-century criminal justice system trying to solve twenty-first-century crimes;

· Too little joined-up working between police, CPS and other agencies;

· Too little focus on the hard core of persistent offenders who commit more than half the crime;

· Court procedures that are cumbersome;

· Justice weighted towards the criminal and in need of rebalancing towards the victim;

· Police not freed up and given the flexibility to focus on the crime and antisocial behaviour;

· Punishment that often does not fit the severity of the crime.

So this autumn we will focus on tackling these problems. We are pursuing radical reform of the Criminal Justice System, tackling anti-social behaviour and restoring social cohesion to fragmented communities.

Over the coming year we will turn up the pace of reform in seven key areas, confronting the vested interests that hold back change, and implement tough new measures against those who persistently flout the law. We need to drag the English legal system away from what Lord Justice Auld describes as 'centuries of haphazard statutory and common law accretion'.

First, in a major reform of criminal justice, we will re-balance the system emphatically in favour of the victims of crime. Offenders get away too easily. Old rules must be swept away; court procedures simplified; sentences built around the offender as well as the offence, with those on drugs getting treatment or custody. Previous convictions should be properly taken into account, so should hearsay evidence; there should be a change to the double jeopardy law. If there is overwhelming new evidence that implicates the accused again, they should go back to court. That has long been the case in Germany, Finland and Denmark. Magistrates should be able to give tougher sentences and we will bring together the magistrates and crown courts to speed up prosecutions.

Second, we must introduce tougher sentences for violent and sex offenders with release from custody only when they no longer present a risk to the public. We must ensure that sentencing fits the crime and deals with the offender to prevent reoffending. The 'Custody Plus' programme will ensure that all short-sentence prisoners are supervised after release. Our aim is a Criminal Justice System that identifies every drug-addicted offender and aims to get each one of them off drugs and away from crime.

Third, we will ensure that people pay for their crimes. From early next year, suspected drug dealers or organised criminals with money in their bank account or a home or an asset but no visible means of support will have it taken away from them unless it can be shown that it was come by lawfully and not by crime.

Fourth, we are reforming what the police do. Too often red-tape distracts the police from catching criminals. We are doing a wide-ranging review of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. We want to introduce street bail so the police can stay on the street and not always return with the suspect to the police station, and enable the police to impose bail conditions before a suspect has been charged to prevent them from committing further offences or intimidating witnesses.

Fifth, we will extend both the principle and the practice of instant 'on-the-spot' fines to tackle anti-social behaviour. We will also bring forward measures to deal with parents of tru ants who refuse to co-operate with the school. They will face a penalty. Far too many parents still condone truancy by their children so we will make it far easier to impose these penalties.

We need a new, simpler and tougher approach to anti-social behaviour. It is petty crime and public nuisance that causes so much distress to people; vandalism, graffiti, low-level aggression and violence. Anti-social tenants and their anti-social landlords can make life hell for their community. Families have a right to be housed. But they have no right to terrorise those around them. We will give local authorities new powers to license private-sector landlords, ensuring that landlords and their tenants behave responsibly.

But a modern civic society, underpinned by reformed public services and an active welfare state, won't emerge simply through better laws, tougher enforcement of obligations, sanctions and more police. As well as modernising the Criminal Justice System and tackling anti-social behaviour we also need to revive the spirit of community and social cohesion. As Martin Luther King argued in the 1960s' struggle for civil rights, laws 'restrain the heartless; they cannot change the heart'.

A bigger role for the voluntary sector, in framing and delivering local services, is central to our vision. Urban regeneration programmes backed by large extra resources have made a real impact particularly where decisions have been made by local people, as I saw for myself in Teesside and east Manchester.

The informal networks between people and families are what best protect communities and build a strong society. William Morris put it well: 'Fellowship is life, and lack of fellowship is death.'

We are encouraging volunteering through TimeBank, the Experience Corps and the volunteering option in the New Deal. Many different initiatives are taking hold. Teach First for example is a pioneering programme to get some of Britain's brightest graduates into London's toughest schools. Citizenship is now part of the national curriculum. The national lottery will put an extra £750 million into new sports and communities facilities.

Only by rebuilding cohesive communities and reforming our criminal justice system can we achieve our vision of a strong and fair society. It means abandoning the rhetoric and false choices of the past. Since 1945 our politics has too often failed to articulate a coherent response to crime and anti-social behaviour. Restoring civic responsibility is not a betrayal of social justice, but essential for its realisation. We are determined to succeed in the task of reform.

In a speech to small firms, the prime minister will claim that he is leading the first government in decades to have slashed more needless regulation than it introduced.

Among the regulations to be watered down will be protections for hedgerows and rules about how businesses dispose of waste, despite Cameron's claims to lead the greenest government ever.

Addressing the Federation of Small Businesses conference, Cameron will argue that the new rules will make it ""vastly cheaper"" for businesses to comply with their environmental obligations.

The government also plans to scrap many building standards relating to things such as the size of windows and demands for renewable energy sources, saving builders about £500 for each new home.

""We have trawled through thousands of pieces of regulation, from the serious to the ridiculous, and we will be scrapping or amending over 3,000 regulations – saving business well over £850m every single year. That's half a million pounds which will be saved for businesses every single day of the year,"" Cameron will claim. [see footnote]

No 10 sources insisted that the new rules would not necessarily mean the environment suffers, as they claim many of the regulations are obsolete.

However, the move comes after the coalition was criticised for overhauling planning guidance to make way for new homes, relaxing restrictions on how developers can build on green spaces.

Amid a severe housing shortage, particularly in the south-east, the coalition is desperate for builders to start work on new homes.

Cameron's pitch to small businesses appears to be the first stage of a fightback against Labour's attempts to depict itself as the champion of small businesses.

Last month, Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, pledged to give small firms more help with escalating business rates and soaring energy costs. Speaking at the same conference as Cameron, Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, will promise to create a new small business agency – modelled on the small business administration under US president Barack Obama – if Labour wins the next election.

This body would ""remove blockages to business growth, ensuring the voices of small businesses and entrepreneurs are better heard in policymaking"".

Umunna will say: ""So Britain can grow its way out of the cost of living crisis and build a balanced recovery built to last, we need to do all we can to help our small businesses grow, create new jobs and meet their aspirations.

""We need government to be a better servant – and customer – of our small businesses and to make sure that entrepreneurs' voices are heard at the top table. A UK Small Business Administration is necessary to realising this ambition.""

Karen Mills, former head of the US small business administration and a former member of Obama's cabinet, will also address the conference and urge politicians to give small businesses ""a seat at the table"".","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The first is to protect our security.

The rise of international terrorism, mass movements of people, the transformation in communications technology which makes it easier for terrorists to plan and co-ordinate their campaign.

All of these things make it harder for governments to protect their citizens.

And the security challenge is amplified by the willingness of today's terrorists to murder innocent civilians on a vast scale, using whatever weapons they can get their hands on - and being prepared to kill themselves at the same time.

Thwarting the plans of these terrorists is an awesome responsibility, which must be the first priority for any government.

But there is a second great challenge too: protecting our liberty.

Again, technology plays a part in making the challenge tougher.

Advances in computer science, information storage and satellite monitoring systems make it easier and easier for the powerful - whether it's government departments, agencies of the state or private businesses - to keep tabs on people.

Citizens have to deal with an expanding array of ever-more complex bureaucracies that are intruding into their lives in a way that previous generations would have considered unacceptable.

And the fight against terrorism itself necessarily involves the state taking on new powers of surveillance and enforcement.

But while the relationship between individual citizens and powerful institutions may change in response to changing circumstances, it is vital that free societies do all they can to maintain people's human rights and civil liberties, not least because a free society is, in the long term, one of the best protections against terrorism and crime.

Getting the balance right

The fundamental challenge, then, is to strike the right balance between security and liberty.

But it's hard - extremely hard - to make that crucial judgement: how much freedom should we forego in order to be safe?

At what point does the pursuit of security start to undermine the open society that we are seeking to protect, and which is also a key to our security in the long term?

On previous occasions, I have started to set out my thinking on the security challenge.

In August last year I looked at the three key areas where we need action to fight terrorism: international relations; domestic security, and community cohesion.

And in a number of speeches and articles over the past twelve months I have looked at how we should fight crime from empowering communities and social enterprises so we can truly get to grips with the causes of crime to reforming the police so they are properly enabled to carry out their principal duty: preventing crime.

In the months ahead, I will also be examining in detail the other key aspects of the fight against crime: improving the effectiveness of the courts and the CPS, and making sure that our prisons really work.

David Davis and I are fiercely determined to protect Britain's security with tough and intelligent action to fight crime and to fight terrorism.

But in doing so, we will never be casual about our freedoms.

We understand that freedom is central to the British way of life.

It is a vital part of our history and our heritage.

We feel it in our bones.

So our approach to the twin challenges of security and freedom, and to the challenge of balancing the two, is clear.

We will be the hard-nosed defenders of security and freedom.

Both are vital to our nation's well-being.

So we should be permanently vigilant.

We should never stop thinking hard about how to protect our security and freedom as our society and our circumstances change.

I want to make a constructive contribution to that debate today.

But first I'd like to assess the current Government's approach since 1997.

Hyperactive on security

Labour's approach to security is characterised by hyperactivity.

Since 1997 there have been 54 criminal justice bills.

Some changes that the Government has introduced are necessary.

We support tougher sentences, for example.

But we have seen much legislation that is at the same time authoritarian and ineffective - legislation that fails to protect our security but which in the process undermines our civil liberties.

So we objected to the ill-judged attempt to criminalise religious hatred, which would have unacceptably restrained free speech.

We were sceptical about some of the new powers for government in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.

We opposed the Government's undermining of the right to trial by jury and some of the more draconian powers proposed under the Civil Contingencies Bill.

And we strongly oppose Labour's plans for ID cards.

This is a measure that fails on every count.

It would impose a burden on citizens and intrude upon their privacy.

Yet it would do little to protect them from harm.

And now, after nine years of hyperactive legislating, Tony Blair himself acknowledges that the criminal justice system in our country is not working.

The Government has tried to be tough on crime, but it has failed.

It has tried to be tough on terrorism, but its efforts have been undermined.

Ironically, Labour's attempts to tackle crime and terrorism have been undermined in part by its approach to the second challenge it has tried to address - protecting our rights and freedoms.

Human Rights Act

The centrepiece of this Government's approach to freedom and civil liberty is the Human Rights Act.

The Act was passed in 1998 with clear intentions.

Since 1950, British citizens have enjoyed explicit protection of a number of specific freedoms under the European Convention on Human Rights.

Britainplayed a leading role in drawing up the Convention, which provides for the collective enforcement of the liberties set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The rights set out in the Articles of the ECHR include the right to life; prohibition of torture; the right to a fair trial; the right to respect for private and family life; freedom of thought, conscience and religion; freedom of expression; freedom of assembly and association; the right to marry, and prohibition of discrimination.

It is important today for us to understand not just the fact of Britain's participation in the ECHR, but the nature of that participation.

We signed up to the ECHR in full, with no reservations.

Other countries have signed up with reservations that permit them to override certain Articles of the ECHR.

France, notably, has preserved the right to derogate from the ECHR in times of emergency under the conditions laid down by the French Constitution.

Until the Human Rights Act was implemented in 2000, any British citizen who felt that their rights had been infringed had to take their case to the European court of Human Rights in Strasbourg- a complex and time-consuming process.

So the Human Rights Act incorporated the European Convention, in its entirety - and therefore with no reservations - into UKlaw.

The Act was intended, in effect, to bring the ECHR home to enable our citizens to seek protection in our courts of their civil liberties under the European Convention.

The idea was to give people a clear sense of their rights in an increasingly complicated world.

On the face of it, this seemed a logical step.

Now, six years on from the Human Rights Act, we can assess exactly what the consequences have been - and their impact on the vital challenge of balancing freedom with security.

Impact of the HRA

We should start by acknowledging that some of the direct consequences of the Human Rights Act have been positive ones.

Of the hundreds of cases that have come to court involving the HRA - some 400 in the last year alone - there have been some rulings setting important precedents that we can all welcome.

One example is the right of an elderly married couple not to be separated in different care homes.

Another is the right of the families of the deceased to be represented at coroner's inquests.

But in other respects, the Human Rights Act has made things worse.

When Tony Blair talks about the criminal justice system being tilted in favour of the criminal and away from the victim, I'm afraid he's describing, in part, the consequences of the Human Rights Act.

And when he seeks more and more new powers to tackle terrorism, it's partly because the existing powers of the state are undermined by the Human Rights Act.

The HRA and crime

There are a wide range of areas in which the Human Rights Act has made the fight against crime harder.

Some are direct; some are indirect.

One example is the Assets Recovery Agency, which was set up to seize the assets of major criminals.

The agency has been forced to spend millions of pounds fighting legal challenges brought by criminals under the Human Rights Act.

This has had bogged down cases for years, and the backlog in the courts has grown to 146 uncompleted claims.

The Director of the Agency has directly blamed the human rights ""bandwagon"" for thwarting its efforts.

Another example of the unintended and often perverse consequences of the Human Rights Act was the case of the convicted rapist, Anthony Rice, who was wrongly released on licence and then murdered Naomi Bryant.

The Bridges Report set up to investigate the case makes clear that one of the factors that influenced the thinking of officials in dealing with Rice was a concern that he might sue them under the Human Rights Act.

Of course, there were other elements in the case that had no connection to human rights.

And it is true that any legal challenge by Rice might well have failed.

But it remains the case that officials sought to protect themselves rather than risk defeat in the courts.

The Rice case illustrates a wider trend.

Even without actual litigation, some public bodies are now so frightened of being sued under the Human Rights Act that they try to protect themselves by making decisions that are often absurd and occasionally dangerous.

The Act is also inhibiting the ability of the police to prevent crime.

We saw this recently when the police tried to recapture foreign ex-prisoners who should have been deported and had instead gone on the run.

The obvious thing to do would have been to issue 'Wanted' posters but police forces across the country refused to do so on the grounds that it would breach the HRA.

The Association of Chief Police Officers says in its guidance to forces: ""Article 8 of the Human Rights Act gives everyone the right to respect for their private and family life... and publication of photographs could be a breach of that.""

According to ACPO, photographs should be released only in ""exceptional circumstances"", where public safety needs override the case for privacy.

Remember that these were criminals who had been convicted of very serious offences and who shouldn't even have been in the UK.

Yet the Metropolitan Police said, ""We will use all the tools in our tool box to try and find them without printing their identity - that's the last recourse.""

The HRA and terrorism

The Human Rights Act has a similarly damaging impact on our ability to protect our society against terrorism.

One of the most obvious ways in which our Government can help prevent terrorist outrages in Britainis to deport foreign nationals who threaten our security.

It is clear that we should have the right the right to live here to those who want to do our country harm.

Yet the Government is finding it increasingly difficult to do this.

The difficulty is not caused by the Human Rights Act.

But the Human Rights Act has made the problem worse.

The key factor here is the European Court of Human Rights judgement in the Chahal case in 1996.

The court in Strasbourgruled that the British Home Secretary cannot balance the human rights risk to an individual if they are deported against the security risk to the UKif they stay.

This applies once it is established that the person to be deported is at substantial risk of suffering torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.

It is worth reminding ourselves of the words used in that judgement:

""The activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration.""

This European Court judgement, made in 1996 before the Human Rights Act has been used as case law in British courts since the Human Rights Act.

This has made it harder than it otherwise would have been for the Government to deport dangerous terrorists.

Home Secretary Jack Straw discovered this in the Singh and Singh case in 2000.

His judgement was that these two men, who had committed no crime under British law, were nevertheless a serious threat to our security.

But a British judge, guided by the Human Rights Act and its requirement to use ECHR jurisprudence as a precedent, ruled that the Home Secretary could not make that judgement.

The Special Immigration Appeals Commission was not happy about having to follow the ECHR jurisprudence. Mr Justice Potts, when giving the judgment, said: ""law abiding citizens of the United Kingdommight reasonably feel disquiet about a state of affairs which permits international terrorists proved to be a danger to the national security to remain here"".

He was not permitted to balance the security of our country against the risk to the individuals concerned if they were deported.

More recently, the deportation issue was brought into dramatic focus by the case of the Belmarsh detainees.

There is no admissible evidence that these individuals, all of them foreign nationals, have committed a crime under British law for which they can be prosecuted.

However, there is sufficient intelligence material relating to their danger to our security that a judge was persuaded, under the auspices of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, to detain them.

In that situation, there is clearly a strong case for deportation.

But because of the interaction of the Human Rights Act and the nature of our participation in the ECHR, that is not possible.

In the specific case of the Belmarsh detainees, the Government has sought a solution through its policy of control orders.

But it has been an incredibly costly, time-consuming and complicated process.

And this is where, just as with the criminal justice system, we also need to consider the indirect impact of the Human Rights Act.

Before the Chahal case, and before the Human Rights Act, if a Home Secretary had considered a foreign national to be sufficiently dangerous, that individual could be deported without undue delay.

Today, not only can the individual not be deported.

The lengths to which the authorities have to go even to detain them are so great that many serious suspects are allowed to remain here at liberty.

Think about the message that sends to terrorists and their supporters around the world.

It is practically an invitation for terrorists and would-be terrorists to come to Britain, safe in the knowledge that whatever crime they may have committed in their home country and whatever suspicion there may be that they might be planning a terrorist attack in the UK or elsewhere they won't be sent back to their country of origin and may not even be detained, because the process is so complicated and time-consuming for the Government.

Of course I accept that each individual case needs to be judged on its merits.

And of course Britainmust never endorse or collude in human rights abuse in other countries.

But a British Home Secretary must have more flexibility in making a judgement in the public interest, balancing the rights of terror suspects against the rights of British citizens.

At present the jurisprudence from cases such as Chahal prevents this happening.

And the Human Rights Act compounds the problem.

I believe it is wrong to undermine public safety - and indeed public confidence in the concept of human rights - by allowing highly dangerous criminals and terrorists to trump the rights of the people of Britainto live in security and peace.

Failure of the HRA to protect our rights

But while the Human Rights Act has had a number of unwelcome direct and indirect consequences for our ability to fight crime and terrorism, even in its own terms it has not actually proved to be effective in protecting fundamental rights in Britain.

It has not protected the right to trial by jury.

It did not prevent the right to free speech from being undermined in the Government's legislation on religious hatred.

We need a new approach

So any fair audit of the Human Rights Act would come to the conclusion that change is needed in order to protect both our security and freedom more effectively.

The Human Rights Act has made it harder to protect our security.

And it's done little to protect some of our liberties.

It is hampering the fight against crime and terrorism.

And it has helped to create a culture of rights without responsibilities.

Tony Blair himself recognises this.

It is why he keeps talking about reviewing the Human Rights Act and rebalancing the criminal justice system.

But the truth is, Labour got us into this mess.

So it's hard to see how they can get us out of it.

The Prime Minister seems unwilling or unable to accept the consequences of his own legislation.

We see this all the time.

Only a few weeks ago, under intense pressure following the release of dangerous foreign prisoners, Tony Blair promised Parliament:

'I think that it is now time that anybody who is convicted of an imprisonable offence and who is a foreign national is deported'.

That same day, it was pointed out to him that his pledge was impossible to meet, thanks in part to his own Human Rights Act.

This is a blind spot for Labour.

They will the ends, but they aren't prepared to will the means an entirely new approach that properly protects our security, and strikes a better balance between security and freedom.

The precise problem

In order to establish the correct principles for such an approach, we must be forensically precise in understanding the challenges we face.

In protecting our security, the key challenges are fighting crime and fighting terrorism.

For crime, the problem is quite clear.

The Human Rights Act has introduced a culture that has inhibited law enforcement and the supervision of convicted criminals.

For terrorism, it is more complicated.

The Human Rights Act makes things worse in that it obliges British courts to base their judgements on the ECHR and the case law - including Chahal - that goes with it, giving them no scope to develop their own principles.

But simply removing the Human Rights Act would not solve the problem.

We would still be left with a situation in which terrorist suspects could go to the European Court- for example to avoid deportation.

Other European countries have taken steps to protect their vital interests with reservations.

In Germany, the existence of the Basic Law - a clearly codified constitutional document - provides a different solution.

The European Court, through what is known as the ""margin of appreciation"", tends to defer to any clearly set out domestic constitutional doctrine.

But Britainhas neither a reservation against the ECHR; nor a clearly set out constitutional doctrine, like the Germans.

So the European Court of Human Rights has nothing to go on except its own previous rulings.

Examples from elsewhere in Europetherefore point us in the right direction.

And it is a direction which helps us with the other great challenge we face: protecting our freedom.

Here too, as we have seen, the Human Rights Act is inadequate.

So I firmly believe that we need a clear articulation of citizen's rights that British people can use in British courts.

Options for change

What are the options open to us?

There is a case for simply abolishing the Human Rights Act and doing nothing else.

This has the advantage of simplicity.

And it would at least help us in the fight against crime.

But it would not solve the problem on terrorism.

And it has the strong disadvantage of taking a step backwards on rights and liberties.

Citizens would have to go once again to an international court to enforce their freedoms.

It would lead to a procession of cases going to the Human Rights court in Strasbourgat considerable public cost and Britainbeing governed in part by court judgments made in Strasbourg, with little or no reference to home-grown British law.

Another option is to abolish the Human Rights Act and pull out of the ECHR.

This also has some logical consistency.

It would address the security challenge, both in terms of crime and terrorism.

But it would have three significant disadvantages.

Yes, British citizens could still rely on ancient rights as developed over time in our Common Law and through Parliament but we have to recognise that the Common Law cannot properly protect the citizen from ministers who have the power to override it by statutory instrument.

Likewise, we would be left with little protection against a government that could at will abrogate or repeal habeas corpus or any other protection of freedom.

Thirdly, the act of leaving the ECHR would send a message to all those countries that we encouraged to sign up to it that you cannot have rights and security at the same time.

The right approach

So I believe that the time has now come for a new solution that protects liberties in this country that is home-grown and sensitive to Britain's legal inheritance that enables people to feel they have ownership of their rights and one which at the same time enables a British Home Secretary to strike a common-sense balance between civil liberties and the protection of public security.

The Conservative Party, under my leadership, is determined to provide a hard-nosed defence of security and freedom.

And I believe that the right way to do that is through a modern British Bill of Rights that also balances rights with responsibilities.

This would clearly set out people's rights, would enable those rights to be protected in British courts, and would strengthen our hand in the fight against crime and terrorism.

A modern British bill of rights

Without being too prescriptive at this stage, it is possible to outline the key elements of such a Bill.

A modern British Bill of Rights needs to define the core values which give us our identity as a free nation.

It should spell out the fundamental duties and responsibilities of people living in this country both as citizens and foreign nationals.

And it should guide the judiciary and the Government in applying human rights law when the lack of responsibility of some individuals threatens the rights of others.

It should enshrine and protect fundamental liberties such as jury trial, equality under the law and civil rights.

And it should protect the fundamental rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights in clearer and more precise terms.

Greater clarity and precision would allow those rights to be enforced more easily and effectively in circumstances where they ought to be protected but it would become harder to extend them inappropriately as under the present law.

Greater clarity and precision in the law, as opposed to vague general principles, which can be interpreted in many different ways, is more in accordance with this country's legal tradition.

The start of a procress

So I am today committing my Party to work towards the production of such a Bill of Rights.

There are huge difficulties and subtleties involved in drafting such a text.

It is not a process that can be rushed.

And I believe that a satisfactory outcome depends upon achieving a national consensus.

So I don't for a moment imagine that this is something that can be drafted by a few politicians in Westminster.

I shall in due course be announcing a panel of distinguished jurists and other experts who will help us with the drafting of this Bill.

I shall set out also, at that time, the process through which we hope - over a number of years - to promote public debate as the drafting proceeds, in order to achieve a lasting consensus.

A bill built to last

As well as getting the content of the Bill right, there are two key questions that will need to be addressed.

The first relates to the permanence of the Bill.

It will serve its purposes better if it cannot easily be repealed.

It is often said that the British constitution could be summed up in eight words:

""Whatever the Queen enacts in Parliament is law.""

So we need to examine ways of entrenching the Bill.

One of the options is the removal of powers under the Parliament Act for the House of Commons alone to amend or repeal the Bill of Rights.

By these and other means we can give the Bill of Rights a status similar to that of the German Basic Law and in so doing help restore British parliamentary supremacy as against law made elsewhere.

The second key question will be the relationship between the Bill and the European Court of Human Rights.

The existence of a clear and codified British Bill of Rights will tend to lead the European Court of Human Rights to apply the ""margin of appreciation"".

This means that the court in Strasbourgwill tend to respect and uphold the principles laid down in the Bill of Rights whenever they can.

In other words we will be given the benefit of our own clearly stated statement of values.

So we have the prospect of an enduring British solution that can command the respect of our own people and of the Strasbourgcourt.

But there may still be a need to deal at times with the European Court's interpretation of the Convention - as in the Chahal case.

And so one of the challenges for our panel of jurists and legal experts will be to determine how the nature of our participation in the ECHR can be aligned with the principles and legal effect of our modern British Bill of Rights.

This is vital. As I have said before, it is not enough just to will the end, which in this case is the ability to deport potentially dangerous terrorists, it is necessary to will the means to that end.

Conclusion

None of this will be easy.

The protection of civil liberties is never easy.

The protection of public security is never easy.

Striking the right balance between civil liberties and public security is still more difficult.

But I believe that the time has come for this country to face that challenge.

I believe that by facing the challenge, by establishing a new landmark in our constitution and our legislation, we can make Britaina better place to live.

I also believe that a well-drafted and enduring Bill of Rights can make it easier to achieve the acceptance by every citizen in Britainof the rights of every other inhabitant of these islands.

That, in turn, can help us to promote active citizenship and to forge a renewed sense of national cohesion making a lasting contribution to the general wellbeing of our country.""","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Writing about the rise of the religion in an appendix added to a later edition of The Dream of Rome, his 2006 book about the Roman empire, Johnson said there was something about Islam that hindered development in parts of the globe and, as a result, “Muslim grievance” was a factor in virtually every conflict.

Johnson’s argument was described as disconcerting and problematic by Tell Mama, which monitors anti-Muslim hate and said he had demonstrated a lack of understanding of the religion. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said many people would like to know if the favourite to become the next prime minister still believed “Islam inherently inhibits the path to progress and freedom”.

Last year, Johnson was accused of dog-whistle politics after he used a Telegraph column to liken women wearing the burqa to “letter boxes” and “bank robbers”.

Quick Guide About this series Show The real Boris Johnson Over the course of the week, the Guardian is publishing a series of news reports, features and multimedia components on the man widely expected to be the next Conservative leader – and therefore prime minister. In coverage that ranges from his early days as a journalist to his last senior job as foreign secretary, we will seek to shed light on the exploits, ambitions and values of one of the most consequential – and most divisive – politicians of the age.

Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

In an essay titled And Then Came the Muslims, added to the 2007 edition of his book, Johnson wrote: “There must be something about Islam that indeed helps to explain why there was no rise of the bourgeoisie, no liberal capitalism and therefore no spread of democracy in the Muslim world.

“It is extraordinary to think that under the Roman/Byzantine empire, the city of Constantinople kept the candle of learning alight for a thousand years, and that under Ottoman rule, the first printing press was not seen in Istanbul until the middle of the nineteenth century. Something caused them to be literally centuries behind.”

The Conservative leadership frontrunner wrote that the inhibitor of progress was “a fatal religious conservatism” and the further the Muslim world had “fallen behind, the more bitterness and confusion there has been, to the point where virtually every global flashpoint you can think of – from Bosnia to Palestine to Iraq to Kashmir – involves some sense of Muslim grievance”.

The MCB said: “We of course are of the view that Islam has a role to play in progress and prosperity, be that in the Muslim world or here at our home in the west.”

Mohammed Amin

Mohammed Amin, a former chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, said Johnson’s analysis risked “actively promoting hatred of Muslims”. Amin was expelled by the forum in June after criticising the party leadership’s response to reports of Islamophobia and comparing Johnson’s popularity to that of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s.

In the book, published after the airing of a TV series with the same name, Johnson likened the Roman empire to the EU, marvelling at the former’s ability to create unity across continents.

The essay was written as negotiations for Turkey to join the EU were under way and Johnson argued Ankara should be allowed to become a member, creating “once again a Roman economic community” and “reuniting the two halves of the Roman empire around the shores of the Mediterranean”.

He said the country’s “far from perfect” record on human rights was “one of the most important reasons for keeping the Turks on the tram tracks to EU membership, surely, that we thereby help the progressive forces in Turkey and stop the country drifting backwards”.

The MCB said: “Many of us would be interested to find out whether Mr Johnson still believes that Islam inherently inhibits the path to progress and freedom, and whether he still thinks Turkey should be admitted to the European Union, especially after the extraordinary and false claims made about Turkish and Muslim immigration during the Brexit campaign.”

During the EU referendum campaign, Johnson argued a leave vote would allow the UK to “end uncontrolled immigration”. He was a figurehead for the Vote Leave campaign, which issued a controversial poster claiming Turkey was joining the EU, despite talks to this end having long since stalled.

In the essay, Johnson acknowledged Christianity had a history of “disgusting cruelty”, writing: “It wasn’t so long ago that we were burning books and heretics ourselves.”

He added: “These Muslims are not some alien species.” Johnson criticised newspaper editors who thought an “Islamo-panicky headline [was] good for sales” and “politicians hungry for votes” who made the same calculation.

He said his great-grandfather Ali Kemal, a Turkish politician, had been a Muslim, and so he hoped he would not be accused of Islamophobia for quoting Winston Churchill’s claim that there was “no stronger retrograde force” in the world than Islam.

“It is time to get deep down and dirty and examine the central charge made by everyone from Winston Churchill to the Pope, namely that the real problem with the Islamic world is Islam,” Johnson wrote. “We must be honest and accept that there is more than a grain of truth in Churchill’s analysis of the economic and social consequences of the religion.”

After describing the beauty of the Sistine Chapel, Johnson wrote: “There is nothing like it in Muslim art of that or any age, not just because it is beyond the technical accomplishment of Islamic art, but because it is so theologically offensive to Islam.”

Tell Mama said the essay portrayed Muslims as “a wave or horde … who had little time for the intricacies and legacies of civilisations like that of Rome”.

Johnson’s words gave the impression Muslims were somehow “mentally constrained by Islam”, they said. “That shows a lack of understanding of Islam, and there are many Muslims whom Islam has inspired to produce some of the most beautiful art forms in their love for life and beauty. We hope Johnson works to support all communities in the future, and we are here to assist and support that.”

Johnson’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Carl Benjamin, a social media activist who previously tweeted “I wouldn’t even rape you” to the Labour MP Jess Phillips, argued in a now-deleted YouTube video that feminism had caused male mental health to deteriorate, prompting more mass killings.

“This is what feminism has wrought – a generation of men who do not know what to do, who are being demonised for what they are,” said Benjamin, who uses the name Sargon of Akkad on social media.

“Before your stupid social justice feminist bullshit, it didn’t happen on this scale. It’s crazy – this is a disease of the modern age,” Benjamin said in the 2014 video, recorded after the murder of six people in California that year by a 22-year-old man who said the killings were a response to women rejecting him sexually.

“You are responsible for perpetuating it, by disenfranchising these poor fucking guys who don’t have any options left,” Benjamin said.

The comments were condemned by the charity Solace Women’s Aid, which tweeted: “What does this say to the 1 in 5 women who experience sexual violence? #VAWG [violence against women and girls] is perpetuated by comments like these.”

BBC News - UKIP's Carl Benjamin not sorry for MP rape comments - misogyny lives on and calls feminism a cancer. What does this say to the 1 in 5 women who experience sexual violence? #VAWG is perpetuated by comments like thesehttps://t.co/ApiPUpHWwh — Solace Women's Aid (@SolaceWomensAid) April 21, 2019

Benjamin is second on Ukip’s regional list for MEP candidates in the south-west of England should next month’s European parliament elections take place in the UK.

He was among two candidates paraded by Ukip’s leader, Gerard Batten, at a fractious press conference last Thursday, at which Benjamin responded angrily to journalists’ questions about the tweet to Phillips, saying he was being accused of “crimes against political correctness”. Phillips has said she received 600 rape threats after Benjamin’s tweet.

In the video, framed as a response to comments about the California killings by Laci Green, a feminist YouTube activist, Benjamin insists a number of times that he does not in any way condone violence and says he believes the murderer, Elliot Rodger, was mentally ill.

But Benjamin also argues that feminism is to blame for making some men feel marginalised and “demonised in society”, and thus more likely to turn to violence.

“The question you and all of your stupid fucking feminist cultists need to be asking is, why are these men becoming misogynists in the first place? What is this feminist-run society doing to them that is causing them to go insane?” he says.

He adds: “When someone takes the option of absolute, insanely last resort, you have to wonder what kind of system is producing them. And I tell you what, Laci, it is a fucking feminist system that’s doing this.”

Rodger, who killed himself after the murders, wrote a manifesto in which he described himself as an “incel”, or “involuntary celibate” – a term popular in some anti-feminist circles to describe men rejected sexually by women.

In the video, Benjamin expresses some sympathy for the plight of such men, addressing Green directly to say: “You are not a man. You cannot possibly know what drives a man has. And when someone tells you, you say, ‘He’s a terrible person. Fuck you.’”

Ukip has been approached for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The survey of more than 2,000 UK voters also finds strikingly low numbers of people who believe that Brexit has benefited them or the country.

Just one in 10 believe leaving the EU has helped their personal financial situation, against 35% who say it has been bad for their finances, while just 9% say it has been good for the NHS, against 47% who say it has had a negative effect.

Ominously for prime minister Rishi Sunak, who backed Brexit and claimed it would be economically beneficial, only 7% of people think it has helped keep down prices in UK shops, against 63% who think Brexit has been a factor in fuelling inflation and the cost of living crisis.

The poll suggests that seven and a half years on from the referendum the British public now regards Brexit as a failure. Just 22% of voters believe it has been good for the UK in general.

The Vote Leave campaign led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove had promised that Brexit would boost the economy and trade, as well as bring back £350m a week into the NHS and allow the government to take back control of the UK’s borders.

James Crouch, head of policy and public affairs at Opinium, said the perception of Brexit being handled badly and having had negative effects on various aspect of UK life appeared to be spreading: “Public discontent at how Brexit has been handled by the government continues, with perceived failings even in areas previously seen as a potential benefit from leaving the EU.

“More than half (53%) of leave voters now think that Brexit has been bad for the UK’s ability to control immigration, piling even more pressure on an issue the government is vulnerable on. Despite this, Brexit is likely to be a secondary issue at the next election compared to the state of the economy and the NHS, which are the clear priority for voters.”

Robert Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said that while there was now evidence that negative perceptions of Brexit, particularly on the economy, could have an effect on votes at a general election, Brexit was very unlikely to play such a direct role as it did at the last two general elections.

Ford said: “Voters’ attention has shifted decisively elsewhere, with leave and remain voters alike focused on the domestic agenda of rising bills, struggling public services and weak economic growth.

“The appeal of ‘Get Brexit Done’ was not just about completing the long Brexit process but also about unblocking the political system and delivering on other long-neglected issues. Brexit got done, but this has not unblocked the political system, and troubles elsewhere have only deepened. Many of the voters who backed the Conservatives to deliver change now look convinced that achieving change requires ejecting the Conservatives.

“This shift in sentiment may be particularly stark among the ‘red wall’ voters who rallied most eagerly to Johnson’s banner four years ago, but have been most exposed to rising bills and collapsing public services since. The final act of Brexit may yet be the collapse of the Brexit electoral coalition.”

One of the key claims of the Brexiters was that leaving the EU’s single market and customs union would usher in a new era of global trade for the UK based on trade deals with other parts of the world. Many voters now seem to have concluded that Brexit has in fact been bad for trade. Some 49% think it has been bad for the ability of UK firms to import goods from outside the EU, while 15% think it has helped.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

To do so is a mistake. There is no set of features that exclusively defines movements, parties, and people that are called “populist”: the different people and parties that are placed in this category enjoy family resemblances of one to the other, but there is not a universal set of traits that is common to all of them.

There is, however, a particular kind of populist politics that originated in the United States in the 19th century, which has recurred there in the 20th and 21st centuries – and which began to appear in western Europe in the 1970s. In the past few decades, these campaigns and parties have converged in their concerns, and in the wake of the Great Recession, they have surged.

The kind of populism that runs through American history, and has been transplanted to Europe, cannot be defined exclusively in terms of right, left or centre: it includes both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, the Front National in France and Podemos in Spain. There are rightwing, leftwing and centrist populist parties. It is not an ideology, but a political logic – a way of thinking about politics. In his book on American populism, The Populist Persuasion, the historian Michael Kazin describes populism as “a language whose speakers conceive of ordinary people as a noble assemblage not bounded narrowly by class; view their elite opponents as self-serving and undemocratic; and seek to mobilise the former against the latter.”

That’s a good start. It doesn’t describe people like Ronald Reagan or Vladimir Putin, both of whom have sometimes been called “populist”, but it does describe the logic of the parties, movements, and candidates, from the US’s People’s Party of 1892 to Marine Le Pen’s Front National of 2016. I would, however, take Kazin’s characterisation one step further and distinguish between leftwing populists such as Bernie Sanders and Podemos’s Pablo Iglesias, and rightwing populists such as Trump and Le Pen.

Leftwing populists champion the people against an elite or an establishment. Theirs is a vertical politics of the bottom and middle, arrayed against the top. Rightwing populists champion the people against an elite that they accuse of favouring a third group, which can consist, for instance, of immigrants, Islamists, or African American militants. Rightwing populism is triadic: it looks upward, but also down upon an out group.

Leftwing populism is historically different to socialist or social democratic movements. It is not a politics of class conflict, and it does not necessarily seek the abolition of capitalism. It is also different to a progressive or liberal politics that seeks to reconcile the interests of opposing classes and groups. It assumes a basic antagonism between the people and an elite at the heart of its politics.

Rightwing populism, meanwhile, is different to a conservatism that primarily identifies with the business classes against their critics and antagonists below. In its American and western European versions, it is also different to an authoritarian conservatism that aims to subvert democracy. It operates within a democratic context.

Just as there is no common ideology that defines populism, there is no one constituency that comprises “the people”. They can be blue-collar workers, shopkeepers, or students burdened by debt; they can be the poor or the middle class. Equally, there is no common identification of “the establishment”. The exact referents of “the people” and “the elite” do not define populism, what defines it is the conflict between the two (or, in the case of rightwing populism, the three).

Populist movements have flourished in opposition, and have suffered identity crises when they have entered government

The conflict itself turns on a set of demands that the populists make of the elite – demands that the populists believe the establishment will be unwilling to grant them. Sanders wanted “Medicare for all” and a $15 minimum wage. If he had wanted the Affordable Care Act to cover hearing aids, or to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $7.75, that would not have defined a clash between the people and the establishment. If Trump were to demand an increase in guards along the Mexican border, or if Denmark’s rightwing People’s Party campaigned on a mere reduction in asylum-seekers, these demands would not open up a gulf between the people and the elite. But promising a wall that the Mexican government will pay for or the total cessation of immigration – that does establish a frontier.

These kinds of demands define the clash between the people and the establishment. If they are granted in whole or even in part, or if populists abandon them as too ambitious – as Syriza did with its demands for renegotiation of Greece’s debt – then the populist movement is likely to dissipate or to morph into a normal political party or candidacy. In this sense, American and western European populist movements have flourished when they are in opposition, and have suffered identity crises when they have entered government.

Populist campaigns and parties often function as warning signs of a political crisis. In both Europe and the US, populist movements have been most successful at times when people see the prevailing political norms – which are preserved and defended by the existing establishment – as being at odds with their own hopes, fears, and concerns. The populists express these neglected concerns and frame them in a politics that pits the people against an intransigent elite. By doing so, they become catalysts for political change.

Populist campaigns and parties, by nature, point to problems through demands that are unlikely to be realised in the present political circumstances. In the case of some rightwing populists, these demands are laced with bigotry or challenge democratic norms. In other cases, they are clouded with misinformation. But they still point to tears in the fabric of accepted political wisdom.

In recent decades, as the great postwar boom has stalled, the major parties on both sides of the Atlantic, have embraced a neoliberal agenda of free movement of capital and labour to achieve prosperity. Leaders have favoured increased immigration, only to find that American voters were up in arms about illegal immigration, and European voters were up in arms about immigrant communities they regarded as seedbeds of crime and, later, terrorism. In continental Europe, the major parties embraced the idea of the single currency only to find that it fell into disfavour during the Great Recession. In the United States, both parties embraced “free trade” deals only to discover that much of the public did not support these treaties.

In the last decades of the 19th century, as the People’s Party was erupting on the American scene, Europe was seeing the emergence of social democratic parties inspired by Karl Marx’s theory of socialism. Over the next 70 years, Europe would become home to an array of parties on the left, centre and right, but it would not witness anything resembling American populism until the 1970s.

Like the original People’s Party in the US, the European parties operated within the electoral arena and championed the “people” against an “establishment” or “elite”. The French Front National says that it represents the “little people” and the “forgotten members” against the “caste”. In Finland, the Finns Party says that it wants “a democracy that rests on the consent of the people and does not emanate from elites or bureaucrats”. In Spain, Podemos champions the “gente” against the “casta”. In Italy, Beppe Grillo of the Five Star Movement rails against what he calls the “three destroyers” – journalists, industrialists, and politicians. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders’ Party for Freedom represents “Henk and Ingrid” against “the political elite”.

The first European populist parties were rightwing. They accused the elites of coddling communists, welfare recipients, or immigrants. As a result, the term “populist” in Europe became used pejoratively by leftwing and centrist politicians and academics. In the last decade, however, leftwing populist parties have arisen in Spain and Greece that direct their ire against the establishment in their country or against the EU headquarters in Brussels.

The main difference between US and European populists is that while American parties and campaigns come and go quickly, some European populist parties have been around for decades. That is primarily because many European nations have multi-party systems, and many of the countries have proportional representation that allows smaller parties to maintain a foothold even when they are polling in single digits.

Populist movements themselves do not often achieve their own objectives. Their demands may be co-opted by the major parties, or they may be thoroughly rejected. But they do roil the waters. They signal that the prevailing political ideology is not working and the standard worldview is breaking down.

No one, not even the man himself, expected Donald Trump to get the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Similarly, no one, including Bernie Sanders, expected that through the California primary in June, the Vermont senator would still be challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

Trump’s success was initially attributed to his showmanship and celebrity. But as he won primary after primary, political experts observed him playing on racist opposition to Barack Obama’s presidency or exploiting a latent sympathy for fascism among working-class white Americans. Sanders’s success invited less speculation, but commentators tended to dismiss him as a utopian and point to the airy idealism of millennial voters. If that were not sufficient explanation for his success, they also emphasised Hillary Clinton’s weakness as a frontrunner.

It makes more sense, however, to understand Trump and Sanders’s success as the latest chapter in the history of American populism. While strands of populism go back to the American revolution, it really begins with the People’s Party of the 1890s, which set the precedent for movements that have popped up periodically ever since. In the US, in contrast to Europe, these campaigns have burst forth suddenly and unexpectedly. Despite usually being short-lived, they have, nevertheless, had an outsized impact. And while they may seem unusual at the time, they are very much part of the political fabric of the nation.

While the history of American politics is riven with conflicts – over slavery, prohibition, abortion, intervention abroad – it is also dominated for long stretches by an underlying consensus about government’s role in the economy and abroad.

American politics is structured to sustain such prevailing worldviews. Its characteristics of winner-takes-all, first-past-the-post, single-member districts have encouraged a two‑party system. Third-party candidates are often dismissed as “spoilers”. Moreover, in deciding on whom to nominate in party primaries, voters and party bigwigs have generally taken electability into account, and in the general election, candidates have generally tried to capture the centre and to stay away from being branded “extremist”. As a result of this two-party tilt towards the centre, sharp political differences over underlying socioeconomic issues have tended to become blunted or even to be ignored, particularly in presidential elections.

But there are times, when, in the face of dramatic changes in society and the economy, or in America’s place in the world, voters have suddenly become responsive to politicians or movements that raise issues that major parties have either downplayed or overlooked completely.

The rise of the People’s Party was the first major salvo against the worldview of laissez-faire capitalism; the Louisiana governor Huey Long’s “Share Our Wealth” movement, which emerged in the wake of Franklin Roosevelt’s election in 1932, helped pressure Roosevelt to address economic inequality. Together, these movements established the framework that Bernie Sanders, who described himself both as a democratic socialist and as a progressive, would adopt during his 2016 campaign. Equally, the populist campaigns of George Wallace in the 1960s and Pat Buchanan in the 1990s foreshadowed the candidacy of Donald Trump.

During their heyday in the late 19th century, the populists of the People’s Party had a profound effect on American and – as it turned out – Latin American and European politics. It developed the logic of populism: the concept of a “people” arrayed against an elite that refused to grant necessary reforms. In American politics, the organisation was an early sign of the inadequacy of the two major parties’ views of government and the economy.

The populists were the first to call for government to regulate and even nationalise industries that were integral to the economy, like the railroads; they wanted government to reduce the economic inequality that capitalism, when left to its own devices, was creating, and they wanted to reduce the power of business in determining the outcome of elections. Populism had an immediate impact on the politics of some progressive Democrats, and even on Republicans such as Theodore Roosevelt. Eventually, much of the populist agenda was incorporated into Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal and into the outlook of New Deal liberalism.

In May 1891, the legend goes, some members of the Kansas Farmers Alliance, riding back home from a national convention in Cincinnati, came up with the term “populist” to describe the political views that they and other alliance groups in the west and south were developing. The next year, the alliance groups joined hands with the Knights of Labor, then the main workers’ organisation in the United States, to form the People’s Party, which, over the next two years, challenged the most basic assumptions that guided Republicans and Democrats in Washington. The party would be short-lived, but its example would establish the basis for populism in the United States and Europe.

At the time, the leading Republicans and Democrats in the United States were revelling in the progress of American industry and finance. They believed in the self-regulating market as an instrument of prosperity and individual opportunity, and thought that the role of government should be minimal. Grover Cleveland, who was president from 1884 to 1888 and then from 1892 to 1896, railed against government “paternalism”. Public sector intervention, he declared in his second inaugural address, “stifles the spirit of true Americanism”; its “functions,” he stated, “do not include the support of the people”. Government’s principal role was to maintain a “sound and stable currency” through upholding the gold standard.

But during these years, farmers in the south and the plains suffered from a sharp drop in agricultural prices. Farm prices fell two-thirds in the midwest and south from 1870 to 1890. The plains, which prospered in the early 1880s, were hit by a ruinous drought in the late 1880s. But unsympathetic railroads, which enjoyed monopoly status, raised the cost of transporting farm produce. Many farmers in the south and the plains states could barely break even. The small family farm gave way to the large “bonanza” farm, often owned by companies based in the east. Salaries were threatened by low-wage immigrants from China, Japan, Portugal and Italy. Farmers who retained their land were burdened by debt. In Kansas, 45% of the land had become owned by banks.

The first populists saw themselves representing the “people”, including farmers and blue-collar workers, against the “money power” or “plutocracy”. That was reflected in their early programmes, which included a demand for the incorporation and recognition of labour unions alongside demands for railroad regulation, an end to land speculation, and easy money (through the replacement or supplementing of the gold standard) to ease the burden of debt that the farmers suffered from. Except for a few scattered leaders, the populists were not socialists. They wanted to reform rather than abolish capitalism, and their agent of reform was not the socialist working class, but the loosely conceived idea of “the people”.

When their demands – which also included a graduated income tax and political reforms to establish the secret ballot and the direct election of senators – proved too radical and far-reaching for the major parties, the People’s Party was created in 1892, and nominated a candidate for president. “We seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of ‘the plain people’, with whose class it originated,” the party’s first platform declared. “We believe that the powers of government – in other words, of the people – should be expanded … as rapidly and as far as the good sense of an intelligent people and the teachings of experience shall justify, to the end that oppression, injustice, and poverty shall eventually cease in the land.”

But in the 1880s and early 1890s, populist politics was primarily directed upward at the plutocrats

There was always a more conservative strain within the populist movement. In the south, some groups cooperated with the parallel national alliance of black farmers, but others did not. Populists also favoured the expulsion of Chinese immigrants, whom businesses had imported to provide cheap labour on western farms and railroads, and their support for that policy was often accompanied by racist rhetoric. But in the 1880s and early 1890s, populist politics was primarily directed upward at the plutocrats.

In the 1892 election, the People’s Party did remarkably well. Its woefully underfunded presidential candidate received 8% of the vote and carried five states. In the 1894 election, the People’s Party’s candidates for the House of Representatives won 10% of the vote. The party elected four congressmen, four senators, 21 state executives and 465 state legislators. With its base in the south and the west, and with Grover Cleveland wildly unpopular, the People’s Party looked to be on its way to challenging the Democrats as the second party. However, the election of 1894 turned out to be the party’s swansong.

In the end, the populists were done in by the dynamics of the two-party system. In the plains states, anger against Cleveland turned voters back to the more electable Republicans. In the south, Democrats subdued the People’s Party by a combination of co-option and, in response to the willingness of some populists to court the black vote, vicious race-baiting.

As liberal critics would later point out, the People’s Party had within it strains of antisemitism, racism, and nativism, particularly towards Chinese people, but these were at best secondary elements. Until the movement began to disintegrate, the original People’s Party was primarily a movement of the left. The first major instances of rightwing populism would come in the 1930s – from the Catholic priest and radio host Father Charles Coughlin – and then, in the 1960s, with George Wallace’s presidential campaigns.

Wallace, the Democratic governor of Alabama, helped to doom the New Deal majority and lay the foundations for the Reagan realignment of 1980. He created a new rightwing variety of populism – what the sociologist Donald Warren called “middle American radicalism” – which would migrate into the Republican party and become the basis of Donald Trump’s challenge to Republican orthodoxy in 2016.

The New Deal had rested on a tacit alliance between liberals and conservative southern Democrats, the latter of which resisted any legislation that might challenge white supremacy. As the party of Abraham Lincoln, the Republicans had traditionally been receptive to black civil rights, and the Republican leadership in Congress supported the Democratic president Lyndon Johnson’s Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965. The Arizona Republican senator Barry Goldwater was an early dissenter, but in the 1964 presidential election, Johnson easily defeated him. Johnson’s victory did not, however, signal widespread support for his civil rights initiatives, and after he passed the Voting Rights Act and introduced legislation known as the “War on Poverty”, a popular backlash grew. Wallace turned the backlash into a populist crusade.

Wallace would eventually make his name as an arch-segregationist, but he was initially a populist Democrat for whom race was strictly a secondary consideration. He initially ran for governor in 1958 as a New Deal Democrat and lost against a candidate backed by the Ku Klux Klan. After that, he pledged: “I will never be outniggered again.”

In 1962, Wallace ran again and this time he won as a proponent of “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever”. In 1963, he gained notoriety when he attempted to block two black students from registering at the University of Alabama. In 1964, he ran in the Democratic primaries in Wisconsin, Indiana and Maryland, winning about a third of the vote – as high as 43% in Maryland, where he carried 15 of 23 counties. In 1968, he ran as an independent against the Republican Richard Nixon and the Democrat Hubert Humphrey. In early October, Wallace was ahead of Humphrey in the polls – in the end, he got 13.5% of the vote and carried five states in the south. In 1972, he ran as a Democrat, and stood a chance of taking the nomination when, in May, an assassin shot and crippled him while he was campaigning for the Maryland primary.

Wallace emphasised his opposition to racial integration, but he framed it as a defence of the average (white) American against the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. Big government was imposing its will on the average person. Appearing on Meet the Press in 1967, Wallace summed up his candidacy:

There’s a backlash against big government in this country. This is a movement of the people … And I think that if the politicians get in the way, a lot of them are going to get run over by this average man in the street – this man in the textile mill, this man in the steel mill, this barber, this beautician, the policeman on the beat … the little businessman.

Wallace opposed busing – the practice of assigning children to particular state schools in order to redress racial segregation – because it was breaking up working-class neighbourhoods, and he attacked the white liberals who promoted it as hypocrites who refused to subject their children to what they insisted that the children of less affluent families must endure. “They are building a bridge over the Potomac for all the white liberals fleeing to Virginia,” he declared.

Wallace was not, however, a political conservative. On domestic issues that did not directly touch on race, he ran as a New Deal Democrat. In his 1968 campaign brochure, he boasted that in Alabama, he had increased spending on education, welfare, roads and agriculture.

In 1976, the Donald Warren published a study of “middle American radicals” (MARs). On the basis of extensive surveys conducted between 1971 and 72 and in 1975, Warren defined a distinct political group that was neither left nor right, liberal nor conservative. MARs “feel the middle class has been seriously neglected,” Warren wrote. They see “government as favouring both the rich and poor simultaneously”.

Warren’s MARs held conservative positions on poverty and racial issues. They rejected busing and welfare agencies as examples of “the rich [giving] in to the demands of the poor, and the middle-income people have to pay the bill”. They disliked the national government, but they also thought corporations “have too much power” and were “too big”. They favoured many liberal programmes. They wanted government to guarantee jobs to everyone. They supported price (but not wage) control, Medicare, some kind of national health insurance, federal aid to education and social security.

Warren found that MARs represented about a quarter of the electorate. They were on average more male than female; they had a high-school but not a college education; their income fell in the middle, or slightly below it; they had skilled or semi-skilled blue-collar occupations, or clerical or sales jobs – and they were the most likely demographic group to vote for George Wallace.

In other words, Wallace’s base was among voters who saw themselves as middle class – the American equivalent of “the people” – and who believed themselves to be locked in conflict with those below and above.

Forty years later, Trump portrays himself as an enemy of free trade treaties, runaway shops, and illegal immigration and as the champion of the “silent majority” – a term borrowed from Nixon – against the “special interests” and the “establishment” of both parties. “The silent majority is back, and it’s not silent. It’s aggressive,” Trump declared last year. At rallies, his campaign has given out signs that read: “The silent majority stands with Trump.”

In January, just before the Iowa caucuses, Trump’s campaign ran a television advertisement titled The Establishment. Seated behind a desk, Trump looked into the camera and said: “The establishment, the media, the special interest, the lobbyists, the donors, they’re all against me. I’m self-funding my campaign. I don’t owe anybody anything. I only owe it to the American people to do a great job. They are really trying to stop me.”

Akshata Murty, who married Sunak in 2009, is the daughter of one of India’s most successful entrepreneurs. Her father co-founded the technology giant Infosys, and her shares in the company are worth £430m, making her one of the wealthiest women in Britain, with a fortune larger than the Queen’s.

Sunak is bound by the ministerial code, which requires him to declare any financial interests that are “relevant” to his responsibilities, and which could conflict with his duty to the public. Ministers must also declare those interests of their close family, including siblings, parents, spouse and in-laws, which might give rise to a conflict.

But Sunak’s entry mentions no family members other than his wife, and only refers to her ownership of a small, UK-based venture capital company. Research by the Guardian shows that Murty and her family hold many other interests, including:

A combined £1.7bn shareholding in Infosys, which employs thousands of staff in the UK and has held contracts with government ministries and public bodies.

A £900m-a-year joint venture with Amazon in India, through an investment vehicle owned by Murty’s father.

A direct shareholding by Murty in a UK firm which runs Jamie Oliver and Wendy’s burger restaurants in India.

Five other UK companies where Murty is a director or direct shareholder, including a Mayfair outfitter that supplies the tailcoats worn by pupils at Eton College.

Sir Alistair Graham, a former chair of the committee on standards in public life, which acts as a watchdog for UK public office holders, said it was vital that Sunak declare the financial interests of himself and his close family given “the chancellor’s capacity to determine the government’s financial and business policies”.

“He seems to have taken the most minimalist approach possible to this requirement. Perhaps Rishi Sunak should carefully read the ‘Seven principles of Public Life’ to make sure he is fulfilling the two principles of ‘Honesty and Leadership’.”

Sunak and Murty have not responded directly to requests for comment. The Treasury said all the proper procedures for declaring interests had been followed, and that decisions about what to declare were not taken by ministers themselves but by civil servants and independent advisers.

A Treasury spokesperson said the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministerial interests “confirmed he is completely satisfied with the chancellor’s propriety of arrangements and that he has followed the ministerial code to the letter in his declaration of interests”.

Ministers are held to a higher level of disclosure than MPs. The code of conduct states they must provide a “full list in writing of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict”. This list “should also cover interests of the minister’s spouse or partner and close family which might be thought to give rise to a conflict”. Advisers then decide what to put on the official list of ministers’ interests.

Sunak and family’s financial interests

After becoming chief secretary to the Treasury in July 2019, Sunak revealed for the first time that he was the beneficiary of a blind trust. He also included Murty for the first time, stating: “Mr Sunak’s wife owns a venture capital investment company, Catamaran Ventures UK Ltd.” There is no information about his own family or his wife’s parents and siblings.

Catamaran represents just a small part of the interests held by the chancellor’s wife. The source of her extraordinary wealth is a stake in Infosys, founded by her father NR Narayana Murthy (his children have dropped the “h” from their surname).

According to the Infosys annual report, Akshata Murty owns a 0.91% stake in the group; that stake is currently worth £430m. Each year, her shares entitle her to millions in dividends. Of all the family, only her brother, Rohan Murty, owns more of the company. The combined family holding is worth an estimated £1.7bn.

Murty’s holding is not secret, and it is not clear why it was not declared in the register. The interest could be seen to present a conflict, because Infosys is a contractor to the UK government and publicly funded organisations.

Since 2015, the firm has won taxpayer-funded work worth £22m, according to filings on the government’s contracts website. These include a £5m deal with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, awarded in 2018, which runs until 2021.

Infosys has also worked for the Home Office and has signed a framework agreement with Whitehall, which means it can be awarded contracts without competition. The company employs an estimated 10,000 staff in the UK, some of whom benefited from Sunak’s furlough scheme.

The Murty family has invested part of the wealth created by Infosys through Catamaran Ventures, which takes stakes in growth businesses. It is understood Murty has no financial or legal interest in the Indian arm of Catamaran. However, the fund benefits other family members, including her father. One of its most successful deals is a partnership with the online retailer Amazon.

Together they own Cloudtail, one of the largest sellers on Amazon’s Indian marketplace, with revenues of over £900m last year. The investment could be seen as a conflict of interest, given that the chancellor is responsible for decisions about how to tax large digital corporations, such as Amazon, in the UK.

Murty set up Catamaran’s UK arm with Sunak in order to invest her private wealth. He transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament and she is now the sole owner. Through it, she has invested in a clutch of start-up businesses. What Sunak has not declared is that his wife also holds direct shareholdings – in her own name, rather than through Catamaran – in at least six UK companies.

She is an investor and director at the gentlemen’s outfitters New & Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats, and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each.

Murty also holds shares in a UK business which operates Jamie’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and gyms operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both Digme and New & Lingwood have furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company co-founded by her brother, lists Murty as a director of its UK arm.

Before entering the Treasury, Sunak met the government’s then head of propriety and ethics, Helen MacNamara, to decide what needed to be declared, a government source said. MacNamara reviewed the interests of Sunak and Murty and confirmed at the time, and again recently, that she was satisfied with what had been registered. Sir Alex Allan, the former independent adviser on minister’s interests, also approved the disclosures, according to the source.

Allan resigned from his post last week following a dispute over the publication of a report into allegations of bullying by the home secretary, Priti Patel.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Files released to the National Archives in Kew on Friday show how UK ministers favoured the US shuttle launch system for military satellites over Ariane rockets.

A 1983 memo from the Ministry of Defence to the prime minister warns there is “French pressure on us to be ‘European’ and go for Ariane”.

Margaret Thatcher agreed that it was better to go with the American shuttle, which was cheaper and had a better safety record.

The MoD wanted to send two Skynet 4 military satellites, manufactured by BAE and Marconi, into orbit to provide communications across Europe and the Atlantic.

The shuttle launch was priced at £58m – £23m cheaper than Ariane.

“We [currently] rely on American cover for the command and control of all our naval forces outside the UK, including submarines and surface task groups and our forces in Falklands, Lebanon and Berlin,” the letter, highlighting the UK’s reliance on US goodwill, informed the prime minister.

The French Socialist prime minister, Pierre Mauroy, wrote to Thatcher pleading for the decision to be reconsidered and offered to reduce the cost. The issue, prefiguring the Westland helicopter affair, escalated into a diplomatic row over the UK’s international priorities.

Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary, wrote to Thatcher in December 1983 advising caution. “If we opt for the shuttle,” he said, “we must expect the French to make a fuss.

“Indeed, in the wake of the [European Community] Athens summit, they may be looking for an issue to illustrate an alleged lack of European commitment by the UK and may therefore choose to make even more of an adverse Skynet decision than would otherwise have been the case.

“There is therefore a case for keeping the French in the dark for a time about a decision to go for shuttle in an attempt to distance it from post-Athens discord.”

Eventually the French were told the US bid had been chosen. When the next military satellite launch in 1986, however, Ariane was favoured. After the Challenger shuttle disaster, a No 10 memo stated there “is no other option but to use Ariane”.

Another top secret prime ministerial file on Project Moonflower is worded in such an obscure manner that its so-called black subject is not immediately apparent.

President Ronald Reagan was offering Downing Street a briefing on “highly sensitive … technology with a view to the United States and the United Kingdom working together on it”.

“Dear Margaret,” a 1986 US telegram recorded, “I am delighted to hear that you will be able to see Cap [Casapar Weinberger, the US defence decretary] to discuss the special program I wrote you about … I look forward to receiving your reaction. Sincerely, Ron.”

In a top secret personal message, on which someone wrote in faint pencil “STEALTH”, an enthused prime minister wrote back after the secret meeting: “Dear Ron, I was immensely impressed by your splendid achievement: three cheers for America!

“I was also very touched by the generosity of the offer of participation which [Cap] brought. It brings home once again who our real friends are … I am so much looking forward to seeing you in Tokyo. With warmest best wishes, yours sincerely, Margaret.”

The offer of transatlantic cooperation on Stealth technology – which disguises an aircraft’s presence from radar detection – was one the MoD declined to take up.

An MoD letter in December 1986 to Charles Powell, the prime minister’s foreign affairs adviser, about Project Moonflower informed him that “Mr Weinberger has offered us a chance to purchase the current US aircraft but we have replied that we would not wish to actually buy hardware while the programme remains strictly black [secret].

“… [George] Younger [defence secretary] raised the subject very briefly with Mr Weinberger this morning … just sufficiently to test whether Weinberger is disappointed at our reaction so far. He certainly does not seem to be.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Britain currently uses a mix of imperial and metric measurements, with speed limits in miles per hour and milk and beer bought in pints.

The prime minister, under increasing pressure after further damaging revelations in the Partygate scandal, is expected to announce next week that British shops will be allowed to sell products in pounds and ounces to coincide with celebrations for the monarch’s 70 years on the throne.

A Cabinet source told the Mirror: “As the British people have been happy to use both imperial and metric measurements in their daily life it is good for the government to reflect that now we are free to change our regulations accordingly.”

Since 1995, goods sold in Europe have had to display metric weights and measurements. And since 2000 when the EU’s weights and measures directive came into force, traders have been legally required to use metric units for the sale by weight or measure of fresh produce, which became a recurring issue for Eurosceptics about Brussels’ supposed interference in British life.

While it is still legal to price goods in pounds and ounces, these have to be displayed alongside the price in grams and kilograms.

Steven Thoburn, a greengrocer from Sunderland, famously waged a three-year legal battle after being prosecuted for selling in pounds and ounces on his market stall in 2001. The dispute, which was taken to the House of Lords, stemmed from the sale of a bunch of bananas worth 34p.

During the 2019 general election campaign, Johnson pledged that he would bring back imperial units in shops.

He claimed that measuring in pounds and ounces was an “ancient liberty” as he heralded a “new era of generosity and tolerance” towards traditional measurements.

Only three other countries, the US, Myanmar and Liberia, use the imperial system on a daily basis.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

This Sceptred Isle, which was first announced last year and has now been commissioned by Sky, will be directed by Michael Winterbottom, who will also co-write, while Tim Shipman, the political editor of the Sunday Times, will act as a consultant.

Starting with his appointment as prime minister, the five-part drama will recount the first Covid-19 cases in the UK, through to Johnson falling ill with the virus, and the arrival of his son.

The series will trace the impact on Britain from the pandemic, and the response of scientists, nurses and doctors.

It is based on the first-hand testimony of people inside No 10 Downing Street, the Department of Health, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), and from hospitals and care homes across the country.

Winterbottom has co-written the series with Kieron Quirke, and will direct all five episodes.

He said: “The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic will be remembered forever. A time when the country came together to battle an invisible enemy. A time when people were more aware than ever of the importance of community.

“Our series weaves together countless true stories – from Boris Johnson in Number 10 to frontline workers around the country – chronicling the efforts of scientists, doctors, care home workers and policymakers to protect us from the virus.”

Global producer and distributor Fremantle has signed a first-look deal with Winterbottom and his production company Revolution Films, which will develop and produce scripted series and films, with Fremantle co-producing and distributing the projects worldwide.

The deal is done in collaboration with Richard Brown and his company, Passenger, with Brown and Melissa Parmenter from Revolution Films serving as executive producers on the political drama

Zai Bennett, managing director of content at Sky UK, said: “Covid-19 has presented once-in-a-generation challenges to the world, and in the UK the resilience and fortitude of the public over the past year has been nothing short of extraordinary.

“Portraying NHS staff and key workers on the frontlines of the extraordinary fight, to those in government facing unprecedented challenges, Michael Winterbottom has a clear and compelling vision in telling this remarkable story.

“The incredible creative talent Fremantle have assembled including the central performance from Kenneth Branagh will make This Sceptred Isle a drama we are proud to be part of telling.”

Brown added: “Michael is a master of weaving compelling drama from factual stories and he has an undeniable, distinct vision for this project. He and Kieron have written remarkable and meticulously researched scripts which powerfully dramatise these extraordinary events that continue to affect us all.”

The series will begin filming in early 2021 and is expected to premiere on Sky Atlantic and Now TV in the autumn of 2022.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Sharma has not had his test result back but he started feeling unwell at the House of Commons dispatch box on Wednesday afternoon and he has since gone into a 14-day isolation period.

Downing Street said Sharma was in a face-to-face meeting with the prime minister and chancellor about the economy before cabinet on Tuesday morning. The cabinet room has been deep-cleaned.

Johnson’s official spokesman said the men were physically distanced, sitting at least 2 metres apart at all times, but did not wear face masks during the meeting.

He refused to say explicitly that Johnson would re-enter self-isolation if the business secretary had a positive result, and Johnson was asked to by the new test and trace service. He said only that the prime minister would “follow medical advice”.

00:01:00 Business secretary Alok Sharma appears unwell in House of Commons chamber – video

Johnson has already had coronavirus but the guidelines for test and trace state that people have to self-isolate for 14 days if they have had contact with someone who has tested positive, regardless of whether they have been ill before or not.

The prime minister and chancellor may be able to avoid that outcome if the ministers are adamant that they were at least 2 metres apart at all times, but a refusal to do so could also undermine trust in the system.

The No 10 spokesman could not say whether Sharma’s test result would be returned on Thursday. The test and trace system only kicks in to find contacts of someone who is ill when a positive outcome is recorded.

Whether or not Sharma tests positive, his suspected illness is likely to cause concern about the government’s decision to bring back parliament in its physical form, after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link.

Many MPs have protested against the new arrangements, which have resulted in them queuing around the parliamentary estate while complying with the physical distancing rules in order to vote.

During the debate, after Sharma was seen wiping his face with a handkerchief several times, his Labour shadow, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water. Sharma also appeared sweaty and sounded hoarse on Tuesday, according to one fellow MP, when he voted to abolish hybrid parliamentary measures.

During one vote, the minister voted straight after the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and immediately before the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock.

In another vote on the substantive motion, Sharma queued to vote immediately after Saqib Bhatti, the Conservative MP for Meriden, and just before Paul Scully, a Tory business minister.

Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the development was “just awful”, adding: “The government stopped MPs from working from home and asked us to return to a building where social distancing is impossible. MPs are travelling home to every part of the country tonight. Reckless doesn’t even begin to describe it.”

Digital voting in the Commons was ended on Tuesday after MPs approved a government motion introduced by the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, despite widespread objections.

The Labour MP Karl Turner said he had asked the Health and Safety Executive to conduct an urgent risk assessment of working conditions in parliament.

He said MPs having to “huddle together” on escalators on the parliamentary estate while lining up to vote were among a number of “unsafe practices”.

A string of cabinet ministers and senior officials have come down with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, including Johnson, who was treated in intensive care.

Matt Hancock, the health secretary, Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, Dominic Cummings, the senior No 10 adviser, and Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, were also all unwell with coronavirus in late March or early April.

The first MP to fall ill with the virus was Nadine Dorries, a health minister, who tested positive in March.

A House of Commons spokesperson said: “The house’s priority is to ensure that those on the estate are safe while business is facilitated.

Liz Truss signed a “historic” deal with Japan as trade secretary in October 2020, describing it as a “landmark moment for Britain”. It was claimed it would boost trade by billions of pounds and help the UK recover from the pandemic.

However, figures collated by the Department for International Trade show exports to Japan fell from £12.3bn to £11.9bn in the year to June 2022. Exports in goods fell 4.9% to £6.1bn and services fell 2% to £5.8bn.

The decline is a significant setback for supporters of Brexit who claimed global trade with non-EU countries would help compensate for any losses from leaving the single market.

One such deal, with Australia, was criticised earlier this month by the former environment secretary George Eustice, who said it was “not actually a very good deal for the UK”.

Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour’s shadow secretary for international trade, said: “Falling trade with Japan is irrefutable evidence that ministers are not delivering for UK exporters.

“The Conservatives have no trade policy worthy of the name and ministers are failing to stand up for UK interests in negotiations.

“This is making the huge economic damage they have caused even worse.”

The new figures follow evidence that Britain’s economy is set to struggle compared to its international counterparts.

Apart from Russia, it will be the weakest performer of the world’s big economies next year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

It also comes with Rishi Sunak under pressure inside Whitehall and among his own MPs over his current Brexit plans. He was forced to deny claims last week that he wanted to pursue a softer, “Swiss-style” Brexit that would see Britain forge a closer relationship with the EU.

However, he is now facing calls from officials to drop plans that would automatically tear up EU-derived laws by the end of next year.

The Observer has been told that the “Brexit freedoms” bill is putting such a burden on civil servants that even working through weekends has not left them enough time to examine all the implications of the plan.

Officials are having to comb through current laws because of a “sunset clause” in the retained EU law bill, under which any law not “reviewed or revoked” by the end of 2023 will be removed.

Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, said the bill “could leave the UK a more dangerous and less fair place”.

“Prospect members in safety critical industries are concerned that this bill could remove important safeguards in the name of cutting red tape,” he said. “It also puts huge pressure on departmental workloads. It seems the prime minister may be forced to plough on with this bill to appease hardliners in his party. We must not end up in a situation where people’s rights at work are used as red meat to appease a small cabal of MPs.”

The performance of the Japan deal heaps further pressure on government claims that Britain can secure a “Brexit dividend”.

Department for International Trade officials said in 2020 the UK-Japan comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) offered significant advantages beyond the previous EU arrangement.

It claimed the estimated boost to trade between the UK and Japan could be £15bn. But in its first year since coming into force on 1 January 2021, total trade between the countries was £23.7bn, against £24.9bn in 2020, a fall of about 5%. The most recent figures show a slight recovery in total trade between the two countries.

Minako Morita-Jaeger, a senior research fellow in international trade at Sussex University business school and a policy research fellow of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, said the government had “oversold” the UK-Japan trade agreement and it did not offer significant economic advantages over the previous EU deal. She said the early trade data did not appear encouraging.

A comparative analysis of UK-Japan trade figures for 2020 and 2021 by Morita-Jaeger and a colleague states: “In all cases but one, Japanese exports and imports of goods and services with the UK performed worse than the equivalent flows with the EU or the rest of the world.”

Morita-Jaeger said Japanese businesses had used the UK as a gateway to Europe since the 1980s.

She said research had shown firms there were having difficulties navigating the UK-EU trade framework and were considering expanding their business functions, including headquarters and production, in the EU. While the UK said the deal with Japan offered bespoke benefits, a Japanese ministry of affairs document suggests it largely rolled over the previous EU agreement.

Ministers now face mounting scrutiny over free trade deals around the world, with the total trade and goods deficit £23.7bn in July to September 2022, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics.

Economic experts now accept that Brexit will have an adverse impact on international trade as businesses struggle with the increased customs checks and bureaucracy involved in exporting to Europe.

The Office for Budget Responsibility report published this month assumes UK trading intensity will be 15% lower in the long run.

It says: “The latest evidence suggests that Brexit has had a significant adverse impact on UK trade.”

It was reported last week that senior government figures were considering a Swiss-style relationship with the EU, with fewer trading barriers. Prime minister Rishi Sunak said the UK would not pursue any post-Brexit relationship that “relies on alignment with EU laws”.

The Japanese Embassy in London said the deal “provides stability for Japanese and British companies to continue their business and trading activities with each other after Brexit”.

A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “Global trade has been significantly impacted by Covid-19, and while trade flows can fluctuate in the short term due a variety of factors, our analysis shows that the UK-Japan CEPA could increase trade by nearly £16bn and increase UK wages by £800m by 2035 compared to not having a deal.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The speech put immigration at the heart of Ukip's campaign for the European and local elections, which Farage followed with a declaration that he would resign if his party failed to win a seat in parliament in 2015. But he appeared to concede some concerns raised by Ukip about the scale of immigration from Bulgaria and Romania after the lifting of transitional controls in January may have been unfounded. The greatest potential immigration threat now came from the eurozone, Farage claimed.

""In scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable,"" Farage told his audience in Torquay. ""Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don't hear English spoken any more. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren.""

Asked at his press conference to justify the comments, Farage cited a recent experience on a rush-hour train leaving Charing Cross. ""It was a stopper going out and we stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green, it was not until we got past Grove Park that I could hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage,"" he said. ""Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes it does."" Asked why he minded people speaking in foreign languages, he replied: ""I don't understand them … I don't feel very comfortable in that situation and I don't think the majority of British people do.""

With some commentators tipping Ukip to win the Europeans elections, even though polls have yet to show it overtaking Labour, members arrived in Torquay knowing expectations are high but that the party is still tainted by associations with eccentrics and extremism. Ukip believes its stance on immigration can win votes from all sides of the political spectrum.

Last year Ukip's anti-immigration campaign focused on the impact of transitional controls being lifted from January 2014. Ukip was strongly criticised for issuing campaign leaflets saying 29 million Bulgarians and Romanians would have the right to live, work and draw benefits in the UK from the start of the year. But, after two months, early indications are that the mass influx some predicted has not materialised – David Cameron recently said immigration levels from Bulgaria and Romania were ""reasonable"" – and in his speech Farage instead raised a fresh immigration concern.

""It isn't directly Romania and Bulgaria I'm necessarily concerned about. What I'm really concerned about is the fact in the eurozone, in the Mediterranean there is no sign or prospect of any significant recovery at all,"" he said.

""If the eurozone goes as badly over the next few years as I still believe that it will, we face the prospect of the largest migratory wave that has ever come to this country and we have three political parties who are not prepared to do anything about it.""

Farage also said that, if Ukip did well in 2014, they should be able to use that as a platform to win some seats in the general election. Asked if he would resign as leader if failed to get a Ukip MP elected, he replied: ""Good lord, yes. I will be out the door before you can say Jack Robinson.""

He faced a barrage of hostile questions at a press conference about the party's decision to appoint Neil Hamilton, the disgraced cash-for-questions former Tory minister, as Ukip's campaign manager for the 2014 election. Farage insisted that Hamilton was just a ""backroom boy"", but this was disputed by Hamilton himself who told the BBC's Newsnight that he saw himself as ""front-of-house"".

In response to questions about Hamilton's role with the party, Farage said: ""There are things that went wrong in his career. We all have things in our life that have gone wrong."" It was in the past, he insisted.

But Hamilton himself showed no contrition himself when he used his speech to attack the Westminster political class.

He attacked ""the deracinated political elite of parasites, the bureaucrats, the Eurocrats, the quangocrats, the expenses-fiddlers, the assorted chancers, living it up at taxpayers' expense"". It was Ukip's historic role ""to sweep them all away"", he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Zelenskiy posted a video on Saturday showing him meeting Sunak in the capital. “During today’s meeting, we discussed the most important issues both for our countries and for global security,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Following in the footsteps of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, Sunak has pledged that UK support for Ukraine in the fight against Russia will remain steadfast.

“In years to come, we’ll tell our grandchildren of your story, how proud and sovereign people stood up in the face of an appalling onslaught, how you fought, how you sacrificed, how you prevailed,” Sunak said at a joint press conference.

Britain knows what it means to fight for freedom.



We are with you all the way @ZelenskyyUa 🇺🇦🇬🇧



Британія знає, що означає боротися за свободу.



Ми з вами до кінця @ZelenskyyUa 🇺🇦🇬🇧 pic.twitter.com/HsL8s4Ibqa — Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) November 19, 2022

In response, Zelenskiy praised a “meaningful and useful visit for both our countries”, during which the two leaders had discussed how to protect “European and Ukrainian energy security” and defence cooperation.

“With friends like you by our side, we are confident in our victory,” he added on Twitter.

Sunak, who has spoken to Zelenskiy on more than one occasion since entering Downing Street, used his appearance at the G20 this week to join with allies and other western leaders to condemn Vladimir Putin’s invasion.

Sunak’s arrival was accompanied by the announcement of a £50m package of defence aid comprising 125 anti-aircraft guns and technology to help Ukraine counter Iranian-supplied drones, including radars and anti-drone technology.

He laid flowers at a memorial for the war dead in Kyiv and lit a candle at a memorial for victims of the Holodomor famine, before meeting emergency personnel at a fire station.

Sunak said it was “deeply humbling” to be in Kyiv. “I am here today to say the UK and our allies will continue to stand with Ukraine, as it fights to end this barbarous war and deliver a just peace,” he said.

“While Ukraine’s armed forces succeed in pushing back Russian forces on the ground, civilians are being brutally bombarded from the air. We are today providing new air defence, including anti-aircraft guns, radar and anti-drone equipment, and stepping up humanitarian support for the cold, hard winter ahead.

“It is deeply humbling to be in Kyiv today and to have the opportunity to meet those who are doing so much, and paying so high a price.”

The visit comes as Kyiv and several other regions of Ukraine grapple with power shortages after relentless Russian attacks on critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, the head of Ukraine’s biggest private energy firm urged Ukrainians to consider leaving their country to help save energy.

Moscow, in an attempt to force Ukraine to negotiate a peace that is unacceptable to Kyiv, has sought to destroy the country’s energy system with a series of mass strikes on power and thermal infrastructures. No energy system has ever been subjected to such powerful airstrikes as to threaten such long periods of blackout.

As temperatures fall below freezing and the first snow of the season dusts the streets of Kyiv this week, people across Ukraine are starting to worry about how to heat their homes due to blackouts caused by the Russian bombardment while officials struggle to restore power nationwide.

In an interview with the BBC, Maxim Timchenko, chief executive of the energy firm DTEK, said Ukraine’s electricity system becomes less reliable with each Russian attack. He suggested that reducing electricity consumption was the key to keeping it running.

“If Ukrainians can find an alternative place to stay for another three or four months, it will be very helpful to the system,’’ he said, saying people should view leaving the country as a way of helping win the war against Russia.

“If you consume less, then hospitals with injured soldiers will have guaranteed power supply,” Timchenko added. “This is how it can be explained that by consuming less or leaving, they also contribute to other people.”

Zelenskiy said about 10 million people were without power, describing the electricity situation in more than a dozen regions as “very difficult”.

“The situation with power supplies is difficult in 17 regions and in the capital,” he said. “Things are very difficult in Kyiv region and the city of Kyiv, Odesa region and also Vinnytsia and Ternopil [areas in western Ukraine].”

On Saturday, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children had been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. The eastern Donetsk region was the most affected, with 423 children killed or injured, the office said.

Officials said the figures were “not final” as they were still verifying information from zones of active fighting, liberated areas and territory still occupied by Russian forces.

Ukraine’s military, meanwhile, said it was checking the authenticity of footage that Moscow has said proves that Kyiv executed several surrendering Russian soldiers in what they have described as a “war crime”.

Videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian servicemen apparently killed after having surrendered to Ukrainian troops.

“Before launching an investigation, there must be grounds for it,” Ukraine’s spokesperson for the general staff, Bogdan Senyk, told AFP. “We are currently establishing whether these videos are fake,” he said, adding that they had been handed over to “specialists”.

In the footage, the soldiers, who are giving themselves up, lie down on the ground in the debris-filled back yard of a house before the video abruptly cuts off as shots are heard.

More footage shows the bodies of around a dozen people surrounded by apparent bloodstains.

“We are aware of the videos and we are looking into them,” a UN spokesperson told AFP on Friday, calling for the perpetrators to be held to account.

The Russian Investigative Committee, which investigates major crimes, said it had opened a criminal case into the “execution of captured Russian servicemen”.

The incident was not “the first and not the only war crime” committed by Ukrainian forces, a Russian defence ministry statement said.

The Guardian,"Once more commonly heard in talk about baseball than politics, the backstop has become one of the most discussed and contentious elements of the Brexit negotiations. It is a simple basic principle, but no one is able to agree precisely how it will work.

What is the Brexit backstop?

Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device intended to ensure there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.

It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep commitments of the Good Friday agreement intact.

Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, and it was formalised in the legal text of the withdrawal agreement, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.

The DUP has objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.

Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU’s customs union permanently if the UK and EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.

What was added to May’s withdrawal agreement?

In January 2019, the “joint interpretative instrument” – a legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement – was given to Theresa May to try to help her to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, then presidents of the commission and council. This letter stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.

In addition, a unilateral statement from the UK set out the British position that, if the backstop was to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believed it would be able to exit the arrangement.

Additional language was added to the political declaration that emphasised the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and to flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it ‘reduces the risk’ of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.

Theresa May could still not get parliament to approve her deal.

What happens next?

As the prime minister began a make or break reshuffle in an attempt to shore up his increasingly beleaguered premiership, Hutton announced he was to stand down from the government for ""family reasons"". He will leave parliament at the next general election.

His decision is another blow to Brown, not least because Hutton is the fourth Blairite cabinet minister to stand down in four days.

His resignation follows those of Jacqui Smith, Hazel Blears and James Purnell.

Alan Johnson, tipped as the most likely successor to Brown should he resign as prime minister, is to be rewarded for his loyalty in recent days with the key post of home secretary, moving from health.

But in a blow to Ed Balls, the children's secretary and Brown's key ally, the weakened prime minister was expected to allow Alistair Darling to retain his post as chancellor.

The justice secretary, Jack Straw, was also expected to remain in place, while Yvette Cooper was tipped to be promoted from chief secretary to the Treasury.

Today, more backbenchers echoed Purnell's call for Brown to go amid suggestions that up to 100 Labour MPs were prepared to call for him to quit.

The first results from yesterday's local elections compounded the crisis surrounding Downing Street, with the party losing 23 seats and holding only 20.

Bristol fell into Liberal Democrat hands after Labour lost eight of the ten seats it was contesting in the city.

But after the resignation of Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, as the polls closed at 10pm yesterday, Brown was given a boost by other cabinet ministers. .

Johnson released a short statement to the Press Association, insisting: ""I continue to believe that Gordon Brown is the best man for the job.

""It is vital now, more than ever, that we unite for the sake of the party and the government.""

David Miliband, a close ally of Purnell's, indicated that he would not be resigning from the government. He is expected to remain as the foreign secretary.

Meanwhile, Darling – who endured speculation earlier this week that he was going to be removed from the Treasury – has yet to comment.

Last night, Purnell gave the prime minister only moments notice of his departure as work and pensions secretary, which was announced in an open letter published in the media.

The leading Blairite plunged the government deeper into crisis by saying Brown's removal was needed to give Labour ""a fighting chance"" of victory at the general election.

""I now believe that your continued leadership makes a Conservative victory more, not less, likely,"" he wrote.

""We need to show that we are prepared to fight to be a credible government and have the courage to offer an alternative future.

""I am therefore calling on you to stand aside to give our party a fighting chance of winning. As such, I am resigning from government.""

His move was welcomed by backbenchers including Siobhain McDonagh, who was sacked as a whip after calling for a leadership election last year, and the Nottingham North MP, Graham Allen.

Allen said he hoped Brown would ""take the honourable way out so that the party can progress with a leadership election"".

The Labour backbencher Paul Farrelly said Purnell's actions were ""courageous"".

""I'm not particularly close to him personally or politically, but I think what he's done is a courageous act, and reluctantly, and very sadly, his assessment is correct,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

The senior backbencher Barry Sheerman, the chairman of the schools select committee, called for a secret ballot of Labour MPs on Brown's future, which he predicted would result in a majority vote for the prime minister to go.

The Conservatives demanded an immediate general election, calling on Brown to go to Buckingham Palace today to ask for a dissolution of parliament.

David Cameron, the Tory leader, said the government was ""falling apart in front of our eyes"".

In a statement, Downing Street said Brown was ""disappointed"" by Purnell's decision but was giving his ""undivided attention"" to the big challenges facing the country.

Those defending the prime minister and criticising Purnell included the cabinet ministers Straw, John Hutton, Geoff Hoon, Shaun Woodward and Andy Burnham, as well as the Cabinet Office minister, Liam Byrne, the housing minister, Margaret Beckett, and a host of whips, junior ministers and backbenchers.

Cooper said Purnell had been guilty of a ""misjudgment"".

She said: ""I just profoundly disagree with James. I've known James a long time, for 20 years, and I just think he's made a misjudgment about this.

""I also think he doesn't speak for the cabinet, for the Labour party, for the ordinary members that I was out door-knocking with yesterday evening.

""I'm not going to pretend this isn't a difficult morning for us, but I think that Gordon Brown, all the work he's been doing on the economy, all the work to deal with the expenses problems, he's the right person to lead us through this.""

Douglas Alexander, the international development secretary, told BBC Radio 4: ""I believe Gordon Brown is the right person to lead the party.

""At the moment, the country would not look favourable on a party that turned in on itself ... my interest is what ultimately is the right thing for the country.

""I do not believe the best interests of the party are served if Gordon Brown is removed as leader.""

But many of the supportive emails issued were almost identically worded, fuelling suspicions that they were part of a Downing Street effort to bolster Brown's position.

However, other MPs were clearly outraged at the cabinet infighting at a time when grassroots activists were out campaigning for Labour in the elections.

The Morecambe and Lunesdale MP, Geraldine Smith, said: ""I am absolutely furious at the gross disloyalty of these people.

""Most Labour MPs in the parliamentary Labour party are still backing Gordon Brown, and there is a small bunch of malcontents who are out to do as much damage as possible. It is disgraceful.""

And the former deputy prime minister John Prescott used a message on the Labourhome blog to dismiss Purnell as ""not so much a Blairite as a careerite"".","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The answer appears to be both’  The Guardian,"Suella Braverman

The great debate used to centre on whether the former home secretary was just very dim or very vindictive. The answer to this conundrum now appears to be both. First, we had her enthusiastic support of the Rwanda policy. The idea of sending small boats refugees to a country that has been deemed unsafe by the United Nations. So far, no refugee has yet been deported to Rwanda. So that worked well. Then she acquired a barge that turned out to be riddled with legionella. So far, only a handful of people have been housed there. It turns out that Braverman is good at talking about new ways to be unpleasant to foreigners, but less so at turning it into a reality.

In the summer, she gave a speech to the totally unhinged New “Make Britain Better by Having More Babies” Conservatives (AKA the National Conservatism conference) which was a clear leadership marker. And only last month, she was declaring homelessness to be a lifestyle choice. For those who are bored with being warm and not being assaulted. Anyone for glamping? Braverman was far from done, though. She then did her best to stoke up hate before a pro-Palestinian march with an opinion piece in the Times and duly got exactly what she wanted. She was eventually sacked by Sunak. All the better to stir up division from the back benches.

To most normal people, SBF could be filed under shyster from the off. On the grounds that if something appears too good to be true then it probably is. But to the gullible, hipster elite he became the poster boy for cryptocurrencies – at one point in 2022, SBF was ranked the 41st richest American – by founding FTX, a crypto exchange in which countless idiots deposited billions. Imagine their surprise when they discovered their money was so crypto that it no longer existed, as the scheme collapsed into bankruptcy. FTX had been a not-so-complicated fraud after all. In November, SBF was convicted on seven counts of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. He’s due to be sentenced in March 2024. No doubt hoping to be sent to a crypto jail.

Vladimir Putin

Almost without fail, every year you get some expert declaring that the Russian president is terminally ill and has only months to live, and every year Putin defies his critics and comes up with new ways to inflict pain and misery on his own people, his enemies and the rest of the world. For much of the last two years, Putin has focused his energies on his illegal war in Ukraine. This year, he also managed to fall out with Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner group, the Russian mercenaries spearheading the fighting in Ukraine, who appeared to launch a coup attempt by ordering his tanks to converge on Moscow. In the event, the tanks stopped short of Moscow and it appeared that some sort of truce between Putin and Prigozhin had been brokered. Less than two months later, Prigozhin’s private jet exploded in suspicious circumstances.

Villainy in a nutshell There is nobody who can’t be sacrificed on a whim.

Dan Wootton and Laurence Fox

For ever linked as the GB News double act who were fired for making and laughing at on-air misogynist remarks about journalist Ava Evans. Fox was once a promising actor – it helps to be part of an acting dynasty – but has since crashed and burned. He now thinks being generally not very bright, unpleasant and a fanboy of Douglas Murray makes him an exceptionally interesting campaigner for free speech. Really, his friends – if he has any – should take him to one side and suggest a spell in rehab. There is life after Lewis. And not just as the leader of the far right, populist Reclaim party. A party too demented even for Nigel Farage.

Wootton was a showbiz hack on the News of the World and the Sun before joining the MailOnline and GB News. Albeit a hack who always thought his own career was far more newsworthy than any of the celebs he wrote about. Where Wootton goes from here is anyone’s guess. He’s believed to be lying low in Scotland, hoping against hope that someone might want him back somewhere. Their loss is our gain.

Michelle Mone

Remember the pandemic? That time of collective national trauma when everyone – with the obvious exception of anyone working inside No 10 – pulled together. Tried to do the right thing. For the collective good. Well, it turns out that we were all mugs. Because for the sharper mortals, the Covid years were primarily the perfect business opportunity. A chance for chancers to make a killing. Step forward Michelle Mone. Or Baroness Mone, as she has been titled since 2015 when she was admitted to the Lords for services to lingerie. Or something. In November, she suddenly remembered she had, in fact, had something to do with PPE Medpro, a company created at the start of the pandemic that had zero track record in making PPE. What Mone did have, however, was the gift of the gab and she had the contacts. So she started lobbying ministers for PPE Medpro to be included in the PPE contracts “VIP” lane – whoever would have guessed that a VIP lane would be abused? This, remember, was for a company that hadn’t even been incorporated, let alone manufactured any PPE. The company went on to win more than £200m in PPE contracts (and some of the PPE was allegedly defective) while Mone managed to squirrel away £29m into an Isle of Man account. The government is now suing PPE Medpro for £122m plus costs. It’s people like Mone who made Britain ­great.

Thérèse Coffey

Here’s a little-known fact that’s destined to be a pub quiz classic. Who did Liz Truss appoint as her deputy PM? Yup, for all of 49 days, the country was on a knife-edge with Coffey a heartbeat away from power. In Westminster, her incompetence is legendary. As a reward for being useless, Sunak made her his minister for the environment, food and rural affairs – until she resigned in November. During her tenure she seemed to have made it a matter of principle to do next to nothing. Take the farmers. Coffey went all the way to Birmingham to give a speech at the NFU conference in which she basically insulted her audience. Then barely took any questions because she wanted to catch a train back to London. They run every half hour. But her greatest legacy? The fact that water companies have carried on pumping sewage into rivers and seas in industrial quantities. Not that things have improved since she left. It’s hard to believe, but a top executive at Anglian Water is Karen Barclay, wife of Steve, the new secretary of state at Defra.

Liz Truss

A politician we hoped we’d seen the back of, Truss magically appeared at the Tory party conference in Manchester where she was treated as the unofficial messiah. Her fringe speech – guest of honour, one Nigel Farage who isn’t even a Conservative party member – was the hottest ticket of the conference. The queue started forming two hours before she was due to speak and loads of us – including me, who was officially banned – were locked out. You might have thought that Truss would have wanted to begin her speech with an apology for the mini budget of 2022 that left the country near bankrupt and mortgage holders having sleepless nights. Not at all. Truss doesn’t do contrite. Rather she doubled down. The reason she had failed was not because she had been wrong, but because she had not been Liz enough. She should have made even more unfunded tax cuts. Worryingly, she appeared to be entirely serious.

Dominic Cummings

Most of us hoped we had heard the last of Boris Johnson’s adviser in No 10 when he was sacked at the tail end of 2020. But Cummings resurfaced in autumn to give evidence to the Covid inquiry. His appearance was partly to explain why everyone he has ever met were “useless fuckpigs”, “morons” and “cunts” – but mostly to let the country know that Johnson was a dangerous narcissist who was unable to make up his mind about anything, was unable to perceive the gravity of the pandemic and would have let hundreds of thousands more people die had not Cummings intervened to personally run the country. Most of us had known Johnson was a liability for years – as must Cummings, as he had allowed Johnson to be his useful idiot throughout the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. However, only Dom chose to keep quiet about this and immediately joined his team when he became PM. So, save the “nation’s hero” label for a fuckpig dim enough to fall for it, Dom.

Jordan Henderson

The former Liverpool midfielder has not been at all happy with the reaction of UK fans since his move to the Saudi side Al-Ettifaq in the summer. During his appearances for England, Henderson has been booed. He has made his displeasure known, saying he deserves better after 12 successful years at Anfield – many of them as captain – and more than 70 appearances for the national team. The fans see it rather differently. They see a footballer – who had earned a reputation as a high-profile LGBTQ+ ally – near the end of his career who is looking for one more substantial payday and isn’t fussy about where that money comes from. Suffice to say that women’s and gay rights don’t feature too highly on the Saudi agenda. Henderson’s defence – such as it is – is that he will be using his place in Saudi to raise the profile of women and gay rights. Mmm. We’ll be the judge of that.

Villainy in a nutshell March 2022: Qatar’s human rights abuses are: “Shocking, disappointing and horrendous.” October 2023, speculating on the Saudi bid for the World Cup 2034: “It’s exciting times for them as a country and I think it will be a special tournament if they end up getting it.”

Elon Musk

How do you make a small fortune? If you’re Elon Musk, you start with a large one. Time was when Musk was just some weird billionaire whose weirdness we observed disinterestedly from afar. But over the last year, many of us have been forced to engage with him as he attempts to bulldoze himself into our consciousness. Most contact has been through X, the social media platform that has become immeasurably worse since he bought it a year ago for $43bn. Under the guise of free speech, X has become a haven of competing hates where the shoutiest people congregate. No wonder it has lost millions of users and millions of dollars in advertising revenue. Musk also recently prophesied the end of work at Rishi Sunak’s AI summit. Unhelpfully, he didn’t seem to have any interest on how the rest of the world would get by without it. That’s a problem way below his pay grade.

That man walking down Downing Street. It can’t be … Surely … ? It is. It’s Dave. Make that Lord Big Dave Cameron of Chipping Norton. Recently installed as foreign secretary by Sunak in a last desperate attempt to try to salvage something from the wreckage of his time as prime minister. For the past seven years, Cameron at least has had the grace to remain somewhat in the shadows. Sitting in his £25K shepherd’s hut bashing out a self-serving memoir. Cosying up to China and charging for meet and greets on the lucrative international Yesterday’s Politician circuit. Lobbying government hard on behalf of his old mucker, Lex Greensill. So blatantly that he got his knuckles rapped by the Commons. Just the life of an ordinary, jobbing millionaire grifter. But forget all that. Because Sunak reckoned there were no suitable Tory MPs worthy of being foreign secretary – he could be right – and dragged Lord Big Dave back into government. This is the man who brought austerity to the country during the coalition years. Want to know why no public services work properly now? Lord Big Dave can tell you. He starved them of cash. Then there was Brexit. Cameron accidentally taking the UK out of the EU by calling a referendum he hadn’t prepared for to settle the differences of the Tory right. The country still hasn’t recovered. And this is competence. Still, look forward to him trying to bring peace to the Middle East with a referendum.

As soon as Shaw saw the result the following morning, her heart sank. “I was in shock,” she remembers. “Even though I voted leave, I thought, ‘Oh no! This is terrible!’ Then all hell broke loose. The texts started flying. There was a massive fight on Facebook.”

Rosamund Shaw is a pseudonym. If she was identified, she says, it might inflame the bitter family row that has been raging since last June, and she still hasn’t told her remainer daughter the truth about how she voted. In the weeks after the referendum, she found herself feeling apologetic around EU migrants. “I feel I need to smile and talk to people who are waiting on me in pubs and cafes and say, ‘I’m really glad you’re here. I don’t want you to go.’”

A few months ago, Shaw was hospitalised after an accident. “That was the catalyst that brought me over strongly to remain,” she says. “Ninety per cent of the people who dealt with me were immigrants. I thought, what the hell are we doing? This is wrong on so many levels. We’ve opened Pandora’s box and that distresses me beyond measure.”

How does she feel now about her decision on 23 June?

“I feel horrified with myself that I was so gullible,” she says heavily. “I feel ashamed.”

Seventeen months after the referendum, the regretful leave voter is the dog that hasn’t barked. Since the result came through, remainers have anticipated a significant U-turn for many reasons: the protest voters who didn’t expect leave actually to win; the ones who felt misled by the promise of £350m a week for the NHS; the ones spooked by the plunging pound and, more recently, the faltering negotiations. Surely, they felt, enough voters would see the error of their ways to weaken the mandate for hard Brexit at the very least.

Humans do not instinctively enjoy changing their minds. Admitting that you were wrong is a destabilising experience

In fact, the figures have remained stubbornly static. In April, the British Election Study surveyed almost 28,000 voters and found that 11% of leave voters expressed regret – but so did 7% of remain voters. While opposition to Brexit is hardening among remainers – according to YouGov, the number who believed the referendum result should be honoured plummeted from 51% to 28% between June and October – movement from leave to remain is slow. In October, the proportion of voters who felt that Britain had made the wrong choice reached a new high of 47% versus 42% (the rest weren’t sure). But that’s not yet enough to change the political calculus. However the question is phrased, the level of regret remains consistent with that following the 2015 election. The people featured in this article are a minority.

“It’s not that nobody is changing their minds,” explains Joe Twyman, co-founder of YouGov. “Very few are, and when they are, they’re cancelling each other out, so the aggregate level change is very small.”

For experts in voter behaviour or cognitive science, however, this is unsurprising. Humans do not instinctively enjoy changing their minds. Admitting that you were wrong, especially when the original decision has huge ramifications, is a painful and destabilising experience that the brain tends to resist. Research into this kind of denial has given us concepts such as cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias.

“When you have a strong view about something, you’re likely to reject information that’s contrary to your view, reject the source of the information and rationalise the information,” says Jane Green, professor of political science at the University of Manchester and co-director of the British Election Study. “We select information that’s consistent with our views, because it’s more comfortable and reaffirming.” In fact, it’s physically pleasurable. Some recent studies of confirmation bias indicate that consuming information that supports our beliefs actually produces a dopamine rush.

In the case of the referendum, there are additional factors that make it even harder for people to change their minds. For one thing, the decision in the voting booth feels irrevocable. Someone who regretted, say, voting for the Liberal Democrats in 2010 could choose another party in 2015, but someone who feels bad about voting leave doesn’t (yet) have a second chance. This makes life difficult for pollsters. While they can ask voters how they would vote if there were a general election tomorrow, a question about a hypothetical second referendum is controversial. Brexit opponents, including Nick Clegg and Alastair Campbell, have argued that another referendum on the terms of the deal would be legitimate, but many voters see this as a devious attempt at a do-over.

When I went to the cafe, I felt very bad. There are Europeans working there and I hadn’t even thought about them

Then there is the tribalism, which is intense. The referendum formalised a deep cultural divide. “We know that party identification is in decline,” Green says. “It could be the case that leave or remain is a more important identity.” In many cases, the vote manifested beliefs that had been entrenched for decades. “The campaign mattered, but it revealed divisions with deep roots,” she adds. “When people have held a view for a long time, that’s harder to change in the short run.”

To admit that you now believe you were wrong requires unusual honesty and courage; publicly to admit it takes even more. I contacted dozens of leave voters who had expressed regret on public forums. Many didn’t reply. Some agreed to talk, and then got cold feet at the last moment. A few, fearful of stoking tensions with relatives and colleagues, or of attracting abuse from Brexiteers, would only be interviewed anonymously. Others wouldn’t risk even that. “I have too many related family and business issues to deal with around this subject,” one told me. “Any hint would damage me even more.”

In politics, like many other spheres, we tend to valorise certainty and stigmatise ambivalence. A politician who sticks to their guns (even if they’re rigid, incurious and dogmatic) will fare better than one who vacillates (even if they’re honest, open-minded and justifiably cautious). “This is why undecided voters drive us crazy,” writes Kathryn Schulz in Being Wrong: Adventures In The Margin Of Error. “They think hard about something that most of us don’t have to think about at all. What these voters represent, however, are possibilities the rest of us often foreclose: the ability to experience uncertainty about even hugely important beliefs – the ability to wonder, right up until the moment that the die is cast, if we might be wrong.” And, in some cases, the ability to admit, after the fact, that they made the wrong call.

Mark Olive is a 30-year-old serviceman who lives in the south of England. Before the referendum was announced, he had never thought much about the EU, so he tasked himself with reading as much information as he could from all sides. “I was just getting a negative feeling about the EU, like it didn’t serve the interests of our country,” he says. The main reason that he was undecided until referendum day was the tenor of the leave campaign. “When I saw Nigel Farage and his Breaking Point poster, I thought, actually, I don’t like any of the people who want to leave the EU.”

Nonetheless, he went for leave. “I went to sleep thinking that we weren’t going to leave and in the morning I was shocked. I remember when I went to the cafe on camp, I felt very bad straight away. There are Europeans working there and it occurred to me that I hadn’t even thought about them during the campaign. All these issues started popping up. I hadn’t thought about half of them.”

Many regretters report experiencing a visceral emotional jolt when they heard the result. “From the moment I watched the results revealed live on television that night and my vote for leave played a part, I didn’t feel joy,” says “JC”, a 49-year-old former NHS worker from Manchester. “I felt dread and fear over what would unfold for our country. Then it transpired that the leave campaign backtracked on the £350m NHS ad. I knew we’d been fed BS.”

Not enough time was given to learn all the facts. I didn’t know anywhere near enough to make such a monumental decision

People are more likely to change their minds when they’re presented with new information than when they’re asked to reassess what they already knew. For the regretters, it’s often not that key facts were unavailable at the time; rather that the complexity of the issue meant they were too easily overlooked, or the leave campaign misrepresented them, or the remain camp failed to make them unignorable. While most voters, having done their democratic duty, moved on, regretters continued to weigh the evidence.

Olive has done a lot of soul-searching. He did his research, yet still feels that he missed many important factors. The experience has made him more cynical about politicians (he has since switched from Conservative to Labour) and the media. “I think a lot about how the media shaped my views,” he says. “Would I have voted differently if I’d gone about it a different way? I definitely resent the way some of the campaigning was done. I think we as a nation were deliberately misled.”

Graeme Berry, a 48-year-old carer from Livingston, Scotland, came to the leave camp via the leftwing strain of Euroscepticism known as Lexit, persuaded that the EU was “a big-business dictatorship that prevented true socialism from being implemented”. “I had misgivings from the morning the result was declared,” he says. “The most enthusiastic leavers appeared to be on the right. I thought: what have I done?” Before the referendum, Berry had emailed the EU requesting clarification of the rules on certain issues. The reply, sufficiently thorough enough to demolish the arguments that he had believed, arrived a few days too late. “I feel that, compared with the Scottish referendum, not enough time was given for ordinary people to learn all the facts. To be honest, I didn’t know anywhere near enough to make such a monumental decision.”

Some leave voters U-turned months later, based on subsequent developments and revelations. John Chalmers, 60, runs a guest house in north Lincolnshire, a region that voted leave by a 2:1 margin. Although he was aware of the economic risk, he was swayed by his friends and neighbours, the rapid influx of eastern European migrants to Lincolnshire and the promise of more money for the NHS. He is now a staunch remainer. “I think we’re aware of a lot more now than we knew during the campaign,” he says. “What to do with this new information? Do we act on it or say no, sorry, the decision’s been made? I think we should act on it.”

I’m quite comfortable with making mistakes and changing my mind. I don’t lose too much sleep over it

Paul Hartley, a 37-year-old mechanical engineer from Lancaster, describes himself as centre-left and instinctively pro-EU, but was turned around at the last minute by his father, who argued in favour of sovereignty and taking back decision-making powers. “That resonated with me,” Hartley says. “I spent weeks convincing my partner to vote remain only to spend the last few days convincing her to vote leave!” (She didn’t.)

He felt regretful as soon as he saw how the victors were framing the result. “Every time I hear a politician talking about immigration and the will of the people, that is not what I voted for at all. The leave vote has been completely hijacked by the extreme right. I thought that common sense would prevail, but that hasn’t happened.” As for his father’s sovereignty argument: “That’s a bit of a red herring. We’ve always had the power to make decisions anyway.” Still, he is sanguine about his error. “I’m quite comfortable with making mistakes and changing my mind. I think that’s important. I wish I’d voted the other way but I don’t lose too much sleep over it.”

Meanwhile, David Towne (not his real name) has literally lost sleep over his decision. A thirtysomething “moderate Conservative” who works for a non-profit in London, he describes his guilt as a kind of psychological crisis. Despite being a longstanding Eurosceptic who preferred a European Free Trade Association-style agreement, he remained open-minded but was turned off by the remain campaign. “I reverted back to my gut feeling, because there was a lot of shit-throwing and smearing,” he says. “I don’t think the remainers I knew were looking to convert anyone to their cause. It was just: let’s denounce you all as Ukippers and racists. This caricature of the angry, immigrant-hating leaver doesn’t ring true for me at all.”

He was “shocked and panicked” by the result. “Nobody in London was happy about it, and it suddenly dawned on me that I’d voted against the interests of my city.” It was a dark time. “I was taking too much responsibility on myself. In retrospect, I’ve realised it’s disproportionate and others are far more responsible. I am just one tiny dot in the electorate. But I just felt totally fucked. I’d done something to harm my country, which I love.”

The gravity of the decision to switch from leave to remain means that regretters tend to take a hard line on Brexit. When I presented them with various scenarios, some chose a second referendum, but others wanted the process stopped in its tracks. “If I could wave a magic wand,” Olive says, “I wouldn’t want us to leave at all, because I honestly don’t think it would do anyone any good.” Towne agrees: “I’d love to call the whole thing off. It’s been head-in-hands awful, watching the lack of vision and Theresa May’s ridiculous culture war soundbites.”

Most people I spoke to felt that holding a referendum to decide policy, rather than to gauge public opinion, had been a disastrous decision in the first place. “They should have measured feelings so they could go back and negotiate,” Chalmers says. “A company doesn’t run that way. You’d need a quorum to make a decision like that.”

Hartley has been disturbed by the surge in aggressive behaviour towards people in Lancaster who aren’t white and British, including some friends from Lithuania. “It’s almost like it’s now OK to be racist. People aren’t afraid to show those feelings. Even if for some reason we don’t leave, I worry about the impact on the country.”

“For me, leaving the EU has cast a huge cloud of gloom and anxiety,” JC says. “The Tories put this mess in the hands of the British public, and for that I will never forgive them.”

Anyone who follows the Brexit debate via the news, Facebook or Twitter could be forgiven for thinking that both sides are inflamed with righteous passion. But Rosamund Shaw has encountered complacency and detachment among her leave-voting friends. “They won’t talk about it,” she says. “They have this Pollyanna attitude: it’ll be fine. I can’t decide if they’re being ostrich-like or if they believe it.”

Olive has also encountered a reluctance to discuss Brexit. “A lot of people who voted leave are very casual about it. They don’t think about it that much. The feeling I get is people have their minds made up, and they want to be left alone to move on to other things.”

For most Britons, Brexit is a phoney war that barely touches their lives. “From a personal point of view, things haven’t changed, so there’s no reason for them to change their minds,” YouGov’s Twyman says. “It’s like Vietnam during the Kennedy years. It’s this thing that you watch on TV but you think doesn’t affect you, and it won’t affect you until it’s your son getting the draft papers. I’ve been doing this job for 17 years and I’m never surprised by the lack of attention that most people pay to politics. We know that a lot of people voted to leave the EU so they wouldn’t have to discuss Brexit again, little knowing that we’re going to have to do nothing but that.”

People change their minds when something shakes them out of their resistance. Things will have to go badly wrong

Individually, regretters are powerless. In sufficient numbers, however, they could be extremely influential. Even when 64% of voters in YouGov’s latest poll think the negotiations are going badly, Brexiteers can shoot down criticisms by invoking “the will of the people”. But what happens to their mandate, and the perceived validity of a second referendum, if the will of the people shifts decisively and MPs begin to fear for their seats?

“The mainstream media is slanted towards leave,” Berry says. “There is no recognition of people changing their minds. I have been very active on social media to spread the truth about the EU and what we will lose. I have been accepted by the remain side. I have also made friends on the leave side, with those willing to listen. Many have changed their opinion, too.”

“It bothers me that remain politicians and public figures aren’t talking to regretters,” Towne says. “If you want to stop or dilute this thing, then you should be appealing to us. My friends and family who voted leave can all see it’s a shitshow, and we all wish we hadn’t voted for it. I’m talking about dozens of people. I think there are a lot of shy regretters who don’t show up in the polls. I think if the polls start to switch, then slowly but surely the discourse will change.”

Green says it would take a seismic event significantly to move the needle. She cites Britain’s ugly exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1992, which hammered the Conservatives’ reputation for economic competence. “People change their minds when something shakes them out of their resistance,” she says. “Symbolic events that are so politically salient that you have to adjust your opinion. I think with Brexit things will have to go badly wrong. Something that you can’t rationalise away.”

Twyman expects to see serious movement only when a final deal is presented to the public. “Seventy per cent of people believe that in theory we should leave the EU,” he says, citing a recent poll in which only 32% actively wanted to thwart Brexit. “But what if that’s 10 groups of 7% or 20 groups of 3.5%, each group with its own particular requirements? And what if the deal that’s struck appeals to only one of those groups? There’s huge potential for change.”

Until that happens, a straight leave/remain binary won’t reflect the more subtle changes unfolding beneath the surface. “I think people can see that it’s not going well, but is that enough for them to say they would have voted in a different direction?” Green says. “I don’t think it is just yet. People are more likely to say they don’t know than they are to switch sides. That’s the destination for a lot of people who have reservations.”

Far from being a dead zone of apathy, the category of Don’t Know – ranging from 10% to 15% in polls – may therefore contain some of Britain’s most thoughtful, self-questioning voters. Chalmers proposes that we think differently about the value of changing our minds and view regret as a virtue, rather than a vice.

“I don’t feel like you have to be weak,” he says briskly. “You can apologise, pick up the pieces and make yourself stronger out of it. If you’ve made a mistake, realise it, undo it and move on. Not everybody can do that.”

The House of Commons is the main lawmaking body for the United Kingdom (the other is the unelected House of Lords). It consists of 650 members, each of whom is elected by a geographical constituency of roughly equal population.

In each constituency, the candidate with the largest number of votes wins. There is no need to win 50% of the vote, and votes for other candidates are in effect lost. This is known as first-past-the-post voting.

The Commons also chooses the prime minister. By convention, the Queen invites the leader of the largest party to form a government. The prospective prime minister needs to have the support of the majority of MPs. This is possible if they lead a party with an overall majority or have the backing of other parties.

A majority technically requires 326 MPs (half of all seats plus one), but a small number of MPs – including the Speaker, his deputies and the members of Sinn Féin – don’t usually vote. This means a working majority can be achieved with just under 50% of seats.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

26 Oct 2023 18.03 CEST Summary Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day: Liz Truss has written to the prime minister to say she is “deeply disturbed” that China has been invited to next week’s AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. She said China views AI as “a means of state control and a tool for national security”. She is calling for the invitation be rescinded.

Rishi Sunak defended his decision to invite China but admitted that engaging with China on artificial intelligence may not be successful.

Artificial intelligence brings new dangers to society that must be addressed “head on”, the prime minister has warned. Rishi Sunak made the comments during his speech ahead of next week’s landmark global safety summit at Bletchley Park, where politicians and tech executives from around the world will discuss how the technology should be regulated.

Rishi Sunak said that the government would not “rush to regulate” AI. The prime minister also announced that the UK government was establishing the “world’s first” artificial intelligence safety institute.

A potential byelection in Peter Bone’s Wellingborough constituency is likely to be “challenging”, the deputy prime minister said. After MPs approved a six-week suspension against Bone for bullying and sexual misconduct against a staff member, a recall petition will be held, which will trigger a byelection if it is signed by 10% of voters in his Northamptonshire constituency.

Rishi Sunak said byelections are “always difficult for incumbent governments” , adding he was “confident” his government could lower taxes after inflation was “brought down”.

Rishi Sunak signalled he wa s “confident” his administration would be able to cut taxes before the next election. But the prime minister said it remained the “right economic policy” to focus on delivering his pledge of halving inflation by the end of the year

Boris Johnson’s pandemic-era chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, will give evidence to the Covid inquiry next week, alongside other senior officials from Number 10 during that period. The inquiry confirmed that Cummings will appear on 31 October.

The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been accused of apparent plagiarism in her new book about female economists. An examination by the Financial Times of the book, The Women Who Made Modern Economics, found more than 20 examples of passages from other sources that appear to be either lifted wholesale, or reworked with minor changes, without acknowledgment.

Chris Hallam, 48, and his mother, Christine, 76, former teachers from Buxton in Derbyshire, were arrested in September after Robert Largan, the MP for High Peak, accused them of harassing and stalking him. They are now on bail and are banned from going within 50 metres of him and three members of his staff and within 5 metres of his office. Chris Hallam stood for the Green party in the High Peak borough council elections in May and was beaten by one Labour party candidate and another from the Conservative party. He is also High Peak’s Green party campaign coordinator, and he claims he cannot carry out his duties because of the stringent bail conditions imposed after his arrest. The Hallams say their only crime was turning up to all of Largan’s constituency events after the MP blocked them on Facebook, and asking questions about local and national issues. Largan reported the Hallams to the police in September after sending them a “cease and desist” letter on 7 July, which informed them that “your persistent actions over the last three months, including but not limited to attending constituency surgeries around High Peak after being specifically asked not to attend in person, and disrupting the surgeries by your aggressive behaviour, are unacceptable.” The letter said the behaviour had continued “despite advice from Derbyshire police that you should not attend my surgeries in person”. Ordering them to stop “all such activities” immediately, Largan wrote: I believe your behaviour has caused harassment, alarm and distress to myself and my staff on a number of occasions. Warning them that he may contact the police if they ignored the letter, he said they could raise issues with him regarding constituency matters only by writing a letter or emailing him. Hallam admits that he and his mother ignored the letter and turned up to see Largan at a branch of Morrison’s supermarket in September. On arrival, he said, two police community support officers (PCSOs), as well as Morrison’s security guards, prevented them from speaking to the MP.

26 Oct 2023 16.50 CEST Parliament has been officially prorogued until 7 November for the start of the new parliamentary session and the king’s speech, which will set out the government’s future agenda, including legislative plans. Share Updated at 17.48 CEST

26 Oct 2023 16.47 CEST Rishi Sunak signalled he is “confident” his administration will be able to cut taxes before the next election. But the prime minister said it remained the “right economic policy” to focus on delivering his pledge of halving inflation by the end of the year, PA Media reports. The British leader included the commitment as one of his five promises to the electorate during a speech in January. Sunak, speaking after his artificial intelligence address on Thursday, said: As we bring inflation down, then is the time to look forward and of course I want to deliver a lower tax economy for the country. And I’m confident that we will, but first we have to make sure that inflation is brought down. There has been clamour from the right wing of his Conservative backbenches to introduce tax cuts before the nation goes to the polls to elect the next Westminster government. A host of Tory MPs, including the former business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, have signed-up to a pledge not to vote for chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement next month if it increases the overall tax burden on the UK. A general election is due to be held before January 2025, with speculation over when Sunak will decide to go to the country. Share Updated at 17.49 CEST

26 Oct 2023 15.42 CEST Summary Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day so far: Liz Truss has written to the prime minister to say she is “deeply disturbed” that China has been invited to next week’s AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. She said China views AI as “a means of state control and a tool for national security”. She is calling for the invitation be rescinded.

Rishi Sunak defended his decision to invite China but admitted that engaging with China on artificial intelligence may not be successful.

Artificial intelligence brings new dangers to society that must be addressed “head on”, the prime minister has said. Rishi Sunak made the comments during his speech before next week’s landmark global safety summit at Bletchley Park, where politicians and tech executives from around the world will discuss how the technology should be regulated.

Rishi Sunak said the government would not “rush to regulate” AI. The prime minister also announced that the UK government was establishing the “world’s first” artificial intelligence safety institute.

A potential byelection in Peter Bone’s Wellingborough constituency is likely to be “challenging”, the deputy prime minister said. After MPs approved a six-week suspension of Bone for bullying and sexual misconduct against a staff member, a recall petition will be held, which will trigger a byelection if it is signed by 10% of voters in his Northamptonshire constituency.

Rishi Sunak said byelections are “always difficult for incumbent governments” , adding he was “confident” his government could lower taxes after inflation was “brought down”.

UK government ministers are to hold an emergency committee meeting as work intensifies to secure “pauses” in the conflict between Israel and Hamas after a tank raid on Gaza. Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said he would chair a Cobra meeting with figures from the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office on Thursday morning.

Boris Johnson’s pandemic-era chief adviser Dominic Cummings will give evidence to the Covid inquiry next week, alongside other senior officials from Number 10 during that period. The inquiry confirmed that Cummings will appear on 31 October.

The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been accused of apparent plagiarism in her new book about female economists. An examination by the Financial Times of the book, The Women Who Made Modern Economics, found more than 20 examples of passages from other sources that appear to be either lifted wholesale, or reworked with minor changes, without acknowledgment.

26 Oct 2023 15.07 CEST Inviting China to AI summit a mistake, says Truss Liz Truss has written to the prime minister to say she is “deeply disturbed” that China has been invited to next week’s AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. She said China views AI as “a means of state control and a tool for national security”. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, she said: We should be working with our allies, not those seeking to subvert freedom and democracy. She is calling for the invitation be rescinded. China should not be invited to the UK's AI Summit at Bletchley Park.

26 Oct 2023 14.33 CEST Dan Milmo Rishi Sunak has announced the establishment of a UK AI safety institute but has declined to support a moratorium on advanced development of the technology. The prime minister said the institute would be a world first and would test new types of AI for a range of risks from generating misinformation to posing an existential threat. Announcing the move before next week’s global summit on AI safety at Bletchley Park, Sunak said the institute would “advance the world’s knowledge of AI safety”. in a speech at the Royal Society, an association of world-leading scientists, Sunak said: It will carefully examine, evaluate, and test new types of AI so that we understand what each new model is capable of. He said it would explore “all the risks, from social harms like bias and misinformation, through to the most extreme risks of all”. A prototype of the safety institute already exists in the UK’s frontier AI taskforce, which is scrutinising the safety of cutting-edge AI models and was established this year. However, Sunak said a pause in developing powerful models was not feasible. Asked after the speech if he would support a moratorium or ban on developing a highly capable form of AI known as artificial general intelligence, he said: I don’t think it’s practical or enforceable. As a matter of principle, the UK has rightly been an economy and society that has encouraged innovation for all the good that it can bring. And I think that is the right approach. The debate over AI safety reached a new peak in March when an open letter signed by thousands of prominent tech figures including Elon Musk called for an immediate pause in the creation of “giant” AIs for at least six months. It warned that AI labs were “locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control”. A separate statement signed by tech executives in May, and referenced by Sunak on Thursday, referred to treating the extinction risks from AI development on a par with nuclear weapons and pandemics.

26 Oct 2023 13.53 CEST Severin Carrell Humza Yousaf has asked one of Scotland’s senior legal officers to investigate complaints from the UK Covid inquiry that his government has failed to hand over WhatsApp messages and other social media discussions. The first minister was challenged about the allegations by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, during first minister’s questions on Thursday, after complaints earlier to the UK hearing by Jamie Dawson KC, a Scottish counsel to the inquiry. Ross accused the Scottish government of refusing to comply with the inquiry’s request, which would cover text, Telegram and Signal app messages, made earlier this year. Ross asked: Where are the messages; where have they gone and has the Scottish government deleted any requests? He said it emerged last year that the first minister and four other ministers did use WhatsApp to discuss government business. During heated exchanges with Yousaf, Ross added: It would be a shocking display of secrecy; it would potentially break the law. Yousaf retorted that unlike the UK government, his administration did not take decisions via WhatsApp. He insisted he, his ministers and his officials were aware of their legal duties to retain that information and that they were bound by a “do not destroy” policy. Even so he said he had asked the solicitor general, Ruth Charteris KC, to investigate the inquiry’s complaints earlier this morning. I can give an absolute assurance to those families listening, where we hold any relevant information that will be passed on. Ross’s line of attack follows the controversy which enveloped the former prime minister Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and the UK government over their alleged failure to disclose messages to the UK Covid inquiry. Aamer Anwar, the lead solicitor for the Scottish Covid Bereaved family group, said the disclosures at the UK hearing were “devastating”. He said: The families we represent deserve the truth. The Scottish Covid Bereaved find it inconceivable that the most senior figures in the Scottish government from former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, [deputy first minister] John Swinney, [finance secretary] Kate Forbes to the present first minister, Humza Yousaf, failed to retain their WhatsApp messages over the two-year period of the pandemic.
