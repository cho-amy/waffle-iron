After polls closed on Election Day, Donald Trump could have accepted that American voters had opted to replace him. He could have ignored the months of groundwork laid to claim that the election was stolen and admit that it wasn’t. But he did not. In the middle of the night, he told reporters and America that he’d won — and he spent the next two months in an unsuccessful effort to manifest that falsehood.

For a long time, he escaped significant accountability. He was impeached by the House in 2021 but Senate Republicans voted against convicting him following the trial. A civil suit brought in 2021 by police officers who were at the Capitol riot crept through the legal system and remains unresolved. The House select committee investigating his actions after the election cobbled together a detailed picture of how he’d tried to retain power — but then Republicans won the 2022 midterms and the committee quickly wrapped up.

Then, in August 2023, special counsel Jack Smith obtained a federal criminal indictment against Trump for his efforts to retain power. The stage was set for Trump to have to account for his actions; there were 15 months during which his response to the 2020 election could be adjudicated before the next presidential election in 2024.

But, again, the process moved slowly — and will now move more slowly still.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court announced that it would consider Trump’s primary delay tactic: an argument that he had broad immunity for his actions because of his position. It’s an argument that’s been rejected multiple times in various venues previously and one that most independent observers view as invalid. The Supreme Court will probably (though by no means certainly) agree. But, thanks to how this has unfolded, Trump’s 2020 actions will probably not be adjudicated by the time voters go to the polls in November — which may render the whole thing irrelevant.

Again, this story begins on Election Day in 2020. Trump fought his loss with every tool at his disposal but failed to remain in office. In July 2021, following a June 30 vote, the Democratic-led House initiated the select committee to probe the riot at the Capitol six months before — and, more broadly, Trump’s post-election actions. The month after the committee was formed, six police officers filed a civil suit against Trump.

The committee did its work and held its hearings. By November 2022, though, the writing was on the wall: Republicans were likely to retake the House majority and dissolve the investigation. After the midterms, the committee issued a final report, about a month after Trump announced that he would seek the presidency again in 2024.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department had already started building a case against Trump. In late 2021, investigators were already subpoenaing people tied to Trump’s effort. As the House committee’s work progressed, the Justice Department sought copies of its interview transcripts. When Trump announced that he was seeking the 2024 Republican nomination, Attorney General Merrick Garland transitioned the existing probe to special counsel Jack Smith, offering a layer of distance from the Biden administration.

In August, Smith obtained the indictment in D.C. In early October, Trump argued that the case should be dismissed because he had immunity for his actions as president. Smith, as you might expect, disagreed.

Trump had already tried this tack in the civil case, without success. But it was obvious from early on that Trump saw the 2024 election as a central element of his legal fight: if he could be elected president — or maybe even just run — he could derail the federal government’s efforts to hold him criminally liable. Injecting this idea that he had immunity was, if nothing else, a way to slow the legal process.

The judge overseeing the D.C. case, Tanya S. Chutkan, rejected Trump’s argument — coincidentally on the same day that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his immunity claim in the civil trial. It didn’t take long for Trump to appeal Chutkan’s decision to that same appeals court.

Smith asked the Supreme Court to intervene, as a means of resolving the immunity question over the short term. Chutkan issued a stay on the criminal case while the immunity argument was being considered, meaning that no trial could move forward in the interim. The Circuit Court agreed to move quickly. Three days before Christmas, the Supreme Court rejected the request to jump in.

Earlier this month, the Circuit Court ruled against Trump’s immunity claim. Trump appealed that decision to the Supreme Court on Feb. 12. Smith asked the court to decide quickly.

“The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy,” he wrote in a response to Trump’s claims. “A President’s alleged criminal scheme to overturn an election and thwart the peaceful transfer of power to his successor should be the last place to recognize a novel form of absolute immunity from federal criminal law.”

He did not need to mention that Trump was again hoping to gain power through a democratic election.

On Wednesday, the court agreed to consider the case. Trump needs to present a brief by March 19 and Smith to respond by April 8. Oral arguments are scheduled for the week of April 22.

So the question becomes: Then what?

After the Circuit Court rejected Trump’s immunity claim, Just Security published a detailed article explaining its expectations on time frames. If the court agreed to hear the case, Norm Eisen, Matthew Seligman and Joshua Kolb hypothesized, arguments were likely to be heard in late March with a decision in mid-April. But we know now that predicted timeline was optimistic: instead, the court won’t hear arguments until Just Security figured they’d have handed down a ruling. The court’s current session ends in late June, meaning that a decision on immunity would, at the very latest, land then or in early July.

Now we apply the other estimates from Just Security: that there are still three months of pretrial considerations to work through and then a probable three-month trial. That means that, assuming a late-June Supreme Court decision, pretrial activity would be gearing up as the Republican Party holds its nominating convention in July. The trial might begin in late September — finishing at the end of the year.

There is no prohibition — formal or otherwise — about trying a political candidate before an election. But Trump would be expected to make political hay of the circumstances, arguing that a trial would be a form of election interference. Perhaps the court would resist such arguments and perhaps the preparations for and the trial itself would move faster than three months each. But the odds are slim and getting slimmer that the question of Trump’s criminality in attempting to retain power will be settled before voters are asked whether to return that power to him.

If he loses in November, none of this matters. His trial will continue and his guilt determined. But if he wins? He becomes president and could attempt to pardon himself. Accountability evaporates.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

He refused to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for the death of Alexei Navalny, 47, a Kremlin critic who died suddenly on Feb. 16 in a Russian penal colony — instead likening himself to Navalny, arguing they were both political prisoners.

And in a Fox News town hall Tuesday evening, he praised Russia for being “a war machine.”

“They defeated Hitler,” Trump declared, apparently referring to the Soviet Union’s role in World War II.

Since he announced his first presidential campaign in 2015, Russia has followed Trump like an unshakable thunder cloud. The former president has repeatedly expressed a fascination with Russia, lavished praise on Putin and refused to stand up to the Russian president on a range of issues — from interfering in the 2016 presidential election to invading Ukraine almost exactly two years ago.

Trump’s reluctance to forcefully confront Russia and his regular adulation of Putin have long raised the question: With Trump, why do “all roads lead to Putin?” as then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) memorably asked in 2019 during a contentious Cabinet Room meeting.

His latest round of pro-Russian cheerleading raises the same question — but now against a dramatically changed backdrop. The Russia-Ukraine war is entering its third year, with no signs of abating. Putin critics are calling the death of Navalny — who had survived a previous Russian attempt to poison him — a murder. And under Trump’s leadership, the Republican Party has drifted in a remarkably isolationist direction on foreign policy, with House Republicans currently holding up much-needed aid to Ukraine.

“His buddy-buddy — whatever it happens to be — affection with Putin is dangerous — to our transatlantic alliance, to NATO, to our support of people fighting for democracy in Ukraine,” Pelosi said.

“The Navalny assassination is something that is so startling and so blatant, and to see the former president’s comment about it just continues us on the path of: What is his connection to Russia?” she added.

Both Russia experts and some Trump confidants say the answer is far more straightforward than some of the existing theories, including the theory that the Russians have damaging material — known as kompromat — on Trump and are using it to blackmail him.

Rather, they say, the former president simply likes dictators and strongmen like Putin.

“My explanation is he just likes these big guys who did what they wanted to do, and he wanted to be a big guy who does what he wants to do,” said John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser who has since become an outspoken Trump critic.

Bolton described a broad “pattern of behavior,” pointing to Trump’s friendliness and fascination with other authoritarian leaders, such as Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, Viktor Orban of Hungary and Xi Jinping of China.

Trump, Bolton added, “had difficulty with a lot of democratically elected foreign leaders, particularly women,” and would sometimes refer to Xi as “king” — “because he was so impressive, so much in charge of China,” he said.

Michael McFaul, ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, similarly said that Trump admires strongmen leaders, but added that the former president also seems to genuinely share a similar governing philosophy with some of these authoritarians.

“There is a kind of ideological affinity between them, and there’s a kind of transnational movement of these populist nationalists, and the things that Trump says and the things that Putin says are very similar,” McFaul said. “I don’t think it’s just Trump mimicking Putin. I think that’s their shared worldview, and there’s millions of people who have that view.”

A former senior adviser to Trump, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share a candid assessment, added that Trump was simply “envious of dictators.” This person added that “10 times a day, maybe,” he and other top advisers tried to explain to Trump that Putin was dangerous and a threat to U.S. interests, but Trump was taken by Putin’s “tough guy image.”

“Putin and the other ones just worked him,” this person said. “It’s a vanity thing with him. It’s a tough guy thing. As long as you’re playing to those weaknesses, he’s going to think a lot of you.”

The Trump campaign rejected the notion that the former president was soft in his dealings with Putin. The campaign pointed to recent comments from the Russian president in which he said he preferred President Biden to Trump, describing Biden as “more experienced,” “more predictable” and “an old-school politician.”

“Vladimir Putin recently endorsed Joe Biden for president because he knows Biden is weak and can easily be bullied, as evidenced by Putin’s years-long invasion of Ukraine,” Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “When President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of America’s adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United States would respond.”

Yet Trump and Putin’s relationship remains especially complicated. The U.S. intelligence community, a bipartisan Senate panel and a two-year investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III all found that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Russia’s efforts to interfere were “sweeping and systematic,” Mueller found.

But Trump has refused to acknowledge that reality, repeatedly dismissing it as the “Russia hoax” and a political “witch hunt” meant to hurt him. Some people close to him privately say that he cannot disentangle his personal animosity and feelings of persecution over the fallout from Russia’s election interference with his foreign policy stances toward the country.

“For him, the idea that Russia interfered on his behalf undercuts his great win,” said Fiona Hill, who served as senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council during the first two years of the Trump administration. “He was always saying, ‘No, no, I won. I had a great win.’ He also didn’t want to be humiliated on behalf of Putin.”

She added: “If Putin actually did say to him, ‘You know, Donald, we did steal the election for you,’ he’d just implode because it undercuts his idea of being a winner.”

Regardless of Trump’s motivations, his policies also have supporters. Justin Logan, director of defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, described the Biden administration’s stance toward Ukraine as amounting to “a forever war, in practice.”

“A lot of Republican voters are asking themselves, ‘Does the administration or does anybody have a plausible theory of victory here?’ and I think it’s very easy to answer that question in the negative,” Logan said. “We’re just going to keep spending until Russia is bled white, and I think that’s not a great plan from the point of view of the American taxpayer.”

Edward King, founder and president of Defense Priorities, a foreign policy think tank, praised Trump for “at the very least getting the attention of Europeans” when it comes to NATO.

“Absolutely I’m in favor of rethinking the U.S. role in NATO,” King said. “I’m skeptical of permanent alliances, because that offers all sorts of trouble in the form of entanglements and getting involved in conflicts because of our relationships with countries rather than a sober look at U.S. security interests.”

Yet Trump’s ties with and behavior toward Russia — dating back to his days as a New York developer, eager to expand his empire to Moscow — have long raised concerns from fellow world leaders, Democratic lawmakers, his own national security team and even, at times, some of his fellow Republicans.

In June 2016, Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., met at Trump Tower in New York with Russians promising dirt on his dad’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton — and Trump later personally dictated the misleading statement that his son initially put out about the meeting.

At a news conference the following month, Trump publicly called on Russia to hack Clinton’s emails, saying, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”

Once elected, Trump’s bromance with Putin continued. In May 2017, Trump shared highly classified information with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during an Oval Office meeting, prompting both current and former U.S. officials to warn that Trump’s revelations jeopardized a key source of intelligence on the Islamic State.

Trump also repeatedly threatened to upend the NATO alliance — long a Putin goal. And at a 2018 summit in Helsinki, Trump met privately with Putin for two hours, joined only by their interpreters, before appearing at a news conference and siding with the Russian president over his own intelligence agencies on the issue of Russia’s election interference.

The Helsinki summit was hardly an aberration; throughout his presidency, Trump regularly worked to conceal details of his meetings and conversations with Putin from his own senior advisers.

His behavior continued once he left office. In February 2022, for instance, as Putin commenced his invasion of Ukraine, Trump described Putin and his aggression as “genius” and “pretty savvy.”

Most recently, he seemed to invite Russia to invade NATO counties that fall short of targets for military spending, again criticizing allied nations for not sufficiently contributing to NATO’s shared defense.

Alexander S. Vindman, who served as director of European and Russian affairs for the National Security Council during Trump’s presidency, said he fears that Putin sees Trump’s recent comments and views them as an opportunity to further ramp up Russian hostility in Ukraine — and elsewhere.

“He is signaling what a future in a second Trump administration would be like, which is friendly to our enemies and hostile to our friends,” Vindman said. “From Russia’s perspective, that is an optimal scenario.”

It is unclear if Trump’s embrace of Russia and reluctance to help Ukraine is a winning issue politically. Polls consistently show that about one-third of Americans say the United States is doing too much to help Ukraine, while most say the United States is doing the right amount or not doing enough.

A February ABC News-Ipsos poll found Americans roughly split between whether they trusted Biden (33 percent) or Trump (36 percent) more to do a better job handling the war between Ukraine and Russia. An additional 28 percent said neither, and 4 percent said they trusted both equally.

And a Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that 56 percent of registered voters support sending more military aid to Ukraine for its efforts in the war against Russia. The same poll found 47 percent approved of the way Biden is handling the response to Russia’s invasion, higher than the 40 percent who approve of his overall job performance.

McFaul said Trump’s pro-Russian comments could reverberate with Ukrainian Americans, as well as other voters who have family still living in Eastern Europe.

“You won’t be surprised that they were outraged by those comments, and there are people from those countries that live in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin,” he said.

Dan Pfeiffer, a former Obama senior adviser, said that while “a lot of Trump’s palling around with Putin is baked in the cake,” it also provides Democrats with a real opportunity heading into the presidential election.

“Trump is running as a strong man, and it is essential when you’re running against a would-be strongman to reveal their weakness, and this month, with his comments about Putin, is a great opportunity to do that,” Pfeiffer said.

Already, the Biden campaign has seized on Trump’s recent remarks. A minute-long ad airing in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin features Trump’s comments encouraging Russia “to do whatever the hell they want,” before a narrator intones: “No president has ever said anything like it. It’s shameful. It’s weak. It’s dangerous. It’s un-American.”

And after Trump’s comments during the Fox News town hall, where he again did not forcefully defend the NATO alliance, the Biden campaign blasted out a statement criticizing him for “empowering Putin.”

“Trump is a weak leader — someone who doesn’t understand the power of democracy here at home or across the globe,” the statement read.

One aspect of Trump’s stance on Russia has remained remarkably consistent: Its ability to alarm U.S. allies.

Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Trump and Russia was what everyone was talking about at the recent Munich Security Conference, during which news of Navalny’s death emerged.

“It’s all anybody ever asks: ‘Is he coming back, and what does it mean?’” Hill said, repeating the queries she fielded about Trump in Munich. “They just keep asking the same question, and they keep getting the same answer: ‘Yeah, he could come back, and it means you need to get your act together.’”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Now his lawyers say bond is a struggle.  The Washington Post,"Two weeks ago, a New York judge ordered Donald Trump to pay a huge penalty of $355 million plus interest — a grand total of more than $450 million — after finding him liable for fraudulently inflating his wealth. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight But now that it’s time to produce such an amount, Trump’s legal team is undercutting both his and their own claims about his ability to do so.

In a filing Wednesday, Trump’s lawyers asked for a delay and offered to post a bond of just $100 million rather than the full amount. They called the full amount a “facially absurd” judgment and added that its terms preventing him from obtaining loans “make it impossible to secure and post a complete bond.”

Posting cash or a bond in the full amount is required within 30 days of a judgment to avoid the penalties being enforced while Trump appeals, experts have told The Washington Post.

An appeals judge ruled later Wednesday that Trump will still need to post the full amount but that he can obtain loans; an appeals panel is expected to review the case and issue its own decision March 18.

Before that, Trump’s team also said posting the full amount would “likely” require selling property in ways that would irreparably damage him financially.

“In the absence of a stay on the terms herein outlined, properties would likely need to be sold to raise capital under exigent circumstances,” their filing says, “and there would be no way to recover any property sold following a successful appeal and no means to recover the resulting financial losses from the Attorney General.”

Trump lawyer Christopher Kise added during a hearing Wednesday, “No one, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Donald Trump, has 500 million laying around.” (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

But in the very same legal proceedings less than a year ago, Trump indicated he had something close to that amount of cash at his disposal.

In an April 2023 deposition, Trump volunteered that he had “substantially in excess of 400 million in cash.”

“Developers usually don’t have cash. They have assets, not cash,” Trump said. “We have, I believe, 400 plus and going up very substantially every month.”

Trump added later that, despite the legal fees he was facing, “I have over 400 — fairly substantially over $400 million in cash. That’s just cash. That’s just cash.”

It’s not clear that Trump’s legal team is saying that he doesn’t actually have the cash, as much as that producing a bond in the full amount is impractical.

It’s also possible that Trump’s cash flow has declined in the intervening months. But he claimed it was increasing significantly as of April 2023.

The Trump legal team’s claims are also at odds with what one of its own members said last week, after the judgment.

Appearing on Fox News, Trump lawyer Alina Habba noted that a bond including the full amount would have to be posted and added that “we will be prepared to do that.”

“Unfortunately, they picked the wrong guy to pick on, in my opinion, because he’s strong, he’s resilient, and he happens to have a lot of cash,” Habba added.

In an appearance on Newsmax, Habba was a little less convincing on that front. Asked if Trump had “that kind of money,” Habba interjected, “Yes.” But when the host finished the question with the clause “sitting around,” Habba offered a more equivocal answer.

“I mean he does — of course he has money,” Habba said. “I mean, he’s a billionaire.”

Trump’s ability to post the full amount has been the subject of plenty of speculation, given that his inflation of his wealth was well established even before New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) brought her lawsuit in 2022.

Over the weekend, The Post’s Jonathan O’Connell, Shayna Jacobs and Josh Dawsey walked through the cash crunch that posting the full amount could cause Trump and the avenues he might have for producing a bond. Trump faces a similar situation over an $83.3 million judgment against him in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

His 2015 speech announcing his presidential candidacy came out of the gates with claims about criminals and rapists crossing into the United States; it only got more demagogic from there.

Even with that baseline, though, one of Trump’s recent warnings was remarkable.

“Everybody I speak to says how horrible it is,” he said during an event at the border on Thursday. “Nobody [can] explain to me how allowing millions of people from places unknown, from countries unknown, who don’t speak languages — we have languages coming into our country, we have nobody that even speaks those languages. They are truly foreign languages. Nobody speaks them.”

Sigh. Okay.

Before we get into this, let’s stipulate that this assertion falls into that blurry area where so much of Trump’s rhetoric sits. He and his supporters laugh at this sort of thing as just being hyperbole. Trump’s being Trump! He pushes boundaries! So on and so forth! But some people won’t understand any overstatement that’s intended. Some people will hear, “The foreigners who are coming are really foreign.”

Advertisement

Trump, as always, is hoping to appeal to both of those groups.

We should also stipulate that this doesn’t make any sense from a logical standpoint: It cannot be the case both that someone speaks a language and that no one speaks that language. And we’ll stipulate that applying the sobering effects of reality to Trump’s hopped-up rhetoric is also part of his point, to make the media look like joyless cretins who overanalyze things. Again: stipulated.

But, as is also often the case, there is an interesting lesson to be derived from Trump’s lackadaisical consideration of the world. In this case: What particularly unusual languages might be arriving in the United States by way of new immigrants?

The CIA, for all of its controversial and dubious elements, maintains various databases of information about foreign countries. One of those is an overview of the spoken languages in more than 220 places around the globe.

Advertisement

We learn that in Canada, for example, most people speak English, one of the country’s two official languages. About 3 in 10 speak French, the other official language — meaning that at least 16 percent of the country speaks both. But there are other common languages, too: Chinese (4 percent), Spanish (3 percent), Punjabi (3 percent), Arabic (2 percent), Tagalog (2 percent) and Italian (2 percent).

Canada has a higher percentage of English speakers than the United States has of people who speak only the language, according to the CIA. The CIA was unable to break out the less-common languages spoken in the United States, simply offering that about 7 percent of the population speaks something other than English or Spanish. This is undoubtedly because the CIA is prohibited from spying on Americans. (This is a joke, and not a joke-that’s-actually-trying-to-make-a-political-statement in the Trumpian manner.)

This breakdown of languages by country means that a lot of obscure languages are identified. I did not know that about 2 percent of residents of Tokelau spoke Kiribati or that 1.4 percent of people in Timor-Leste spoke Naueti. Perhaps you did.

It is certainly possible that speakers of one of these less common languages might have come to the border with Mexico to seek entry to the United States. Mexico’s language mix is identified by the CIA as including “various Mayan, Nahuatl, and other regional languages.” But it is also true that fewer people speak less frequently spoken languages. Therefore, those people are less likely to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.

If they did so, though, there seem to be good odds that someone within the federal government (much less the broader population) would be able to understand what they’re saying.

The State Department has a division of translators who, “assisted by a corps of vetted contractors, offer their services in some 140 language combinations.” You can email them for help translating! Perhaps the Border Patrol is already familiar with this service.

The CIA, meanwhile, has an incentive program to encourage people who speak particular languages to work with them. If you speak Baluchi (spoken in Oman) or Ewe (Togo and Ghana) or Lingala (both Democratic Republic of Congo and Republic of Congo), ping your local CIA recruiter. There’s cash in it for you.

Speaking of Congo, Trump has recently more than once suggested that Congolese migrants have been encountered at the border.

“They interviewed some people last night,” he told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in an interview last month. “‘Where are you from?’ ‘Congo.’ ‘Where did you live?’ ‘Prison.’”

He’d told the same anecdote a few days prior in Michigan, so the “last night” part of that is obviously wrong. There’s also been no such interview that’s aired on cable news in recent weeks, it seems, just Trump telling this story — this story that very conveniently comports with Trump’s past rhetoric about criminality and people coming to the United States from Africa.

But perhaps it’s true. Maybe some Congolese immigrants came to the border and maybe they only spoke Lingala.

If that’s the case, though, good news: Someone was able to translate their admissions about their point of origin. Perhaps, given that he’s the only person who seems to be familiar with their story, this expert in the language is none other than Trump himself.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

(Video: TWP)

One man walked along a road, looked out beyond the tall shrubbery and later said the country needs a “new, efficient and fair process for the government to consider asylum claims.” Three hundred miles away, another man walked on a dirt path surrounded by razor wire and later said a “vicious violation to our country” was already underway.

What was on display Thursday, when President Biden and Donald Trump flew to separate parts of the U.S. southern border, was the potency of the immigration issue heading into the November election.

Also on display was the first real split-screen moment, a chance for American voters to directly compare the two very different policies, arguments and styles of the leading presidential candidates.

Scene 1: The arrivals

Biden arrived in Brownsville, Tex., and met with federal Border Patrol agents, and local law enforcement officials. He wore a baseball hat, a buttoned suit jacket and an open collared shirt as he walked along a portion of the border and officials pointed to where people have crossed into the country.

Danger or urgency around the situation at the border was not immediately present in the Biden scene.

Trump’s visit to a different city along the U.S.-Mexico border was the opposite.

The former president, in a blue suit and long red tie, met with Border Patrol officials and members of the Texas National Guard, who showed him that part of the border. At one point Trump walked by what looked like a wall of razor wire and a parade of military vehicles.

Scene 2: The briefings

Television cameras captured Biden speaking with officials inside the Border Patrol station in Brownsville. The room was decorated with American flags, and on one wall was a sign that read, in part: “Sworn by Oath.”

One person who briefed Biden spoke about the challenges of “handling the surge of families, of minors, of adults coming into the United States.” “Smugglers,” this person said, “are taking advantage of these vulnerable populations and individuals that are coming across.” There was also talk about the need for more technology and manpower to help detect weapons and drugs at the border. Another person told Biden about how they “tried to be very creative” to handle the overwhelming number of asylum requests that have been filed.

Trump, for his part, got a very different briefing in Eagle Pass.

Share this article Share

Inside a large white tent, Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Tex.) pointed to a photograph and told Trump, “Joe Biden entices them, if not forces them, to come right here.” One person in green military fatigues who briefed Trump inside the tent could be heard talking about the dangers posed by migrants, despite crime data showing that the threat is relatively low.

Thousands of people are “paroled into the country,” this person said, and they “go to Georgia and kill a nursing student” or “go to New York and beat up cops on the street,” or “they go to Louisiana and rape a 14-year-old girl.”

Scene 3: The speeches

Inside the room in Brownsville, Biden focused on the people working hard at the border, and the ones in Washington who he said were making it hard to work at the border.

Biden praised the work of Border Patrol agents, as well as immigration enforcement and asylum officers. “They’re all doing incredible work under really tough conditions,” Biden said. Then he said the solution to this problem is legislation that was being stalled by House Republicans. The bipartisan border deal that Biden referenced included desperately needed funding, he argued. “It’s the toughest set of border security reforms we’ve ever seen in this country,” Biden said. He added, “With this deal, we could hire 1,500 additional border security agents” and additional officers “between ports of entry.”

In Eagle Pass, Trump stood outside, with the heavily protected Rio Grande at his back, and said the country was in danger from the people on the other side of all that equipment. “They’re coming from jails, and they’re coming from prisons, and they’re coming from mental institutions,” Trump said falsely. “And they’re coming from insane asylums, and they’re terrorists. They’re being let into our country.”

Trump also tried to other the people crossing into the country as different from anything inside America, saying, “We have languages coming into our country. We have nobody that even speaks those languages.”

The comments were reminiscent of the racist attack he used against Mexicans when he launched his presidential campaign in 2015. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said at the time. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.”

Scene 4: Trading barbs

Biden eventually turned his attention directly to Trump. When he did, Biden invited him to “stop playing politics” with the border issue and urged him to tell congressional lawmakers to pass the bipartisan legislation. House Republicans opposed the bill after Trump publicly called for them to do so.

“So instead of playing politics with the issue, why don’t we just get together and get it done?” Biden said. “Let’s remember who the heck we work for. We work for the American people, not the Democratic Party, the Republican Party. We work for the American people,” he said, ending on the kind of nonpartisan message that he ran on when he sought the presidency in 2020.

Trump, on the hand, invoked Biden’s name only to brand it as part of the problem.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Justices from across the ideological spectrum warned of troubling political ramifications if they do not reverse a ruling from Colorado’s top court that ordered Trump off the ballot after finding that he engaged in insurrection around the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.

The court was considering the unprecedented and consequential question of whether a state court can enforce a rarely invoked, post-Civil War provision of the Constitution to disqualify Trump from returning to the White House.

During more than two hours of argument, the justices asked questions that suggested their often divided bench could reach a unanimous or near-unanimous decision to reject the challenge to Trump’s eligibility brought by six Colorado voters. Not since the court’s 2000 ruling in Bush v. Gore, which focused on ballot-counting and sealed the election for President George W. Bush, has the Supreme Court been thrust into such a pivotal role in a presidential election.

Liberal Justice Elena Kagan repeatedly questioned whether one state should be allowed to decide whether a presidential candidate is disqualified. “Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens but for the rest of the nation?” she asked, adding, “That seems quite extraordinary, doesn’t it?”

Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed, adding that “it just doesn’t seem like a state call.”

Trump is quickly closing in on the GOP nomination, and several justices suggested that a state court ruling initiated by voters in one state to bar him from federal office would throw the presidential race into extreme disarray.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. predicted that a number of other states would quickly try to disqualify the leading Democratic candidate if the justices allowed the Colorado decision to stand. He called the prospect of a handful of states deciding the presidential election a “pretty daunting consequence.”

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh worried about disenfranchising voters if the court removed Trump from the ballot. “What about the idea that we should think about democracy, think about the right of the people to elect candidates of their choice, of letting the people decide?” he asked.

In response, attorney Jason Murray, representing the Colorado voters, said, “The reason we’re here is that President Trump tried to disenfranchise 80 million Americans who voted against him, and the Constitution doesn’t require that he be given another chance.”

Derek Muller, a University of Notre Dame law professor who has been closely following the case, said Thursday’s arguments showed both liberals and conservatives on the court are “uncomfortable with the notion that it was going to be the decider here.”

“The court does not want to be in the business of cleaning up ballot access disputes for presidential candidates in perpetuity,” Muller said.

Unlike the divided ruling in Bush v. Gore, which polarized the nation, Muller said a unanimous or close to unanimous decision might be more widely accepted by the public.

“Maybe it’ll be more palatable to people to say, ‘Listen, we really expect the political process to solve this, rather than expecting litigation to answer the question.’”

The Supreme Court fast-tracked the case and could announce a decision at any time. Its opinion is expected to resolve the issue of Trump’s eligibility in other states where people have brought similar challenges.

Colorado’s top court put its December ruling on hold while the litigation continues. Trump’s name will appear on the state’s already printed March 5 primary ballot.

The legal questions at issue involve Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits anyone who previously pledged to support the Constitution as “an officer of the United States” from returning to office if they betrayed their oath by engaging in insurrection.

The challenge to Trump’s candidacy was brought by six Colorado voters — four Republicans and two independents. After a five-day trial, a lower court judge in November concluded that Trump engaged in insurrection when he summoned his supporters to Washington and encouraged an angry crowd to disrupt Congress’s certification of President Biden’s 2020 victory. But the judge also found that Section 3 did not apply to the presidency.

A divided Colorado Supreme Court disagreed and barred Trump from the ballot, prompting his appeal to the Supreme Court. Maine’s secretary of state reached the same conclusion, but her decision is also on hold.

Much of the discussion Thursday centered on differing interpretations of the text and history of the 14th Amendment provision, also known as the disqualification clause, which was initially intended to stop former Confederates from returning to power after the Civil War.

Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas and liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson — who have clashed on the most divisive issues before the court — both expressed deep skepticism of the Colorado voters’ view of the scope of the 14th Amendment. They agreed with Roberts’s assessment that the post-Civil War amendment was aimed at limiting the power of the states.

And yet, Roberts said, the Colorado voters seeking to remove Trump from the ballot appear to be trying to use the same amendment to say states have the power to prevent candidates from running for nationwide office.

“That seems to be a position that is at war with the whole thrust of the 14th Amendment and very ahistorical,” Roberts said.

The text of Section 3 does not specify who is supposed to enforce the clause or when it should be invoked.

If the court allows Trump to remain on the ballot and he wins, the questions about whether he is eligible to serve as president could come roaring back, warned Murray, the attorney for the Colorado voters.

“I think it could come back with a vengeance because ultimately members of Congress may have to make the determination — after a presidential election if President Trump wins — about whether or not he’s disqualified from office and whether to count votes cast for him under the Electoral Count Reform Act,” Murray said.

A majority of justices seemed ready to embrace the argument of Trump’s attorney, Jonathan Mitchell, who said enforcement of the disqualification clause is up to Congress, not state courts or officials. In addition, Mitchell said Section 3 does not apply to Trump because the president is not an “officer of the United States,” which is one of the terms the section uses when discussing potential insurrectionists.

Jackson seemed to share his doubts about whether Section 3 applies to former presidents because it is not one of the government positions specifically listed in the text.

“You have a list and president is not on it,” she emphasized.

Kagan, however, pressed Mitchell about why the framers would have left out the highest office in the land. What reason would they have had, she asked, for saying an insurrectionist cannot hold the “whole panoply of offices in the United States, but we’re perfectly fine with that insurrectionist being president?”

Mitchell acknowledged that it “does seem odd that President Trump would fall through the cracks,” but said the text represents a compromise. He insisted “officer” means an appointed official, not the elected president.

When it was his turn at the lectern, Murray, the voters’ lead attorney, urged the justices not to create a “special exemption” from the disqualification clause for Trump.

There were reminders throughout the argument about how much the nation’s political and civic landscape has changed in recent years with increasingly frequent impeachment proceedings in Congress and unprecedented efforts to subvert the 2020 election results.

Murray noted that Section 3 has rarely been invoked in modern times: “There’s a reason Section 3 has been dormant for 150 years, and it’s because we haven’t seen anything like January 6th since Reconstruction.”

Alito said in response that the past could not predict the future, noting that there were no impeachments of presidents for more than 100 years and “in fairly short order over the last couple of decades, we’ve had three.”

The justices, however, did not spend much time focused on the question of whether Trump engaged in insurrection — a topic that has deeply divided Democrats and Republicans.

The primary mention of that issue came when Jackson asked Trump’s lawyer why the violent attempt to stop Congress’s certification of the electoral vote count on Jan. 6 did not amount to an insurrection.

Mitchell answered by characterizing the attack as a “riot” and said there had not been an “organized, concerted effort to overthrow the government.”

“The events were shameful, criminal, violent, all of those things, but it did not qualify as insurrection,” Mitchell said.

Trump did not attend Thursday’s argument, though he has shown up in court recently for other legal cases he is involved in. But he said he followed the hearing from Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home and private club. In remarks to reporters afterward, Trump defended his words and the actions of his supporters on Jan. 6.

In the three years since the attack on the Capitol, the former president has steadily escalated his glorification of the rioters, including some who have been convicted of assaulting police. He also has spread misinformation and conspiracy theories about the deadly violence.

Trump on Thursday repeated the falsehood that “there were no guns” on Jan. 6 even though court records, trial testimony and accounts from police officers and rioters have shown that multiple people brought firearms to the area between the White House and the Capitol, and six men were arrested that day for having guns in the vicinity of the Capitol.

He also attempted to shift blame for the assault to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “I think it was an insurrection caused by Nancy Pelosi,” he said. Trump has in the past falsely accused Pelosi of being responsible for Capitol security and claimed he offered National Guard troops, an assertion contradicted by other officials.

There were reminders in court Thursday that the former president’s eligibility to return to office is not the only question before the justices that could affect Trump’s political future.

When Kavanaugh tried to get his lawyer to acknowledge that a candidate could be disqualified from office if prosecuted and convicted of insurrection, Mitchell agreed. But, he added, his client is arguing he has presidential immunity and would not concede he could be prosecuted for his conduct around Jan. 6.

Trump is expected to ask the Supreme Court by Monday to reverse a ruling this week from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that said he is not protected by presidential immunity from being prosecuted for trying to block Biden’s 2020 victory.

The justices separately have said they will review the validity of a law that was used to charge hundreds of people in connection with the Jan. 6 riot and is also a key element of Trump’s four-count federal election obstruction case in Washington.

In a sign of the significance of the case before the high court on Thursday, the courtroom was filled with many guests of the justices, high-profile visitors and dozens of journalists. Among those in attendance was Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who helped lead impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago that the argument was “a beautiful thing to watch, in many respects.”

“I thought the presentation today was a very good one,” he said. “I think it was well received. I hope it was well received.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The announcement marks the beginning of the end of an era in American politics. McConnell has been a towering force over his decades in the Senate, enraging Democrats by using hardball tactics to reshape the federal judiciary and later serving as an occasional voice of rebuke to former president Donald Trump, whom he excoriated publicly for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Recently, McConnell has been the loudest voice in his party pushing for the United States to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia, and he has faced sharp criticism from some in his conference more closely aligned with Trump. He has also faced health issues in the past year after a fall, including an incident in which he froze during a news conference in the Capitol.

McConnell had already decided he was not going to run for leader again even before he fell and suffered a concussion at a fundraiser last year, according to two people familiar with his decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations. After the holidays, he let a small circle of aides and advisers know he was ready to announce his decision, they said, and was just looking for the right time to do so.

The announcement probably kicks off a nearly year-long jockeying process to replace McConnell, who has next to no relationship with Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee. That estrangement, worsened by Trump’s racist attacks against McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, had made McConnell’s hold over his conference slightly more tenuous.

McConnell announced his intention to leave his leadership position in an introspective speech on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying it had been a difficult time for his family after the loss of his wife’s younger sister and giving a rare acknowledgment of his advanced age.

“When you lose a loved one, particularly at a young age, there’s a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process,” McConnell said. “Perhaps it is God’s way of reminding you of your own life’s journey, to reprioritize the impact of the world that we will all inevitably leave behind. I turned 82 last week and the end of my contributions are closer than I’d prefer.”

McConnell recounted the beginning of his congressional career in 1984, at age 42, during the Reagan administration.

“If you would have told me 40 years later that I would stand before you as the longest-serving Senate leader in American history, frankly, I would have thought you’d lost your mind,” he said.

He suggested that he will finish out his term, which goes through 2026.

The Kentuckian has spent the past few months locked in a battle with some in his conference to send billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, which is fending off a Russian invasion. The more isolationist wing of the party — championed by Trump — opposes the aid, and McConnell has painted aiding the U.S. ally in existential terms, joining nearly two dozen Republicans in voting for it this month.

He said he was leaving the chamber with “total clarity and peace” about the role he played furthering his ideals, despite the party not being in step with him.

“I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time,” he said. “I have many faults. Misunderstanding politics is not one of them. That said, I believe more strongly than ever that America’s global leadership is essential to preserving the shining city on a hill that Ronald Reagan discussed.”

President Biden, who served alongside McConnell in the Senate for many years, said he was “sorry” to hear he was stepping aside. “I’ve trusted him and we have a great relationship,” Biden said. “We fight like hell. But he has never, never, never misrepresented anything.”

Senators said they were surprised by the announcement. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) shook McConnell’s hand after the speech, and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a longtime ally, embraced him. McConnell’s most emotional greeting came from Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.). McConnell wrapped her in a long hug, then grasped her hands as the two spoke quietly. When Collins gave impromptu remarks after McConnell’s speech, Sinema sat alone on the GOP side of the chamber and wiped away tears.

McConnell vowed to be the “Grim Reaper” if Democrats won back the White House in 2020 but earned the ire of those on the right by occasionally working with Democrats on shared priorities, including recent votes for a large infrastructure package and funding for U.S. allies. In earlier years, he enraged Democrats by blocking President Barack Obama from filling the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, and later quickly moved to fill the seat vacated by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020. The hardball tactics drew rebukes from some good governance experts, although McConnell has expressed a reverence for the institution of the Senate in other arenas — including for maintaining the long-standing filibuster rule that requires a supermajority to pass most legislation.

“McConnell has shown good judgment several times on Trump’s extreme positions,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 ranking Senate Democrat. “I hope that whoever succeeds him will [do the same] if Trump is still on the scene.”

McConnell’s decision also launches the campaign to replace him in the difficult job of keeping a conference together that spans abortion rights moderates such as Collins and staunch Trump acolytes such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).

The leading contenders to replace him include McConnell’s top deputy, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) and Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) — all of whom have endorsed Trump for reelection.

“I think … the gift that Mitch has given us is the runway to actually really contemplate it and have them audition,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said.

“He leaves really big shoes to fill,” Thune conceded, declining to say whether he will run to replace McConnell.

Another member of leadership demurred when asked whether he will eventually run for the leadership position.

“That election’s nine months away, and there’s a much more important election between now and then. And that’s the election we need to take the presidency and the Senate and the House, and that’s where my focus is,” said Barrasso, the third-highest-ranking Senate Republican. Cornyn said he’s “made no secret” of his intentions to run.

Scott Jennings, a GOP strategist and longtime McConnell ally, said he believes McConnell will continue to play an active role in the Senate even after he steps down and may want to be in leadership on the Appropriations Committee. “You’re going to see him free from the responsibilities of leadership,” he said.

McConnell’s legacy includes fighting fiercely against reining in the role of money in politics, as he worked to expand corporations’ and individuals’ ability to contribute vast sums to political candidates and causes. He even took a member of his conference, the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), to court over the issue after the senator passed bipartisan legislation pushing campaign finance limits.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) choked back tears after McConnell’s speech. “There’s not been a better leader who has been more focused on the integrity of the institution,” she said.

But some said they welcomed a new chapter without McConnell at the helm.

“I presume since some of the division is reflected against his leadership, new leadership will unify the caucus,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has been critical of McConnell over Ukraine and other issues, said he would prefer he step aside even sooner.

“We’ve got to turn the page here as a party,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The 81-year-old incumbent, who would be 86 at the end of a second term, is likely to face Donald Trump, who is 77.

The exam found Biden, at 6 feet and 178 pounds, in good shape physically. “President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,” the report concluded.

Biden’s longtime physician, Kevin C. O’Connor, oversaw the physical and consulted a range of other specialists. Since the president’s previous physical, in February 2023, “this year’s physical identified no new concerns,” O’Connor said. He highlighted several issues that Biden’s medical team has addressed over the past year, including Biden’s stiff gait, sleep apnea and a root canal.

“The overall read is stability,” said Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine and surgery at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences. “When I see a patient for a physical exam after six or 12 months, that’s what I’m looking for: What’s changed?”

He added, “This report doesn’t show a lot of change in the objective elements. That’s reassuring. It’s the report of an 81-year-old man. Eighty-one-year-olds have certain things that are chronic and common.” Biden, for example, takes medication for cholesterol, gastric reflux and seasonal allergies.

It was notable, however, that there was no cognitive portion of the report, Reiner said. Current guidelines do not necessarily suggest a routine cognitive exam for an 81-year-old, he said, unless it is recommended by the patient, caregiver, or physician because of a cognitive issue.

“The other reason to test him would be a political reason,” Reiner said. “There very well may be a political reason since it’s been so high on everyone’s radar screen. But apparently they didn’t feel it was warranted. But that’s the glaring absence from the report.”

Biden’s cognition and memory took center stage earlier this month when special counsel Robert K. Hur said a jury probably would see him as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” Democrats angrily criticized the report, arguing that Hur is not a physician and is not qualified to make such a judgment.

Republicans have clamored for Biden to undergo a cognitive test, saying it is necessary to have confidence in his ability to lead the country. Those demands have been led by former White House physician Ronny Jackson, who administered such a test — the Montreal Cognitive Assessment — to Trump in 2018.

Trump has since boasted about his performance on the test, which is aimed at detecting dementia or cognitive decline, but has also distorted how the test is administered, and what the results signify. Jackson, who has since become a Texas congressman, has also faced scrutiny for how he served as a White House physician and some of his claims about Trump’s health — including his quip that Trump could “live to be 200 years old” if he only ate healthier.

O’Connor did remark on the president’s stiff gait when he walks, which he has attributed in the past to a foot fracture Biden suffered in 2020. The doctor wrote that he assembled a team to examine and assess the president, and they determined that much of his stiffness is the result of wear and tear on his spine.

“An extremely detailed neurological exam was again reassuring in that there were no findings which would be consistent with any cerebellar or other central neurological disorder,” he wrote. That could indicate that his stiff gait is not the result of other issues such as stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s, O’Connor said.

Biden also has “no tremor, either at rest or with activity,” and he “demonstrates excellent fine motor dexterity,” according to the report.

Under “Social History,” O’Connor wrote, “The President has been happily married for 46 years. He does not use any tobacco products, does not drink alcohol, and he continues to work out at least five days per week.”

Biden has also had some left hip discomfort recently. He will continue with physical therapy and exercise, the physician said, focused on strengthening his lower extremities and stabilizing his core. “We have added a more intensive stretching routine to the President’s exercise prescription, and he has been regularly participating in this program at least four to five times a week,” O’Connor wrote.

The physical also took note of how Biden has started using a CPAP machine to help with sleep apnea, the White House said, making him one of the millions of Americans who use the device to treat apnea, a sleep disorder in which a person’s breathing stops and starts frequently while sleeping.

“Given the importance of efficient sleep for anyone, but certainly for a senior executive, we revisited the issue this past spring, and conducted a formal sleep study,” O’Connor wrote. The study indicated that Biden would benefit from using the device to optimize his sleep.

After trying out several different types of masks, he said, several products were selected that Biden has used successfully. “He has been remarkably committed to sticking with therapy and uses PAP successfully almost every night, for most or all of the night,” the physician wrote.

Biden also had a root canal this past year, using local numbing medication and having no complications, which was disclosed at the time of the procedure.

Earlier in the day, Biden was asked about his physical and he told reporters, “I’m all right. Everything is squared away.”

Asked if there was anything concerning that Americans should know about, he joked, “They think I look too young.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight But this week, Graham voted repeatedly against sending $60 billion in aid to that nation as well as against other military funds for Israel and U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific. The longtime hawk dramatically announced on the Senate floor that he also would no longer be attending the Munich Security Conference — an annual pilgrimage made by world leaders to discuss global security concerns that’s been a mainstay of his schedule.

“I talked to President Trump today and he’s dead set against this package,” Graham said on the Senate floor on Sunday, a day after the former president said at a rally that he would let the Russians do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO allies that did not spend enough on defense. “He thinks that we should make packages like this a loan, not a gift,” Graham said.

The Senate passed a $95 billion national security package to aid Israel, Ukraine and other U.S. allies early Feb. 13 after a monthslong debate. (Video: The Washington Post)

Graham’s about-face on Ukraine aid sends a stark warning signal to U.S. allies that even one of the most aggressive advocates for U.S. interventionism abroad appears to be influenced by the more isolationist posture pervading the Republican Party.

It marked a departure for the senator who was harshly critical of Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy when he ran against him for president in 2015, in part on a message of launching a U.S. invasion of Syria. And even as he cozied up to Trump once he became president on numerous other issues, the Air Force veteran continued to criticize Trump on foreign policy, including for wanting to withdraw from Afghanistan and Syria.

With his latest move, Graham has tied himself even tighter to Trump as the former president moves toward clinching the Republican nomination.

The episode has also eroded Graham’s credibility among colleagues who worked closely with him to shape a bipartisan package of border policy reforms that Republicans demanded be attached to the foreign aid in exchange for their votes — only to backtrack and help kill it in the end.

Graham’s work on the border measure was a throwback to his earlier Senate role as a dealmaker on immigration, including as a key member of the failed Gang of Eight immigration group in 2013 and a Trump-era negotiating group in 2018. But now firmly in the MAGA wing of the party, Graham was one of the senators imploring GOP leadership that border security must be part of any Ukraine bill last fall.

The senator appeared sincerely interested in getting a deal through, publicly defending the negotiations from right-wing attacks and arguing that the policy could help Trump if he wins reelection.

“To those who think that if President Trump wins, which I hope he does, that we can get a better deal — you won’t,” Graham told reporters in January. “You got to get 60 votes in the United States Senate.”

But some negotiators believe Graham’s tone changed after a mid-January visit with Trump at the former president’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, according to people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter candidly. Shortly after the visit, Trump began posting more harshly against the bill, and Republican senators began defecting from the deal before it was even announced. Graham began raising more pointed concerns about whether the parole provisions of the deal were strong enough.

Still, Graham stayed at the table as negotiators worked to assuage his concerns. He pushed for a tougher rollback of the president’s use of parole at land ports of entry, which was eventually agreed to after Graham signed off while he was in Saudi Arabia. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), a key negotiator, ran point on the relationship, ensuring that Graham was happy with the final deal. But Graham’s shifting demands prompted her to privately refer to him as a “chaos monster” at times, according to two people who heard her use the term.

Just a few hours before the text of the deal was released, Graham praised it in an interview on the “Fox News Sunday” program. “I hope people keep an open mind,” he said. “If you believe, as President Trump does, our laws are broken, then you got to fix them.”

But the day after the deal was released — amid a Republican backlash, a declaration from House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) that it was “dead” and an angry retort from Trump — Graham backed away from the plan, to the annoyance of others involved in the negotiations. (Graham was not alone, however. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who also helped negotiate the deal, also abandoned it amid the GOP furor.)

The tensions between Graham and Sinema from the final weeks of the negotiations spilled out onto the Senate floor last Thursday after just four Republicans voted to pass the bill. She interrupted his floor speech bemoaning the inadequacies of the border deal. Sinema repeatedly pointed out to Graham while he was speaking that he helped negotiate the deal and that the only way to introduce the changes he claimed he wanted was to vote to proceed on the bill and then offer amendments.

“You don’t have a snowball’s chance of getting it passed in the House,” Graham angrily retorted.

At one point in his short speech, Graham called the policy in the deal “good” and at another point a “half-ass effort,” before yielding the floor. He then began talking once more — just long enough to tell the prime minister of Poland, who had criticized Republican senators who voted against the deal, that he “could care less” what he thinks.

The display provoked anger from some of his fellow negotiators.

“His top staff were in the room when we negotiated the bill,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wrote in a social media post about the Sinema-Graham back and forth. “We negotiated key provisions directly with him.”

Graham not only backed away from the border deal, but he also declined to join 22 of his GOP colleagues on Tuesday to support the foreign aid package after it was stripped of the border provisions.

The drastic change of heart — even in a politician who has shown a chameleon-like proficiency at adapting to the Trump takeover of the GOP — has prompted speculation that Graham could be worried about his political standing in his pro-Trump state or that he may have his eye on a Cabinet position in a future Trump administration.

“Graham’s always worked on the premise that he’s going to do what it takes to be in the room where he thinks he can have influence … but for those who’ve watched his independent streak over the years, it is perplexing,” said Chip Felkel, a communications strategist who has worked on multiple Republican campaigns in South Carolina. “After the passing of John McCain, we have seen less and less of that independent streak.”

Graham was a longtime foreign policy ally of McCain, an Arizona senator, but the two began to part ways on some issues before McCain’s death in 2018.

Others speculated that Graham, who is not up for reelection until 2026, might be responding to the intensity of feeling in the GOP base on Ukraine. “Going against Trump [on Ukraine] right now is a death sentence,” said one Republican House lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the political backlash they have faced. “It’s kind of risky for him at this point, given how angry the base is.”

Graham and his staff declined an interview request for this story. But the senator attempted to explain his shifting position in an hour-long floor speech on Monday. He slammed isolationism as a worldview, criticized a lack of adequate defense spending in the United States, and said it “breaks my heart” that the United States pulled out of Afghanistan.

But he also declared he would not support the aid package, after thinking about the issue for “days” and acknowledging a “tug of war” between him and Trump on foreign policy. He said he had visited Iraq and Afghanistan more than 50 times, often with his friend McCain, and that U.S. withdrawal from its role around the world would only embolden autocrats.

“But having said all of that, for me to be able to convince people in South Carolina to continue to support conflicts overseas, I have to prove to them I get it when they tell me what about their own country,” Graham said. “So I’m not going to Munich. I’m going to the southern border.”

He encouraged the House to change the package by making the aid a loan, among other things.

The announcement came as a shock to those who have watched Graham’s career. He served as co-host of the bipartisan delegation to the international Munich Security Conference in recent years, a group that nicknamed itself the “McCain delegation” after the late senator who was a fixture at the conference. In 2017, Graham declared to world leaders gathered in Munich that it would be “a year of kicking Russia in the ass in Congress.”

John Herbst, a former ambassador to Ukraine during the George W. Bush administration, said Graham’s U-turn on Ukraine aid is “not a positive message” for allies. “This really is a time for people who understand American national security interest to stand up,” he said.

McCain used his last trip to the Munich conference to reassure U.S. allies that Trump’s view of the world — and hostility to NATO — would not shake congressional support for the current world order.

“His old buddy Senator McCain has got to be rolling in his grave right now,” said Jim Manley, a former top aide to Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) when Reid was Senate leader. “They struck a very hawkish, pro-U.S., pro-interventionist stance time and time again. Now when the stakes couldn’t be higher, he’s bending the knee to the demands of Donald Trump.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Republican legislators and interviewers challenging the president’s son on the House majority’s behalf would throw out an allegation, often one that’s been worn smooth after tumbling around in the right-wing media universe for the past year or two. And Biden would invariably swat it away, stripping off the layers of innuendo that had been applied by Donald Trump and Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) or Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) or any of myriad Fox News commentators.

This included epic battles against well-known foes, like an exchange between Hunter Biden and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), or repeated, extended back-and-forth with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.). But at no point was a question left unanswered — including through an invocation of the Fifth Amendment — or, to an objective observer, left answered with obvious incompletion.

The discussion was centered on the Republican effort in the ongoing impeachment inquiry to demonstrate that President Biden had benefited financially from Hunter Biden’s business endeavors — and, they hoped, that the elder Biden had used his position as vice president to that end. They were unsuccessful in making that case from the hearing’s first moments.

“I did not involve my father in my business,” Hunter Biden said in his opening comments, “not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions, domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist, never.” His position did not diverge from that at any point; instead, he frequently invoked this same claim over and over again as a means of cutting off one of the familiar lines of inquiry with which he was presented.

The effect, in reading a transcript of Wednesday’s hours-long interaction, is of a man repeatedly trying to get his accusers to see a forest instead of a smattering of trees.

Hunter Biden’s testimony centered heavily on two themes. First, the closeness of his family, having been drawn together by the tragic deaths of his mother and, later, his brother. This is why he always took his father’s calls, he said, and why he would always welcome his father to join him at dinners.

Advertisement

“I can't count the number of times my dad stopped to have dinner with me and my family,” he testified — including at a cafe that was situated between the White House and the vice-presidential residence.

The other was that Joe Biden was a career politician.

“My dad has been a United States Senator since I was 2 years old,” Biden said at one point. “My whole life has been this.”

His point? That glad-handing strangers and dropping into events was part of his father's daily life — and therefore his own.

At one point, a questioner pressed Biden to admit that there was a suspicious pattern in his father having met people with whom Hunter Biden or his partners ended up doing business. Biden rejected that framing.

“The pattern I see is that you literally have no evidence whatsoever of any corruption on the part of my father,” he said. “And therefore what you're trying to do is you're trying to make every single thing in business that I was ever involved in somehow corrupt.”

Advertisement

Gaetz, during his lengthy inquisition of Biden, attempted to portray several occasions in which Joe Biden called his son during a meeting or stopped by a dinner as implicating the president in his son’s business. Hunter Biden turned the question around.

“If my father was to sit down here today and he was to call me right now and I was in and I put him on the speakerphone, does that mean that he had a meeting with you, Mr. Gaetz?” he asked.

“Yeah,” Gaetz replied.

Gaetz later tried to suggest that since Hunter Biden sometimes covered his father’s tab, that his and his father’s finances “were pretty interwoven.” (“Will the record show that we’re all laughing?” Biden attorney Abbe Lowell interjected.)

“No, our finances aren’t interwoven,” Hunter Biden said in response. “What are interwoven is that we’re a family.”

Over and over, interlocutors presented Hunter Biden with the sorts of suspicious-sounding tidbits that have been the crux of the Republican argument for months. And, over and over, he offered credible responses.

Biden was asked, for example, whether he was aware that money he’d transferred to his uncle James Biden might have been reused by his uncle to repay a loan to his father.

“This is the most ridiculous thing that — I mean, so far,” Biden replied. “Are you saying to me, do I understand the fungibility of dollars? Do I understand that there is a — I mean, what is it? Post hoc ergo propter hoc? It’s all based upon a fallacy?”

He noted that the deal at issue was centered on building a liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana that, according to him, would have created 17,000 jobs.

Mentioning this had a different purpose: to bolster his credentials and, by extension, the validity of his having been hired to participate in these agreements in the first place. He fleshed out the specifics of several of them in a similar way, including offering details of his relationships with prospective partners, both close and contentious.

“I’d put my résumé up against any one of you, in terms of my responsibility,” he challenged the lawmakers at one point.

Those deeply immersed in the lore of Joe Biden’s putative corruption will find any number of the allegations dismissed in Hunter Biden’s testimony, not that they will believe his (sworn) testimony if they were to read the transcript at all. They would also note two particular targets of Hunter Biden’s ire: Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Hunter Biden’s former associate Tony Bobulinski.

Kushner served as a repeated point of comparison for Biden: Republicans were quizzing him on his father stopping by a dinner one evening when Kushner pulled in $2 billion after leaving the White House?

A legislator asked him whether he'd worked for foreign governments.

“I never worked for a country,” he replied. “I am not Jared Kushner.”

Bobulinski, whose testimony has been repeatedly cited by Republicans as their probe has progressed, was dismissed by Hunter Biden as only briefly involved in his endeavors — and as having been bounced for being unreliable. Among the transgressions, he said, was that Bobulinski had hoped to gain leverage over the Biden family name, something that Hunter Biden found particularly offensive.

He had “no faith in this person that I had just met, Tony Bobulinski,” he said, “who was presented to me as some Wall Street whiz kid that was going around, throwing around my name, and throwing around my family's name.”

“It's not their name to screw up,” he added at one point. “It's mine.”

This relates to where Hunter Biden’s testimony was the shakiest. He indicated that, thanks to those decades of being immersed in his father’s world, he was sensitive to keeping his father at arm’s length.

“One thing that we — that I was fully aware of my entire life, is that my dad was an official of the United States Government,” he said, “and there were very bright lines that I abided to and that I was very, very cognizant of. And made certain that I never engaged with my father in asking him to do anything on my behalf or on behalf of any client of mine.”

That may be, but it has also been demonstrated that he at times specifically sought to invoke his father, including in a text message in which he falsely implied that his father was sitting beside him. (He said he was probably intoxicated when it was sent and that he was “more embarrassed of this text message, if it actually did come from me, than any text message I’ve ever sent.”)

Toward the end of his deposition, Biden deflected one of Gaetz’s questions about the specifics of his picking up a bill for his father by noting how deep his questioners were having to dive to find things that looked suspicious.

“It’s not incumbent upon me to point to you to something that doesn’t exist,” Biden said. “It’s incumbent upon you to create something, to come up with something based upon the voluminous evidence that you’ve collected, which shows no involvement.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

In the fundraising effort’s description, Cardone explains that she stands “unwaveringly with President Donald Trump” in opposition to “an attack on the very ideals of fairness and due process that every American deserves.” She called on “business owners and entrepreneurs to unite, to show our collective strength and resolve,” standing with Trump by helping to pay off his fine.

Cardone has put her money behind Trump before, contributing more than $10,000 to his 2020 reelection bid. Many of the other 22,500 or so donations (as of writing) are also likely to have come from previous Trump donors. This time around, they’ve cobbled together more than $1.2 million so far to help Trump meet his financial needs.

But those needs are very different from when people have contributed in the past.

As The Washington Post explained Monday, that $350 million-plus is only part of what Trump owes. There’s another $83 million-plus that he was ordered to pay for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. Then there’s the interest, adding to the cost at more than $100,000 a day. New York Attorney General Letitia James is keeping a public running tally of what Trump owes — now more than $464 million.

The interest alone demonstrates the problem. Cardone’s fundraiser began more than a week ago, during which time more than $1 million in interest has been added to what Trump owes. The GoFundMe is ostensibly aimed at raising the $355 million sum imposed by Engoron but in reality has barely raised enough to cover that interest. And, as you might expect, contributions have slowed from its initial burst: The fund has added less than $100,000 in the past two days, from Sunday to Tuesday.

Trump has been effective at getting people to give him money since he entered politics, certainly. After insisting to Republican voters during the 2016 primary that he could pay his own way to the nomination, he embraced individual contributions. During that cycle, his campaign raised more than $333 million, including about $87 million from small donors. In 2020, his reelection campaign pulled in nearly $774 million, including almost $380 million from small donors.

That latter total would be enough to cover what he owes New York. But that’s not going to happen.

First of all, he has only 30 days to come up with the total judgment if he hopes to appeal. Unless the court decides differently, he can’t simply avoid paying until appeals are resolved; he has to provide the total amount in the interim.

Advertisement

He might find a bond provider to help him do so, but, as The Post’s Jonathan O’Connell, Shayna Jacobs and Josh Dawsey wrote, that’s much trickier for Trump than it would be for others. Among other things, the judgment against him was specifically centered on the Trump Organization misrepresenting the value of its assets; what bonding company would feel confident that a building offered as collateral was worth what was being claimed?

Trump does have cash on hand, and potentially enough to hand over. But the Trump Organization also needs cash to operate its properties.

That 30-day window means that even if he could persuade supporters to give him money, he doesn’t have two years to do so. He was able, in the wake of his 2020 election loss, to persuade people to contribute more than $170 million in less than a month, money ostensibly focused on aiding his legal efforts. He would need nearly three times as much now, for a cause much less directly linked to his political ambitions.

Nor will the Republican Party bail him out. The party paid some of Trump’s bills soon after he left office, but that’s tricky with Trump still slowly working his way toward renomination as the GOP’s presidential candidate. A prominent member of the Republican National Committee is trying to prohibit such payments entirely, introducing a resolution that would keep the party from paying Trump’s legal bills. Not that the RNC has the cash anyway; it had only $8 million in the bank at the beginning of the year.

It should go without saying that the central issue here is the size of the penalty Trump owes. Bloomberg News estimates that there are 178 Americans among the world’s richest people, cumulatively worth about $3.7 trillion. The median net worth of these billionaires, though, is a more-modest $9.2 billion — meaning that just putting up the judgment imposed by Engoron would demand cobbling together about 4 percent of their net worth within a month.

Trump is not among those richest Americans.

Just before the former president lost the 2020 election to President Biden, Trump issued an executive order designed to gut civil service job protections for workers across the government. It would have paved the way for the workers to be replaced with others, including political partisans, subject to termination at will — a move the Republican president backed because he felt nonpartisan bureaucrats were hampering many of his policies.

Trump has promised to reinstate the directive, which Biden quickly revoked after his inauguration. It created a new federal employment category, Schedule F, that would make federal jobs vulnerable to partisan political whims by weakening guardrails meant to ensure a nonpartisan bureaucracy.

Trump’s order in 2020 was supposed to be limited in scope, only applying to employees “in positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character” — a category projected to affect about 50,000 workers.

But one agency’s documents, obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), indicate that in fact the Trump administration’s plans were far bigger.

At its annual legislative conference Tuesday, NTEU released more than 200 pages of records it obtained demonstrating how Russell Vought, Trump’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director, planned to include a huge swath of his agency’s workforce in the order.

Vought “absurdly stretched the definition of policy work to cover the vast majority of the OMB workforce, from attorneys to GS-09 assistants and specialists who have nothing to do with setting government policy,” NTEU said in a statement.

A spokesperson for Vought did not respond to a request for comment.

Civil service protections provide due process for feds who are disciplined or dismissed, leading critics to argue that they make it too hard to fire them. Ultimately, however, it is the American public that benefits from these rules.

Due process prevents the White House and its political appointees from dumping employees for partisan reasons. While top-level agency employees are political appointees who advance a president’s agenda, civil servants are charged with implementing those policies in a nonpartisan manner. Due-process procedures for the civil service are designed to protect the public by ensuring it is served by a nonpartisan, nonpolitical bureaucracy. The 1883 Pendleton Act was passed to promote a federal workforce based on merit, not partisan bias.

Federal labor leaders are on offense now in case they must play defense next year if Trump is reelected and follows through on his promise to resurrect Schedule F. That’s one of several GOP policies — including Republican legislation that would roll back telework programs — that worries leaders at NTEU and other unions.

With Trump fully dominating the Republican primary season and strongly challenging Biden in presidential polls, the unions want to safeguard the protections while they can.

“Resurrecting Schedule F in the next Republican administration is designed to get rid of even more federal employees than anyone realized,” said NTEU President Doreen Greenwald. “That number could be much higher [than the 50,000 estimate] and sweep up all kinds of employees around the country,” she told reporters.

In fact, a 2022 Government Accountability Office report found that Schedule F would have applied to 68 percent of OMB’s small but powerful workforce. Although OMB is more of a policy-making shop than many agencies, anything near that percentage government-wide would severely upend the civil service, rendering it unrecognizable.

The OMB documents released by NTEU indicate that not only high-level OMB policymakers would be subjected to Schedule F. Mid-level administrative support assistants, office managers, program examiners and program specialist positions as low as GS-9 on the 15-level General Schedule employment scale also would be affected, according to the union.

Trump’s campaign did not reply to request for comment on the labor organization’s statements, but his intentions are clear.

When he released his “plan to dismantle the deep state” last year, Schedule F was item No. 1.

“First,” Trump said in the plan, “I will immediately reissue my 2020 executive order restoring the president’s authority to remove rogue bureaucrats. And I will wield that power very aggressively.”

But Biden administration plans could temper Trump’s aggression.

NTEU, which represents employees in 35 federal agencies and offices, filed a petition in December 2022 asking the Office of Personnel Management to issue regulations that would ensure employees shifted to a future Schedule F would retain their civil service protections. NTEU’s proposal also would establish procedures for OPM and other federal agencies to follow before moving workers from competitive civil service positions.

Five months later, fear of another Trump administration fueled union urgency.

“I ask you to direct OPM to act on NTEU’s petition promptly, so that regulations can be finalized before the 2024 election,” then-NTEU President Anthony Reardon wrote to Biden in May.

OPM’s proposed regulations would do what NTEU requested and define high-level policy positions “to mean noncareer, political appointments.” OPM also would provide employees the right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board if an action “purportedly strips employees of their civil service status and protections.”

The creation of new non-civil service employment categories “would be unnecessary and contrary to good administration principles,” says NTEU’s petition. “But if new schedules are created … such shifts must be done consistent with civil service laws and merit system principles.”

OPM expects the regulations will be final in April. “OPM is committed to protecting the rights of federal workers who deliver critical services for Americans in every community,” said Viet Tran, OPM’s press secretary.

Legislation introduced last year by Rep. Gerry Connolly and Sen. Tim Kaine, both Virginia Democrats, would prevent employees from being reclassified out of the civil service without congressional approval. The House bill has Republican co-sponsors, including Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.).","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Of the four congressional caucuses, House Republicans have stuffed the bills that fund the federal government with more than $4.5 billion worth of narrow projects in their districts, commonly known as earmarks. That’s more than half a billion more dollars than their next closest competitor, the Democratic caucus in the Senate.

Yet, when the first chunk of spending bills hit the House floor in a few days, Republicans expect to struggle to round up votes for a legislative package even though they will include almost all of their earmarks. On Thursday, just 113 Republicans, about 54 percent of their caucus, voted for a stopgap bill averting a partial government shutdown, while all but two Democrats supported the bill.

Remarkably, it will have to be Democrats who unlock the gusher of federal earmarks into House GOP districts. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is only expected to deliver little more than a third of the vote needed in favor of the overarching legislation that will provide full-year budgets for agencies.

It’s the latest example of what Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in her last two years as speaker, dubbed the “vote no and take the dough” phenomenon among Republicans.

With earmarks once considered the gateway drug to congressional corruption, the tea party-driven House GOP majority banished them in 2011 from funding bills after Justice Department investigations landed several lawmakers in prison and dozens more former staff received felony sentences.

But as the work of the House and Senate Appropriations committees languished year after year, leading to a pair of weeks-long shutdowns last decade, Democrats decided to bring earmarks back when they held the majority, starting with the 2022 fiscal year.

Advertisement

The idea was to instill rank-and-file lawmakers with personal skin in the appropriations game, setting up a detailed process to weed out ethical conflicts and require local support for what are now formally called “community funding projects.”

Requests were initially limited to 10 or fewer, and the overall funds were limited to 1 percent of the total budgets for federal agencies.

Democrats nearly universally embraced these projects, but House Republicans were reluctant. Barely half of them requested earmarks in 2022, while former congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), then the minority leader and part of the leadership team that banned them a decade earlier, declined these funds.

But after they won the majority in late 2022, House Republicans voted by a more than 3-to-1 margin to continue the earmark process exactly as Democrats had reestablished it.

Advertisement

According to analyses by CQ Roll Call and Bloomberg Government, about two-thirds of House Republicans stand ready to collect earmarks from the latest work by the Appropriations Committee.

Has this transformation helped Republicans learn the ropes and support the overall legislation?

“To some degree,” Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a veteran member of the spending committee, told reporters Thursday.

As they wrote their own sharply partisan funding outlines last summer, House Republicans had several very close votes, which, without earmarks, might have failed to win a majority.

“It’s hard to vote against a bill when the committee and staff have done everything they can to try to address the issues that you want to address,” Simpson said.

Advertisement

That’s a very old-school view of congressional politics, when it was understood that if lawmakers had millions of dollars designated for their individual districts, they were expected to support the overall legislation.

Yet dozens of Republicans will probably thumb their nose at that traditional view in the next few days.

Take Rep. Tim Burchett (Tenn.), who was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy as speaker in early October after McCarthy allowed a stopgap funding bill to pass — mostly with Democratic votes — to avoid a shutdown. He voted no, again, on Thursday on the very brief stopgap bill.

Burchett has warned Americans will “lose our country” over the national debt, but he still submitted roughly two dozen earmark requests worth more than $50 million, ranging from $2.5 million for the East Tennessee Children’s Hospital to $5.4 million to refurbish a Knoxville concert amphitheater to $100,000 to boost genetic testing for state law enforcement.

Members just need to be able to “stand up and defend each and every one of them,” Burchett said. “You know, if we need a hospital, we need a hospital. We need a road? We need a road. And that is a duty of government.”

Does he feel more invested now in voting for either of the two upcoming funding packages, totaling almost $1.7 trillion, since his projects will be included?

“I don’t have any obligation at all,” Burchett said.

Democrats grew irritated last summer as House Republicans steered such a huge amount of earmarked funds in their direction.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, oversaw the relaunch more than two years ago. Back when only half of Republicans requested them, the distribution represented a close to 2-to-1 value for the majority.

“The dollar amount was predicated on the number of requests,” DeLauro told reporters Thursday.

Advertisement

But Republicans took that split and adopted it as precedent for the majority party. They awarded themselves more than 62 percent of all earmarks, according to The Washington Post’s Jacob Bogage’s analysis in January, easily the largest haul.

Senate Democrats have claimed close to $4 billion in earmarks while Senate Republicans stand to get $3 billion. House Democrats will get more than $2.7 billion.

After about a third of their members declined these projects, House Republicans are dividing up the biggest earmark pie with far fewer lawmakers than their Democratic counterparts.

That results in, according to the CQ Roll Call analysis, a gusher of funds for those House Republicans wanting earmarks.

Of the 100 largest recipients of earmarked dollars in the House, 97 are Republicans.

And House Republicans have looked out for their politically vulnerable members — 10 of the 16 GOP lawmakers representing districts that favored President Biden in 2020 have collected earmark hauls that place them in the top third of the entire House, according to CQ Roll Call.

Advertisement

House Republicans also limited earmark requests to just seven of the 12 annual bills, eliminating projects from some more liberal-leaning measures like the one that funds the Departments of Labor, and Health and Human Services. They also nixed earmarks for the Defense Department, caving to far-right lawmakers who accuse Pentagon leaders of becoming “woke.”

They even blocked three community projects Democrats had won initial approval for, because they funded LGBTQ+ projects.

Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) had his $1.8 million request for an LGBTQ+ community center in Philadelphia approved and then blocked, so he instead worked with DeLauro and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the Senate Appropriations chair, along with his state’s Democratic senators, to get $1 million for the project in the Senate bill.

Democrats believe their vetting process has stood up over the past few years and that only political reasons prompted these actions.

“The nature of the projects and reviewing them has been very positive,” DeLauro said.

Some staunch conservatives even regard earmarks as the constitutionally mandated role of Congress, with lawmakers better suited to know their district’s needs than agency bureaucrats.

One such Republican is Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), another of the eight who voted to oust McCarthy in early October. He initially requested a whopping $141.5 million for a naval air base in his Florida Panhandle district, which would have been one of the largest earmarks in the House this year.

The old-school ethos on Capitol Hill might have led to punishing Gaetz, who led the effort to first block McCarthy’s ascension to speaker in January 2023. Instead, his request was honored, at a reduced rate, for $50 million, which places him among the top 15 recipients in earmark funds.

He, however, regularly votes against the Appropriations Committee’s bills, just as he did on Thursday by voting no on the stopgap bill.

Simpson wishes more Republicans would embrace his panel’s work given that so many have a lot at stake for their districts.

He wonders if many Republicans will vote no in the next few weeks, even as they take the dough in earmarks.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

McConnell has led his party’s Senate caucus since George W. Bush was president, making him a central player in the Republican evolution since.

When the tea party emerged in the first months of Barack Obama’s presidency, McConnell was one of the party leaders who tried to figure out how to repurpose the movement’s energy toward more useful ends — an effort that was not entirely successful. Then Donald Trump emerged in 2015, and that energy became more focused and more intense. In this new era, McConnell — a politician’s politician — managed the complicated tension between Trump and traditional party politics more capably than many.

But, weakened by age and with Trump’s grip once again tightening on the GOP, McConnell surrendered.

“Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time,” McConnell said from the Senate floor. “I have many faults. Misunderstanding politics is not one of them.”

The party, more than ever with McConnell’s withdrawal from leadership, is Trump’s.

The evening before McConnell’s announcement, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley spoke with CNN’s Dana Bash. Results in the Michigan presidential primary had started to come in and Haley, very much as expected, was trailing Trump badly.

Haley offered criticism of Trump’s approach to foreign policy — which, as it turns out, is exactly what McConnell said next during his floor speech 15 hours later. In response, Bash posited that perhaps Haley’s problem was less with Trump’s approach than with the probability that “the party has moved, and the party is about Donald Trump.”

“It is very possible,” Haley conceded, which is a bit like saying that it is possible that the sun is too hot to touch.

The results of the primary contests to this point demonstrate that Haley is losing the battle over the meaning of Republicanism. Trump keeps winning a majority of votes cast by Republicans, including more than 7 in 10 Republican votes in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Haley’s support is much more heavily rooted in independent and Democratic voters. In New Hampshire, 7 in 10 votes she received came from people who told exit pollsters they weren’t Republicans. Even in her home state of South Carolina, more than a third of her support was from self-identified independents.

In other words, it is not only possible that the Republican Party has moved to be about Trump, it has obviously done so. While she does get Republican support, her frequent insistence that she represents the 40 percent of the party who opposes the former president is misleading. The Haley campaign is a bipartisan anti-Trump campaign involving skeptical Republicans, independents and Democrats who cross party lines. This is one reason that she keeps outperforming polls: more Trump-hostile voters show up to vote than are anticipated by pollsters.

That the GOP is the party of Trump was encapsulated in a moment on Fox News’s coverage of the primary Wednesday morning.

“Former president Donald Trump picked up another primary win last night in Michigan,” host Harris Faulkner said. “Again, he beat the only remaining Republican candidate to challenge him at this point, Nikki Haley, by a lot.”

The screen showed the current margin: Trump, 68 percent; Haley, 27 percent.

“On the Democratic side, Biden also secured a victory,” Faulkner continued. “But his biggest challenger had a very big showing. Look at that number on the right: that’s 13.3 [percent].” Half what Haley had, in other words, but Fox News toes the party line and, for the party, Trump is dominant even when maybe he isn’t.

There had been rumblings in recent days that McConnell was about to offer his support for Trump’s candidacy, something that he has so far been loath to offer. Again, McConnell, more than most, had been effective at keeping Trump at something of arm’s length, acquiescing to the former president’s whims more often than not but, at times, presenting enough of a roadblock that Trump would lash out. That McConnell has held out after even his No. 2, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), fell in line was notable. But now Trump is within reach of something better: McConnell’s power.

That’s true across the party. Former House speaker Kevin McCarthy is now a private citizen, for example. He was one of the House Republicans seen as the establishment connection to the tea party, but his hard-fought ascent to the speakership was cut short by hostility from the Trump-loyal wing of the House caucus. He was replaced by Mike Johnson (R-La.), a figure much more cloaked within Trump’s shadow.

Ronna McDaniel, tapped to run the party by Trump, announced that she would step down after Trump publicly criticized her. Her departure means the power of the Republican National Committee is also up for grabs, with Trump allies — including a family member — lined up to take over.

Observe the change just over the last decade. In February 2014, former Ohio congressman John A. Boehner was speaker and McConnell minority leader in the Senate. Former RNC lawyer Reince Priebus ran the party. Donald Trump was a real estate guy who’d pop up on Fox News once a week to opine on politics.

Ten years later, Trump is poised to hold all of the GOP’s strings. A party that worked for decades to build power as an institution is now mostly in service of one individual.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The higher the percentage of White Christian residents in a county, PRRI determined, the more support that county tended to have for Trump.

This week, PRRI published a more narrowly refined set of data, looking at a subset of Christian thought in the United States: Christian nationalism, the idea that the United States should be an explicitly Christian nation. And once again, the data indicate a strong correlation with support for Trump.

This chart from 2021 shows the connection between the margin of support in a county and the percentage of White Christians in that county. You can see that the cloud of dots, each representing a county, goes up and to the right. The more White Christians (further up), the bigger the margin for Trump (further to the right).

Last year, PRRI asked a wide swath of Americans to evaluate several statements oriented around the idea of instituting Christian nationalism. Some were explicit: “The U.S. government should declare America a Christian nation,” for example. Others were more esoteric: “Being Christian is an important part of being truly American.”

Advertisement

From the responses, PRRI categorized respondents into one of four groups. Two were supportive of Christian nationalism, including the most supportive of the statements (adherents) and those who were generally supportive (sympathizers). The other two groups were hostile to the ideas, from those who mostly disagreed (skeptics) to those who rejected all the ideas (rejecters).

Using this scale, PRRI estimated the percentage of each state’s population that was supportive of Christian nationalism — that is, that were adherents or supporters. Nationally, about 3 in 10 Americans fell into this category, with 1 in 10 as “adherents.” But at the state level, support would at times near 50 percent. In Mississippi, half the population was estimated to be supportive of the precepts of Christian nationalism.

This can be compared to support for Trump in 2020. And when we do so, we see a clear correlation: a cloud of state labels moving up and to the right.

States like Maryland, with relatively few supporters of Christian nationalism, voted for Trump at very low levels. States like Mississippi backed him robustly.

If we compare the 2020 results to just the percentage of Christian nationalism among the White population in each state, the correlation gets tighter.

Support for Christian nationalism among a state’s White population, in other words, was a strong predictor of support for Trump in 2020.

Advertisement

This isn’t surprising, certainly. Support for Christian nationalism is higher among less-educated Americans, older Americans and White evangelical Christians, PRRI found. Those are all groups that are central to Trump’s base of support. This data also doesn’t tell us how causation might work: Are Christian nationalists drawn to Trump or are Trump supporters drawn to Christian nationalism?

Of course, Trump stokes the idea that he is a champion — the champion — of America’s Christian population. He makes explicit appeals to the role of Christianity that Christian nationalists support. His presumed goal is that support for Trumpism and Christian nationalism grow stronger together.

PRRI also found that the religious group second-most likely to embrace the ideas of Christian nationalism were Hispanic protestants, 55 percent of whom fell into the “supporters” group — and 1 in 5 of whom were “adherents.” The correlation here is very loose, but it is worth noting that Hispanic voters have shifted to the right, particularly since 2020.

Advertisement

It’s also worth noting that support for Christian nationalism has been flat over the past year, according to PRRI’s research. It’s not the case that this is a strongly pro-Trump category and a growing one; we can’t point to this and make predictions about Trump’s electoral position, for example.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

ArrowRight The prosecution referrals became public Friday and add to the legal troubles of the former president, who is already facing 91 charges in four cases in other jurisdictions.

The Wisconsin Ethics Commission this week found probable cause that Trump’s Save America committee, a state lawmaker and multiple local Republican officials committed felonies and recommended six district attorneys investigate and prosecute them, according to records released Friday.

The commission’s investigation centers on the 2022 primary race between Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, one of the most influential Republicans in Wisconsin, and Adam Steen, a political newcomer who embraced Trump.

Individuals and most political entities can give a maximum of $1,000 each to candidates for the Wisconsin Assembly under state law, but arms of political parties can give them unlimited amounts. The commission alleges that Steen, his campaign and three county Republican parties arranged to sidestep campaign finance laws by having donors give money to one of the county parties, which would then steer it to Steen’s campaign or his vendors, according to the records released Friday.

Save America donated $15,000 to the county parties in August 2022 — $5,000 each to the Republican parties of Chippewa, Florence and Langlade counties. They are the only donations Save America made to county parties in 2021 and 2022, campaign finance records show.

Neither the Trump campaign nor Steen responded to requests for comment Friday. The website WisPolitics first reported on the referrals.

The ethics commission made its referral against Save America and its agents but did not identify anyone with Save America by name. It alleged that those involved in the efforts committed felonies that can result in penalties of up to 3½ years in prison and fines of $10,000. Additional penalties could be in play if prosecutors pursue conspiracy charges.

In addition to Save America, the commission referred for prosecution Steen’s campaign, the three county parties and nine individuals, including county party officials and donors.

Vos has had a tumultuous relationship with Trump for years, especially since the former president baselessly alleged the 2020 election in Wisconsin was rigged against him.

Hoping to appease Trump and his supporters, Vos hired a former state Supreme Court justice to conduct an election review, which centered on conspiracy theories and false claims that the legislature could revoke the state’s electoral votes for Joe Biden.

Trump claimed Vos did not pursue the investigation with enough vigor and endorsed Steen as he made his out-of-nowhere primary challenge to Vos in 2022. Vos narrowly won that primary, and now Steen’s allies are gathering signatures in hopes of holding a recall election of Vos.

Special investigators hired by the commission determined Steen’s campaign advised those who wanted to give more than $1,000 to his campaign to make their donations to the Republican Party of Langlade County — a rural outpost in northern Wisconsin that is more than 200 miles from the district in southeastern Wisconsin where Steen was challenging Vos. Steen’s campaign told donors to write “63” in the memo line of their checks to the county party, in an apparent reference to Vos’s district number, according to the referral.

In all, more than $40,000 went to Steen’s campaign through the Langlade County party, according to the ethics commission.

Steen recorded many of his phone calls, and the conservative website Wisconsin Right Now obtained copies of them in late 2022. The recordings include one in which Terry Brand, the chairman of the Langlade County party, told Steen they would later identify another county party to help “wash that money.”

“We’re playing musical money here, right?” Steen said during that phone call, according to the recording.

Brand said in an interview that he was joking when he mentioned finding someone to “wash” money and noted Vos sponsored the state law that allows parties to make unlimited donations. “I think everything we did was perfectly legal,” he said.

Vos appointed one of the six ethics commissioners, and Brand said he believed the commission was coming after him and the others because they had opposed him. “Robin Vos wants to make sure that nobody ever dares to support a candidate that’s running against him,” Brand said. Vos declined to comment.

The Langlade County party’s support for Steen was widely known, which may have inspired donors to give to it, said Brand and Leonard Boltz, the party’s vice chairman. The county party has been focused on getting rid of Vos because he hasn’t done more to investigate the state’s elections and has blocked attempts to remove the state’s nonpartisan elections director, Boltz said

Brand and Boltz said there was never an agreement to help donors get around campaign finance limits by giving to the county party. The commission recommended charges against both.

“We got our money from people and we sent a fair amount of that money to Adam Steen, but it was never directed to do that,” Boltz said. “There was never a contract. Nothing was signed. Nothing was — verbally, there was nothing. So this is a baseless charge.”

State Rep. Janel Brandtjen (R), who in 2022 served as chair of the Assembly’s elections committee, was also part of the alleged scheme, according to the commission. Brandtjen did not respond to requests for comment.

The ethics commission consists of three Republicans and three Democrats. It referred charges to Republican prosecutors in six counties because Wisconsin law requires campaign finance cases to be prosecuted where the alleged perpetrator lives if they are a state resident. For out-of-state residents and entities, such as Save America, the alleged violations are prosecuted where they occurred.

If the district attorneys do not act within 60 days, the commission has the authority to refer its request for prosecution to Attorney General Josh Kaul (D). Under state law, the commission must conduct most of its investigative work in secret. It is rare for it to pursue serious charges.

Patricia Hanson, the district attorney in Racine County, said she would make a decision quickly on the referral the commission made against Steen’s campaign. Waukesha County District Attorney Sue Opper said she needed more information from the ethics commission before she could determine how she would proceed. Karl Anderson, the district attorney in St. Croix County, said he did not know how long he would need to determine what to do with a referral he received.

Other prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Jean Carroll  The Washington Post","After Donald Trump was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll, his legal team and his defenders lodged a frequent talking point. Despite Carroll’s claims that Trump had raped her, they noted, the jury stopped short of saying he committed that particular offense. Instead, jurors opted for a second option: sexual abuse.

“This was a rape claim, this was a rape case all along, and the jury rejected that — made other findings,” his lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said outside the courthouse.

A judge has now clarified that this is basically a legal distinction without a real-world difference. He says that what the jury found Trump did was in fact rape, as commonly understood.

The filing from Judge Lewis A. Kaplan came as Trump’s attorneys have sought a new trial and have argued that the jury’s $5 million verdict against Trump in the civil suit was excessive. The reason, they argue, is that sexual abuse could be as limited as the “groping” of a victim’s breasts.

Kaplan roundly rejected Trump’s motion Tuesday, calling that argument “entirely unpersuasive.”

“The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape,’ ” Kaplan wrote.

He added: “Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.”

Kaplan said New York’s legal definition of “rape” is “far narrower” than the word is understood in “common modern parlance.”

The former requires forcible, unconsented-to penetration with one’s penis. But he said that the conduct the jury effectively found Trump liable for — forced digital penetration — meets a more common definition of rape. He cited definitions offered by the American Psychological Association and the Justice Department, which in 2012 expanded its definition of rape to include penetration “with any body part or object.”

Kaplan also flatly rejected the Trump team’s suggestion that the conduct Trump was found liable for might have been as limited as groping of the breasts.

The reason? Trump was not accused of that, so the only alleged offense that would have qualified as “sexual abuse” was forced digital penetration. Beyond that, Trump was accused of putting his mouth on Carroll’s mouth and pulling down her tights, which Kaplan noted were not treated as alleged sexual abuse at trial.

“The jury’s finding of sexual abuse therefore necessarily implies that it found that Mr. Trump forcibly penetrated her vagina,” Kaplan wrote, calling it the “only remaining conclusion.”

Kaplan also noted that the verdict form did not ask the jury to decide exactly what conduct Trump had committed, and that neither prosecutors nor Trump’s lawyers had requested it to do so.

“Mr. Trump’s attempt to minimize the sexual abuse finding as perhaps resting on nothing more than groping of Ms. Carroll’s breasts through her clothing is frivolous,” Kaplan wrote.

He added that the jury clearly found that Trump had “ ‘raped’ her in the sense of that term broader than the New York Penal Law definition.”

The motion was a part of Trump’s efforts to appeal the verdict against him. That’s an effort that will apparently continue as he faces a separate defamation lawsuit from Carroll, dealing with claims Trump made about her allegations while he was still president.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The Republican National Committee disclosed that it had $9.1 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 30, the lowest amount for the RNC in any Federal Election Commission report since February 2015. That compares with about $20 million at the same point in the 2016 election cycle and about $61 million four years ago, when Trump was in the White House.

The Democratic National Committee reported having $17.7 million as of Oct. 30, almost twice as much as the Republican Party, with one year before the election.

“It’s a revenue problem,” Tennessee RNC member Oscar Brock said. “We’re going through the same efforts we always go through to raise money: the same donor meetings, retreats, digital advertising, direct mail. But the return is much lower this year. If you know the answer, I’d love to know it. The staff has managed to tighten down on expenses to keep the party from going into the red.”

Donors have not cut as many large checks to the RNC in recent years, and the party’s small-dollar program has also suffered, according to people familiar with the party’s finances, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal party details. Some donors aren’t giving to the RNC because they think that will help Trump, which they don’t want to do, these people said, while others have said they prefer to wait until 2024 to give. Some have grown frustrated with the party’s leadership, people close to major donors said.

The party cut certain expenditures this year after projected money did not come in, according to people familiar with the decisions.

An RNC spokeswoman said the party has nonetheless deployed staff in 15 swing states to start working on get-out-the-vote efforts and election monitoring. The party is also pursuing 70 lawsuits in 19 states challenging voting rules and is encouraging Republicans to use early voting and mail ballots — methods Trump and his allies have disparaged, even as RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel repeatedly touts the importance of the “Bank Your Vote” initiative.

All federal party committees — Democratic and Republican — have seen downturns in revenue since 2021, a trend that operatives usually attribute to inflation and donor fatigue. And occasionally during the Trump presidency, the DNC had about as much money on hand as the GOP has now, records show.

In an interview, McDaniel said that donors are currently more focused on giving to individual candidates during the presidential primary and that the party’s fortunes will improve once there’s a nominee.

“I think there’s more donors just fully committed to their candidate right now, saying I am all in, and once the nominee is set, I’ll be there. That’s what I hear more than anything. And they’re really solidly in the camps of their candidate, which is normal,” McDaniel said. “There’s nothing unusual about this, because they know that once their candidate gets in that we will merge and that we’ll be working together to win the White House.”

The party’s spending buttresses the Republican presidential nominee’s campaign along with down-ballot races in the Senate and the House of Representatives. In 2020, the party was flush with cash, while the Trump campaign pulled advertisements because of a cash crunch. RNC officials say the party currently has no debt.

Still, the RNC’s dwindling cash position — combined with Republican losses in this month’s off-year elections, frustrations over the 2022 midterms and grousing over the chaotic presidential primary debates — has caused renewed questions about the committee’s effectiveness and McDaniel’s leadership.

“The RNC’s electoral record since 2017 speaks for itself,” said Virginia RNC member Patti Lyman, who opposed McDaniel when she was elected to another term in January. “The damage from that chair election goes far beyond the drop in donations. Our base was demoralized.”

McDaniel, who took over as RNC chairwoman in 2017, is the party’s second female leader and has been reelected three times. Outside her office, portraits of the 61 men and one woman who led the party before her adorn the walls. She has tried to walk a tightrope, sticking close to Trump while also keeping anti-Trump members close, her allies say, earning majority support among the committee’s 168 members.

The Wisconsin and Iowa GOP chairs sent unsolicited statements to The Washington Post praising McDaniel’s leadership of the party.

“She has strong support within the RNC. She won 110-plus votes during the election in January, and I think she has stronger support now than in January,” said Michael Whatley, the North Carolina state chairman. “I think her and the RNC team are focused on what they need to be focused on right now.”

Whatley said that the party needs “to raise more money” but that he believes that will be remedied next year.

Maybe most important for McDaniel, Trump continues to back her — although more tentatively than in the past — and associates her with his 2016 win, advisers said. In an Oct. 28 speech, Trump said that McDaniel has “done a fantastic job” and called her “a real good friend.”

Advertisement

Still, he has publicly and privately expressed disappointment with the RNC holding presidential debates over his objections. His team believed that McDaniel would not continue with debates after his statements, and he expressed surprise when she announced new ones.

“RNC must save money on lowest ever ratings debates. Use it against the Democrats to STOP THE STEAL! If not, REVAMP THE RNC, NOW!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social last week.

And Trump has also voiced doubts about the RNC’s readiness for the 2024 campaign and commitment to fighting what he insists, without evidence, is voter fraud.

Some of his senior advisers have continued to complain to him about McDaniel, though she has a defender in Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief adviser. “He doesn’t like [that] she says she is ‘neutral,’” a Trump adviser said of McDaniel.

Donors sometimes complain to Trump about McDaniel, and Trump has been asking people what they think of her, which is often an ominous sign that someone is losing their standing with him, according to three people close to the former president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions. People close to both McDaniel and Trump say they have frequent and friendly conversations.

A Trump spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.

Republican frustrations burst into the open this month after GOP losses in races for the Virginia legislature, the Kentucky governorship, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and on an Ohio ballot initiative on abortion rights.

In October, the RNC rejected a request for additional funding for the Virginia GOP this fall, said the state party chairman, Rich Anderson. RNC officials said they had budgeted based on a meeting earlier in the summer with Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s team in which they didn’t ask for money.

Other state party officials have grown frustrated when they’ve asked the RNC for money to pay legal bills and been turned down, according to people familiar with the discussions.

In TV and podcast interviews after the elections, McDaniel repeatedly defended the RNC’s refusal to pay, arguing that federal campaign finance laws limit the national committee’s involvement in state elections. In fact, there are no limits on RNC transfers to state parties.

McDaniel has also faulted Republican campaigns for avoiding the subject of abortion instead of adopting a message she has encouraged, to prevent abortion after 15 weeks and allow for a range of exceptions. And her allies say that many of the election losses she has been blamed for were elections in which Trump was widely viewed as the main issue on the ballot.

Numerous conservative organizations have ginned up online attacks on McDaniel, questioning the party’s spending and preparedness — and her loyalty to Trump.

During the third GOP debate, candidate Vivek Ramaswamy went so far as to call on McDaniel to resign. An online video showed Ramaswamy talking before the debate with right-wing influencer Benny Johnson, workshopping an attack on McDaniel and deciding to use it as his opening salvo in the debate.

The chairwoman said she believes other groups and critics have a financial interest in attacking her.

“When you have the RNC and when you’re in this position, there’s always going to be outside groups criticizing because it helps them raise money. They have to have a foil, right? So you’re going to go against the RNC because it helps your organization raise money and do things,” she said.

While Trump has been demanding that the RNC cancel future debates, Ramaswamy and other trailing candidates have complained about the qualifications, format, scheduling and moderators. Trump has grown agitated that the RNC is having them at all. The RNC took over organizing the debates in 2015 because of campaigns’ dissatisfaction with the media-run free-for-all forums in the 2012 primary.

“I think we’ve taken it a step further by having a small-dollar donor component and also reasonable polling thresholds that I think are very, very reasonable, but also eliminating that double debate stage,” McDaniel said, referring to the situation in 2015 when lower-ranking candidates in the large field debated separately. “The RNC is always going to be a bit of a punching bag.”

But that approach this year has made the RNC the target of criticism, and some top Republican Party officials have privately conceded that the debates have often gone off the rails.

“Who in the world would schedule a debate on the same night as the Country Music [Association] Awards unless you were actually trying not to reach Republican primary voters?” said former RNC executive director Scott Reed, referring to the Nov. 8 debate. “I don’t believe the party should be in the debate business. Let the conservative marketplace decide, and let the campaigns decide where they want to show up. It’s been a colossal failure.”

The attacks have take a personal toll on McDaniel. People close to her said she has not been enjoying the job this year. They said she assiduously monitors criticism online and has frequently complained about the difficulties of her job.

“Republicans have the infinite capacity to eat our own and participate in circular firing squads as opposed to attacking the real culprits for America’s decline,” said Steve Hantler, an adviser to megadonor Bernie Marcus, who supported McDaniel’s opponent in January’s election for party chair.

McDaniel appeared unfazed during her visit to a meeting of the South’s RNC members this month, according to Jonathan Barnett, an RNC member from Arkansas who supported McDaniel’s challenger in January.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The decision dealt with a separate judge’s order this month in a civil fraud case that imposed millions of dollars in punishments, plus interest, against Trump and other defendants including his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.

New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron had determined in that case that Trump and others had given false data to financial institutions and insurance companies so they could borrow money at lower rates and save on costs. Engoron hit Trump with the hefty financial penalty and gave him and his sons years-long bans from holding top jobs in New York corporations, among other punishments.

On Wednesday, Trump’s lawyers asked an appeals court judge to stay Engoron’s judgment, which they assailed as “unprecedented and punitive.” His attorneys also sought to post a $100 million bond rather than the fuller amount, which they suggested could top $500 million, and suggested that if a stay was not granted, the defendants could be forced to sell properties.

Associate Justice Anil C. Singh in the New York State Supreme Court’s Appellate Division swiftly rejected the attempt to delay the judgment. Singh did not directly address the request to let Trump post the $100 million amount, but his brief decision declined to delay “the enforcement of monetary judgment,” which appears to mean Trump has to pay the full amount.

Singh granted a temporary stay to Engoron’s directive that blocked Trump and his company from seeking loans from financial institutions in New York for three years, which Trump’s attorneys had suggested was a hindrance to posting the full bond.

Singh’s actions Wednesday could be altered or undone in the coming weeks. A full panel is expected to review the case and issue a decision on March 18.

Trump, who is running again for president, has faced a whirlwind of legal trouble and financial jeopardy. Even before Engoron’s judgment, Trump had been ordered by juries in two separate civil cases to pay nearly $90 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll, who sued him for defamation. Trump also faces charges in four criminal cases, including one set to go to trial in Manhattan next month.

While Singh’s order blocks part of Engoron’s decision, it leaves intact the part of that judgment that has loomed largest: the financial penalty.

Attorneys for Trump and other defendants had written in court filings that Engoron imposed a “facially absurd” financial penalty as part of “a zealous quest to inflict untoward punishment” in the case.

They also suggested that it was impractical to imagine he has such a cache of cash on hand. During the hearing before Singh, Christopher Kise, an attorney for Trump, said rounding up so much cash would be a hurdle for even the country’s wealthiest residents, lumping his client in with them.

“No one, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Donald Trump, has five hundred million laying around,” Kise said.

The case originated with a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), who accused Trump and other defendants — including his adult sons and the Trump Organization, the family company — of committing a years-long financial fraud.

Engoron heard the case without a jury, then released his decision on Feb. 16. He ordered Trump to pay more than $354 million in penalties, plus interest — putting the amount at more than $450 million. Both of Trump’s adult sons were also fined $4 million each.

James’s office pushed back on Trump’s desire to stay the judgment or let him post a lower amount, writing that there was “no merit” to the suggestion that posting a portion of the judgment would be sufficient. Instead, her office wrote, there was “substantial risk that defendants will attempt to evade enforcement of the judgment (or make enforcement more difficult) following appeal.”

During the hearing, Dennis Fan, an attorney speaking for James’s office, depicted Trump’s side as trying to wiggle out of giving up control of assets without saying they could not afford the full bond.

“I think if you read between the lines, what they’re saying is we don’t want to put up the collateral,” Fan said.

Attorneys for Trump and other defendants wrote in court papers that they planned to “secure and post a bond in the amount of $100 million.” An appeal bond, they wrote, would include the amount of the judgment, along with costs and interests during the appeal process, which could push the total bond amount to more than $550 million. They highlighted the blockade on loans as a hurdle to posting the bond.

“The exorbitant and punitive amount of the Judgment coupled with an unlawful and unconstitutional blanket prohibition on lending transactions would make it impossible to secure and post a complete bond,” the attorneys said.

The attorneys also raised the prospect of having to sell off properties if the stay was not granted as requested. Without such a stay, they wrote, “properties would likely need to be sold to raise capital under exigent circumstances.” Then, they wrote, even if the appeal succeeds, there would be no way to regain control of those properties or “recover the resulting financial losses.”

Engoron’s decision, coming on the heels of a separate $83.3 million judgment against Trump after one of Carroll’s lawsuits concluded last month, means he could face a significant cash crunch. Legal experts say that to keep the judgments from being enforced amid appeals, Trump must put up the entire amount in cash or bonds. Much of Trump’s wealth is entwined with real estate, so it remains unclear how much cash he has available or how he could put up the money.

Trump has repeatedly likened his properties to great works of art that he does not like to sell, but he has sold two recently: the lease to his luxury D.C. hotel, now a Waldorf Astoria, and the license to operate the Ferry Point golf course in New York City. Both properties were technically owned by the government, making them more complicated for him to own while president, unlike the vast majority of his portfolio.

He has made no public moves to recently list or sell the other top properties in his portfolio. Trump lists 22 assets — most of them real estate — as valued at “over $50 million” each, according to a Post analysis of a government filing he submitted in August.

Those include his stakes in Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, an office building at 40 Wall Street, golf courses and hotels. Some of his golf and hotel properties have suffered since his entry into politics, as Democrats and others opposed to Trump have avoided patronizing them, but they still produce hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for him annually.

Few of his properties carry debt, according to the form, meaning he would probably reap a large portion of any sale amounts after taxes. He has a $100 million loan on Trump Tower, in Manhattan, and a $125 million loan on his Doral resort in South Florida. Only one other property, 40 Wall Street, carries a loan of more than $50 million, according to the form.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

As Trump watched President Biden on television — stumbling through a Feb. 8 news conference over concerns about his age — Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, an Afghan war veteran with a Bronze Star and Purple Heart, gave the former president his best pitch for an endorsement over Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.), according to people familiar with the meeting.

Sheehy’s hole card was the benefactor who got him through the door, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Daines had been maneuvering behind the scenes for months to avoid any bloody intraparty primaries like the one potentially brewing in his home state. Twice previously, Daines brought Sheehy to meet with Trump — at Trump’s Bedminster, N.J., golf club and at a rally in South Dakota. Countless times, Daines had texted or spoken with Trump about the importance of a Sheehy endorsement.

Rosendale formally announced his Montana Senate campaign to unseat Sen. Jon Tester (D) the next day — only to be blindsided hours later by Trump’s endorsement of Sheehy. Mike Berg, the NRSC’s communications director, promptly posted a meme of dancing pallbearers carrying a coffin inscribed with Rosendale’s campaign logo and the words, “Feb. 9, 2024-February 9, 2024.”

The moment capped a banner year for Daines and his revitalized NRSC, effectively reviving the power of party bosses to shape Republican primary battles long before voters ever get a say.

Daines’s predecessor, former NRSC chair Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) liked to say that voters didn’t want “Washington to pick who the candidates are.” Daines has bet the 2024 cycle on the opposite proposition. Rosendale abandoned his Senate campaign after only a week.

“People are sick and tired of losing,” Daines said Tuesday, in an interview with The Washington Post explaining the strategy. “I have always said filing day is more important than Election Day.”

Just over a year in the job, Daines has all but cleared Republican fields in Indiana, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Montana for his chosen candidates. He has recruited former Maryland governor Larry Hogan (R) to put that state in play. He has discouraged multiple candidates, including former Indiana governor Mitch Daniels (R), from getting involved in primary contests, while appealing for muted infighting states like Michigan and Ohio. Most importantly, he has formed a close relationship with Trump, bridging the still-festering divide between the former president and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

Brutal primary battles and problematic candidates have been the bane of Republican Senate leaders since the first inklings of the tea party in 2010 and 2012, when Missouri Republicans nominated a Senate candidate who said “legitimate rape” rarely leads to pregnancy and Delaware got a nominee who campaigned with the slogan, “I am not a witch.”

The 2022 elections proved a spectacular continuation of that losing theme — with a hapless Georgia candidate, Herschel Walker, who had held a gun to his wife’s head; a struggling Pennsylvania TV doctor nominee in Mehmet Oz; and a mysterious Arizona contender, Blake Masters, who praised the Unabomber as an underrated “subversive thinker.” Even before Election Day, McConnell warned, “candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.”

McConnell now proudly praises Daines’s accomplishments. “I think we’ve got a good shot at having the majority,” McConnell said in a recent interview. “Daines is very much in my group of people who feel that you need a quality candidate.”

Democrats still argue that the 2024 Republican field remains problematic. Several of the GOP candidates — in Wisconsin, Montana and Pennsylvania, to name three — are vulnerable to attack because they have lived and worked out of state.

“Senate Republicans have recruited a roster of unvetted, carpetbagging losers with enough baggage to sink a ship,” said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “By the time voters learn the truth about their disqualifying flaws, they won’t be able to get elected dogcatcher.”

Voter concern about new abortion restrictions remains a Republican problem as well. Daines has also embraced some candidates who lost in 2022, including Kari Lake, who ran for governor in Arizona while denying the legitimacy of the 2020 election and is still appealing her 2022 loss in court.

“There is not a single candidate that we don’t have lock, stock and barrel on abortion,” said J.B. Poersch, president of the Senate Majority PAC, the top Democratic funder of television ads. “You can give them credit to trying to avoid records that they already have. But Daines and McConnell weren’t able to recruit candidates who didn’t already have a record on this stuff.”

Daines has responded by issuing clear marching orders to his own candidates on the issue of abortion — insisting that they all embrace exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother to any legal limits on the procedure — and calling on the party to collectively back in vitro fertilization procedures after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos were children and that people can be held liable for destroying them.

Daines said his party will be ready for the Democratic attacks.

“They are going to lie about our opposition to abortion any way they can,” he said. “We are not going to sit back and let them.”

Such tough talk has cheered Republican donors and leaders, who are daring to believe again that the Senate majority is in their grasp after two disappointing election cycles. Daines, who spent years as an executive at Procter and Gamble, has taken to pitching donors in private settings on the argument that this is the best chance Republicans will have for many more years to win seats.

With the retirement of Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), Democrats are almost sure to lose at least one seat in their 51-seat majority and many of the party’s incumbents face reelection in red and purple states this cycle. The Republican presidential nominee is also a lock to win Montana and Ohio in November, a tough headwind for Tester and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who are both seeking reelection. Democratic-held seats in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan will also be in play, as Democrats work to gain footing in only two states held by Republicans, Texas and Florida.

Steven Law — a McConnell ally who runs the Senate Leadership Fund, the largest super PAC supporting GOP Senate candidates — said he joked with GOP strategist Karl Rove in 2022 about how many times they found themselves thinking voters would have to “hold their nose” to vote Republican. This time he says, the NRSC has established an entirely different playing field.

“We have seen just a consistent workmanlike focus in getting us in the best position to win as possible,” Law said.

Much of Daines’s work has been out of public view. He worked to discourage Daniels from running for Senate in Indiana against Rep. Jim Banks (R), worried that the battle would expose disunity in race for a safe red seat. Daines also came out hard against former Michigan congressman Peter Meijer when he entered the race against Daines’s chosen Senate candidate, former congressman Mike J. Rogers (R)

Meijer continues to run, but Rogers is seen as the favorite in that state’s primary. Daines has also not tried to block a contested primary in Ohio, but has implored the candidates there to avoid the scorched earth negativity that wounded, but did not derail, the party’s nominee in 2022, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio).

Perhaps the biggest coup for the NRSC was the recruitment of Hogan, who declined similar offers of support in 2022. Over Christmas break, Daines’s chief of staff, Maryland native Darin Thacker, wrote a personal appeal for Hogan to run for the open seat in the state, which prompted a quick response from Hogan asking for a meeting, according to people familiar with the exchange.

Daines then commissioned polling in January that showed Hogan with a clear path to victory in the heavily Democratic state. Trump is not expected to weigh in on the Maryland primary, though there has been no deal brokered between the two camps, said a person familiar with the discussions. Hogan, a longtime critic of Trump, announced his campaign this month.

Daines’s ability to work with the former president has also been a key part of the job.

“He realizes that Trump’s a force,” Sen Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally, said. “Steve is really smart — he’s played all the moving parts well.”

Daines traveled to Mar-a-Lago in February 2023 for an obligatory thumbs-up photo with the former president, and became the first member of Senate leadership to endorse Trump’s presidential campaign months later. Before the Iowa caucuses, Daines worked to get his colleagues to come on board Trump’s campaign. Six Senate Republicans did so in the first weeks of January.

“There is an affinity between the two men,” said one Republican strategist familiar with the Trump relationship. “The president respects Senator Daines immensely, and Senator Daines is not all pomp and circumstance. He is just very straightforward. He is a western state U.S. senator.”

Daines has also managed the relationship with McConnell, a change from 2022 when Scott was in open war with the Senate’s Republican leader. The result is a Senate caucus that has been generally united. Daines declines all questions about whether he would be interested in continuing in Senate leadership after November, when McConnell, 82, may step back from his role as leader.

“My sole focus is making sure we are having a discussion about a future majority leader,” Daines said.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said Daines showed he was able to recruit quality candidates, dissuade less compelling candidates and “manage the Trump factor” all at once in the Senate race in his home state of Montana.

“Any one of these things could burn most people,” Cramer said.

Democrats, in the meantime, have not backed away from Montana, which may be the party’s last stand in their fight to hold onto Senate control. Millions of advertising dollars on both sides are expected to flood into the state later this year, though Democrats expect to have more money to influence voters.

“The resource gap is something that concerns me,” Daines admits.

Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said he believes Rosendale dropping out “doesn’t change anything” about his race.

“They’re literally going to do the same thing they’ve done the past three [cycles],” Tester said. “They try to make me into something I’m not so they can run against that person because they can’t beat who I am.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

At the dinner, the law clerks traded small talk with Jones Day lawyers over the restaurant’s Spanish seafood cuisine and bottles of wine. While jovial on its face, the Monday-night dinner was like other recruiting events in Washington: the firm and its prospective hires were vetting each other.

So goes the courtship of Supreme Court law clerks by Washington’s top law firms. Only around three dozen law clerks work for the justices during each one-year term, which means these lawyers — and their unparalleled knowledge of the court — are in incredibly high demand. Jones Day, the leader in the race to recruit and hire as many clerks as possible, announced last month that it snagged 8 law clerks, all of whom worked for conservative justices during the term that began in October 2022.

But they don’t come cheap.

During the courting process, the city’s top law firms treat this elite group of lawyers to perks like an expensive dinner at the Wharf or Penn Quarter or a trip to a baseball game or spa. The recruitment is so competitive that signing bonuses for Supreme Court law clerks have reached a new high — $500,000, according to a spokeswoman for law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Such a sum far exceeds the salaries paid to the justices — the clerks’ former bosses — who are paid slightly less than $300,000 a year.

The bonuses — alongside annual starting salaries of more than $200,000, which alone are nearly triple Americans’ median household income — are the product of a decades-long competition among elite law firms seeking any advantage they can find in arguing high-profile cases before the Supreme Court. They view the clerks’ experience and knowledge of the court as profitable assets that attract clients in a highly specialized sector of the law, and they see clerkships as effective filtering devices in identifying promising hires, according to interviews with former Supreme Court clerks, lawyers and experts.

In this way, the clerks are like many former aides across Washington — whether on Capitol Hill, at regulatory agencies or in the White House — whom law firms value because of their time spent in proximity to power and relationships with influential officials.

“Their knowledge about how the court operates is invaluable,” Neal Katyal, a former acting U.S. solicitor general who co-leads Hogan Lovells’s appellate practice, said of Supreme Court clerks. “Our clients love them.”

But some critics, including at least one former justice and some former clerks, have questioned whether the clerks are worth these enormous signing bonuses — which reached six figures in the early 2000s — and whether spending millions of dollars is sustainable.

“I was quite surprised with $75,000. I was shocked with $150,000,” said Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus, who studies the specialization of the Supreme Court bar. “It just boggles my mind.”

The half-million-dollar bonuses come as many other aspects of the court are under scrutiny. The public increasingly sees the court as a partisan institution rather than impartial arbiters of justice, polls show. And under pressure after news reports documented benefits like lavish trips that Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. received from wealthy members of the conservative legal world, the justices released an ethics code for themselves in November.

“The court has taken such a beating in terms of the public perception of the court — some of the beating is self-inflicted — but this isn’t good for the court,” Todd C. Peppers, a professor at Roanoke College who has written extensively about Supreme Court law clerks, said of the bonuses.

The beginning of the bidding war The bidding war over Supreme Court law clerks spans decades and coincides with the rise of lawyers who specialize in arguing before the high court. In 1985, Rex E. Lee, the solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan, resigned to become a partner at Sidley & Austin, a Chicago-based law firm. There, Lee and Carter G. Phillips created one of the first Supreme Court and appellate practices. To attract more business clients and bolster the practice in the long run, Phillips hired from the pool of young lawyers who were nearing the end of their Supreme Court clerkships. Rival firms like Mayer, Brown & Platt — now known as Mayer Brown — followed suit, increasing the demand for clerks. Phillips said in an interview that he realized convincing clerks to work in Washington for a law firm headquartered outside of the city was a “tough sell.” So, in 1987, he offered one of the first Supreme Court signing bonuses as a sweetener. It was $10,000.

“I was just talking to two people we were recruiting, trying to come up with some way to attract them to come to Sidley and the idea of a signing bonus popped into my head,” Phillips said.

“I said, ‘Would it make a difference if we gave you a $10,000 signing bonus?’”

It worked, and the race was on. Other firms began matching or exceeding Sidley’s number. In the mid-90s, the fledgling firm Kellogg, Huber & Hansen — now known as Kellogg Hansen — raised the price to $75,000, Lazarus said, setting off an arms race that has lasted decades. The firm would go on to hire Neil M. Gorsuch, who had clerked for Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy from 1993 until 1994. Gorsuch worked at the firm from 1995 to 2005. He joined the court in 2017.

Even adjusted for inflation, signing bonuses are now nearly 20 times greater than the first $10,000 offer made 37 years ago.

“I did not envision the bidding war that came into being as a consequence of when I tossed an idea off the top of my head as part of a recruiting effort,” Phillips said.

‘A crash course in appellate advocacy at the highest level’

Clerks spend a year — sometimes two — learning the ins and outs of the appellate field. They screen petitions, discuss the cases with their justice, prepare questions for oral arguments, and draft orders and opinions.

Clerking is “a crash course in appellate advocacy at the highest level,” said Daniel A. Rubens, a partner at Orrick who clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2013.

Phillips said a former clerk’s knowledge of how the court operates and what clerks who review petitions are looking for enhances their ability to write successful petitions to the court.

“In a world where virtually every law firm — at least in D.C. — claims to have a Supreme Court practice, there is a continuing demand for former clerks because they understand the process,” he said. “They’ve been there.”

Law clerks also understand how the justices think and approach cases, said another former Supreme Court law clerk, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of repercussions to their work before the court.

When former clerks return to the court years later as appellate litigators, they are 16 percent more likely than non-clerks to win the vote of the justice they clerked for when deciding a case, according to a 2020 study in Political Research Quarterly. The justices are also 14 percent more likely to side with their former clerk over one of their colleague’s former clerks, the study found.

To avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of impropriety, the high court has placed conditions on the hiring of their law clerks. They are barred from working on “any case pending before this court or in any case being considered for filing in this court” for two years.

But the clerks’ court experience still offers firms plenty of value from the start, Rubens said. Most of their work is done in lower appeals courts, which requires the same researching, writing and speaking skills as Supreme Court cases, he said.

Others say the guidance for clerks lets them discuss the court’s dynamics. “There’s nothing that stops them from talking about their evaluation of where the court may be heading and what arguments might be more useful in particular situations than in another,” said Stephen Gillers, a judicial ethics expert at New York University’s law school.

Another reason firms are so eager to hire law clerks is because of the likelihood that they will bring prestige to the firm.

Six of the nine sitting justices are former clerks. Firms want to hire and nurture these “superstar” lawyers, Lazarus, the Harvard Law professor, said.

But firms also want to bring in revenue. They do that by using clerks’ knowledge and potential to attract clients.

“That’s what the firms are about. They’re about making more money,” Lazarus said. “They’re doing it because they think it will lead to more clients. That’s the bottom line.”

‘A curious kind of solicitation’

Former Supreme Court justices have at times raised concerns about the bidding war over their law clerks.

In 1986, New York-based law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore began offering $20,000 bonuses to “beginning lawyers arriving directly from a clerkship who have clerked for at least two consecutive years in two different courts,” according to previously unreported internal court documents found in former Justice Harry Blackmun’s papers at the Library of Congress.

That March, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger sent a memo to the other justices, calling the letter “a curious kind of solicitation.” He wrote that he looked into whether the bonus violated a law prohibiting government officials and employees from receiving outside payments for performing their official duties. Burger concluded the firm’s bonus did not break the law.

Twenty years later, when the Supreme Court signing bonus eclipsed the nearly $200,000 salaries of federal judges, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy complained during a congressional budget hearing that it “devalues the position of the judiciary.”

“Something is wrong when a judge’s law clerk, just one or two years out of law school, has a salary greater than that of the judge or justice he or she served the year before,” Kennedy told senators the following year.

Little has changed since Kennedy’s complaint to lawmakers nearly 20 years ago as one-time signing bonuses continue to outpace the justices’ salaries.

A race with no end in sight?

Jones Day is leading the race to recruit and hire as many Supreme Court law clerks as possible. The firm has hired 22 clerks since the October 2020 term and 86 since the October 2011 term, according to the firm’s website.

Gibson Dunn in comparison, hired 12 clerks since the October 2020 term, while Kirkland & Ellis hired eight, according to a Washington Post survey.

Although a clerk who went to the Jones Day dinner said that the firm spoke to clerks who worked for every justice, all of the firm’s 2023 hires clerked for a conservative justice during the October 2022 term. The recruitment is part of a five-year trend that corresponds with the emergence of a revolving door between the firm and Trump administration officials, including Donald McGahn. McGahn worked at Jones Day both before and after he served as Trump’s first White House counsel.

“The firm’s profile is not attractive to clerks who have clerked for liberal justices and themselves have liberal views,” Gillers said. “I think this is self-selection.”

The law clerk who attended Jones Day’s recruiting dinner last year decided not to apply to work at the firm, citing other career interests.

Jones Day did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

It’s unclear if or when the bonus rate will hit a ceiling.

“As long as it’s viewed as a valuable commodity, the market is going to continue to value it in a competitive way,” Phillips said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

But, no matter. He’d seen enough. “I think this was a great deposition for us,” he told reporters waiting outside the hearing room. “It proved several bits of our evidence that we’ve been conducting throughout this investigation. But there are also some contradictory statements that I think need further review. So this impeachment inquiry will now go to the next phase, which will be a public hearing.”

When they arrived at the microphone once the testimony had ended, Democrats scoffed.

“To quote Congressman Issa, who was there, it was a big nothing,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the committee. “Although I would amend it by saying it was a little nothing. Everything that we learned was what we knew before, which was that President Biden is not involved and has never been involved in his son’s businesses.”

Much of the hearing, he said, involved “picking over the flotsam and jetsam of this shipwrecked investigation.” When asked about the possibility of a public hearing, Raskin shrugged.

“I don’t see any particular purpose for doing that,” he said, adding that “if that’s something that the parties agree to, we would have no objection to it because I suppose the whole country can see what an absurd waste of time this has been.”

How do we reconcile these two ideas, that Comer is so confident his side made progress and Raskin is so confident that they didn’t? Easily. Comer and his Republican allies have proved immune to the evidence contradicting their assertions for months. That immunity certainly extends to Hunter Biden, who they view as hopelessly dishonest. If objective reporting fails to dent the protective barrier that surrounds Comer, why would claims offered by someone named Biden?

Ahead of Hunter Biden’s appearance, the Oversight Committee on Tuesday published a lengthy thread of allegations on social media. Many of the posts were flatly erroneous, nearly all were in some way misleading. Others were simply irrelevant to the putative question at hand, whether Joe Biden did something untoward. What the posts compiled, though, were the elements of the narrative that has been propagated by the joint efforts of House Republicans and the right-wing media. They were little slices of Foxnewsium presented to Biden-haters like a charcuterie tray.

Before the hearing began, Comer again insisted that Hunter Biden had several shell companies, which is misleading. He said a Russian woman had paid millions to Hunter Biden, which was disproven by one of Comer’s witnesses. He insinuated that $200,000 Joe Biden received from his brother James in repayment of a loan was nefarious. He at least more accurately described the investments received through Hunter and James Biden’s work as involving some of their associates; previously, he’d claimed that the Bidens took in $20 million.

His allies appear either to not be paying much attention to the specifics here or to trust Comer’s presentations or both. That’s a mistake. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) appeared on CNN as Hunter was offering his testimony and repeated the $20 million thing, only to have the anchor point out that he was wrong. Not how one ideally wants a cable news appearance to go.

We don’t yet know many specifics about what unfolded in the deposition. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) told reporters that Hunter Biden had contradicted other witnesses, which is almost certainly true. After all, his former business partner Tony Bobulinski has claimed nearly everyone else is lying (which has generated at least one embarrassing response). Only Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) offered a specific point on which Hunter Biden was supposedly caught being dishonest.

“He talked about not being involved in anything between Blue Star Strategies,” she said, “but yet we presented an email that showed he was involved.”

There you go. Later asked what grounds for impeachment might exist, she confidently asserted, “influence peddling, for one. We can see that he sold his father’s name and business.” Of course, that describes Hunter, not his father. Impeaching Hunter Biden would, in fact, be a lower hurdle to clear.

What’s important is that people like Greene and the right-wing media have been agitating for impeachment for months. They believe — and many Republicans believe — that impeachment is warranted. Republicans believed that before the impeachment inquiry began. There’s a huge demand to hold a president they see as corrupt to account. Since the reality of the flimsiness of Comer’s case rarely penetrates their media universe and because denials from Hunter Biden are going to be dismissed out of hand, there’s no reason not to move forward.

Well, except that they have already held one public impeachment inquiry hearing and it went poorly. Comer and other Republican leaders did a little cleanup on Fox News a few hours later, but Comer later said he didn’t think public hearings were useful.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight At the start of what was seven hours of contentious questioning and adamant rebuttals, President Biden’s son gave a statement that was defiant, emotional and combative. “I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,” he said, according to a copy of the statement obtained by The Washington Post. “Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.”

House Republicans have not been able to uncover firm evidence that Joe Biden benefited from — or played a role in — the business pursuits of his family members, the assertion that is at the heart of their investigation of the president. The testimony from Hunter Biden followed an appearance from the president’s younger brother James, who also testified last week that Joe Biden never played a role in his businesses. Several other former associates of Hunter and James Biden have made similar statements, all under penalties of lying to Congress.

Republicans hoped that Hunter Biden’s appearance before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee and the Judiciary Committee could provide them with a final chance to alter the trajectory of an impeachment inquiry that so far has produced mostly exculpatory statements, despite Republicans’ efforts to prove that the president benefited improperly from his family’s businesses.

But emerging from the hearing, Republicans could not point to any major new revelations and Democrats argued that the record argues strongly for shutting down the impeachment effort.

“This has been a comedy of errors from the beginning,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said ahead of the hearing. He urged Republicans to “fold up the circus tent” and end the impeachment inquiry.

“We have gotten extremely far afield from the constitutional standard” for impeachment, Raskin said. “Nobody on their side can state what they think Joe Biden did, even as a private citizen, that would constitute some kind of criminal offense.” The U.S. Constitution says the president can be impeached and removed for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”

The GOP leaders of the inquiry say they have uncovered information suggesting that the president did benefit from the foreign business dealings of his family members and that he used his position to help them.

Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, emerged from the deposition late in the afternoon and said “it proved several bits of our evidence” without being more specific. He also said there were “some contradictory statements that I think need further review.”

“So this impeachment inquiry will now go to the next phase, which will be a public hearing,” Comer said, leaving without answering questions. “I think that the public hearing hopefully will clear up some discrepancies between some of the statements that were made between some of the associates and what we heard today. But all in all, I am very optimistic, very excited about this deposition.”

Hunter Biden had initially demanded that his testimony be given in public — saying that otherwise Republicans would cherry-pick and leak selected quotes — before eventually agreeing to do it behind closed doors but with a transcript released as soon as possible. It is unclear whether the president’s son will now agree to a public hearing as well.

“After seven hours of questions, the Republican majority ends the day where they started,” Hunter Biden’s attorney Abbe Lowell said in a brief comment after the deposition. “They have produced no evidence that would do anything to support the notion that there was any financial transactions that involved Hunter with his father, period.”

“It seems to me that the Republican members wanted to spend more time talking about my client’s addiction than they could ask any question that had anything to do with what they call their impeachment inquiry,” he added.

Several minutes before, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had pointed to some of Hunter Biden’s comments about addiction during the interview.

“Hunter Biden can’t hide behind his addiction, which is heartbreaking,” Greene said. “When pressure was placed on Hunter Biden, he swung back to being, you know, a poor, pitiful addict. And then when he wanted to brag about things, well, he was the smartest and most successful businessman in the room.”

During the questioning, Hunter Biden was asked about a 2017 email in which a business associate, James Gilliar, suggested that 10 percent be set aside for Joe Biden, referring to him in the email as “the big guy.” Hunter disputed the account and said that Gilliar was “out of his mind” for making such a suggestion, according to a person familiar with the deposition.

He was also asked about a WhatsApp message, sent to a Chinese businessman on July 30, 2017, in which he suggested that he was sitting next to his father and wanted the businessman to take action. In his testimony, according to the person familiar with it, Hunter Biden said that he was high or drunk when he sent the message. He also said that he sent it to the wrong recipient, and was not sitting next to his father at the time.

In his opening statement Wednesday, Hunter Biden noted that the credibility of several witnesses cited by Republicans has since been undermined, including Alexander Smirnov, who has recently been charged with lying to the FBI about the Bidens. He also provided as an exhibit a two-page résumé, making the case that he had the necessary qualifications for the jobs and business opportunities that he was pursuing.

“For more than a year, your Committees have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad,” Hunter Biden said, according to the statement. “You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any.”

Hunter Biden, who has acknowledged that he spiraled into a major drug addiction for a period, said he has had his share of failures and flaws, but he said that those should reflect on him and not his father.

“To be clear, I have made mistakes in my life, and I have squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that,” he said. “But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live.”

He said that his father was there for him during his battle with addiction and that “he helped save my life.”

“His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son and brother,” he said. “What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.”

After the first hour of Hunter Biden’s testimony, both Democratic and Republican members emerged from the hearing room to offer their accounts of what had transpired.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) said that Hunter Biden had not invoked the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination during the questioning but that he repeatedly said he could not recall certain events.

“Hunter Biden is being defiant and also dishonest,” Mace said. “His testimony, some of it, is in direct conflict with other witnesses.” She would not go into detail which witnesses or what aspects were in conflict.

While Hunter Biden’s team has often expressed frustration that few Democrats have come to their defense, a large group of Democratic lawmakers stood at the microphones during a break and did exactly that, albeit with a range of sometimes strained metaphors.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said the hearing was a “deep sea fishing exploration,” while Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said that for Republicans, it amounted to “fourth and 20 on their own 10, and they don’t have Patrick Mahomes.”

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) agreed. “That first hour of this much-anticipated testimony was the nail in the coffin to what is a bogus and sham impeachment inquiry,” he said.

President Biden, who has kept a light schedule during other moments of crisis and controversy for his son, had a relatively busy day that included a physical to gauge his health and an event on efforts to fight crime. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre largely dismissed the deposition and urged Congress to move on to other issues.

“We think it’s a stunt that has dragged on months and months and months. It’s uncovered zero evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden,” Jean-Pierre said at the daily White House press briefing. “The core premise of their inquiry continues to fall apart.”

Hunter Biden arrived on Capitol Hill shortly before 10 a.m. Wednesday, pulling up in a black Suburban and joined by Lowell. He kept quiet as he entered.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

“I had 24-25 hours of private meetings with him when I was vice president, traveled 17,000 miles with him. I know him pretty well.”

— Biden, in an interview with Norah O’Donnell of CBS News, Feb. 7

“I’ve spent more time with Xi Jinping, at least before we got out, than any world leader has. I traveled 17,000 miles with him, the president of China. … we traveled around the world together, in the United States and China.”

— Biden, at a campaign rally in Sparks High School, Nevada, Jan. 10, 2020

During his recent town hall on CNN, President Biden made a number of mistaken claims and assertions. He suggested racehorse owners receive tax breaks worth $9 billion, almost enough to pay for free attendance at community college — a claim that left tax experts scratching their heads. He said that the $7.25 minimum wage set in 2009 would be worth $20 if indexed for inflation, a statement that only makes sense if you are measuring from 1968. He wrongly stated that “vast majority” of undocumented immigrants were not Hispanic.

We became interested in the claim that he had “traveled 17,000 miles” with Chinese President Xi Jinping. We had first noticed it when the president was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell but it seemed like a typical Biden malaprop. After, it did not make much sense because world leaders do not often travel together. But he then said it again. Researching the matter, we discovered he had also used the same phrase during the presidential election campaign — and the same number even earlier than that.

When a politician says the same thing at least three times, it cannot be shrugged off as a verbal stumble. What is Biden talking about?

The Facts

Biden is justifiably proud of his long relationships with many world leaders. He came into office with a list of overseas contacts unmatched by any predecessor since George H.W. Bush, also a former two-term vice president. Before being elected vice president, Biden was chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for more than two decades.

During the Obama administration, it became clear that Xi, then the vice president, was in line to become the next leader of China. He was largely a mystery to U.S. officials, so Biden was assigned the task of getting to know him.

In 2011, Biden traveled to China and over the course of three days met with Xi in various settings. They had a bilateral meeting and formal dinner in Beijing on Aug. 18, co-hosted a business dialogue on Aug. 19 and then visited the city of Chengdu in Sichuan province, along with a high school about 50 miles away in an area where a 2008 earthquake had left 86,000 people dead or missing. They also had a lengthy dinner together in Chengdu. Afterward, Biden flew on to Mongolia.

In 2012, Xi visited the United States. On Feb. 14, Biden and Xi gathered at the White House for meetings, including with President Barack Obama, had lunch at the State Department, conducted a business roundtable and finally had dinner at the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory. Xi then traveled elsewhere in the United States, including Iowa, before arriving in Los Angeles. Biden flew to Los Angeles to meet Xi there on Feb. 17; they had dinner, among other events.

Biden returned to China in 2013, where he held another five hours of meetings with Xi. Biden also met Xi when he arrived in Washington on his first state visit as Chinese president in 2015.

That’s certainly an impressive amount of face time with Xi. But Biden’s mileage number has kept us puzzling till our puzzler was sore.

As far as we could tell, the only time Biden and Xi appear to have traveled together was when they visited Qingchengshan High School in Dujiangyan. In theory, one could add in the trip from Beijing to Chengdu, a distance of about 1,000 miles. But when Xi came to the United States, Biden and Xi did not even follow a parallel route to Los Angeles.

We found a clue about what Biden was trying to say when we searched as many transcript archives as we could and found a statement Biden made at a Hillary Clinton campaign event on Nov. 4, 2016: “Because the former president of China and President Obama seven years ago thought we should get to know one another, I traveled 17,000 miles through his country and our country over nine days.”

A White House official conceded that Biden’s line of “traveling with” Xi is not accurate. “This was a reference to the total travel back and forth — both internally in the U.S. and China, and as well as internationally — for meetings they held together,” he said. “Some travel was in parallel, some was separately to joint destinations.”

Try as we could, however, we still could not get the travel to add up to 17,000 miles.

If you take Biden’s 2016 formulation of internal travel in China and the United States, here are the numbers.

The flight distance from Beijing to Chengdu: 950 miles

The round trip drive between Chengdu and Dujiangyan: 100 miles

The flight distance from Washington to Los Angeles: 2,300 miles

That’s only about 3,300 miles. It grows to 5,600 if you decide to add in Biden’s return flight from L.A. That’s still far short of 17,000 miles.

Meanwhile, the flight distance from Washington to Beijing is 6,900 miles, or about 14,000 miles round trip. So adding in Biden’s two trips to see Xi would add 28,000 miles to the total.

The White House did not offer an explanation for how Biden calculated 17,000 miles. But clearly it’s a number he deems important enough to repeat often.

We sought a comment from the Chinese embassy but did not get a response.

The Pinocchio Test

Some readers may object that this is inconsequential. Biden, one might argue, is using the phrase of “traveling together” in a more expansive sense of “flying to meet each other in various places.” Moreover, his broader point is undisputed — that he’s already spent an unusually large amount of time with Xi for someone who is just now taking office.

So Biden’s claim is not completely from whole cloth. He did meet Xi in various cities in China and United States, in some cases traveling substantial distances.

But numbers are numbers. Biden is using a figure that cannot be verified in a misleading way. He correctly notes he spent hours in private talks with Xi, including outside the capital cities, on different occasions. Those are substantial bragging rights — which makes his apparent need to gild the lily with an invented figure so puzzling.

The president earns Three Pinocchios.

Gretchen Whitmer has privately reached out to Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan who are devastated by the war in Gaza, a core Democratic constituency in a state that is key to President Biden’s hopes of returning to the White House. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Whitmer (D) has sought to mend the deep wounds in Michigan’s sizable Arab American community sown by Biden’s full-throated support of Israel. It’s a high-wire act made all the more daunting because the governor is also a chair of Biden’s reelection campaign and is widely perceived to have her own national ambitions.

Ahead of Tuesday’s Democratic presidential primary in the state, Whitmer rejected efforts by an activist group to protest Biden’s Israel policy by urging voters to cast their ballot for “uncommitted.” She actively campaigned to get out the vote for Biden and warned in a statement that “any vote that is not cast, or is cast for a third-party, or cast to ‘send a message’ makes it more likely that there is a Trump presidency.”

Biden won the primary, but “uncommitted” posted an unexpectedly strong early showing as results continued to be counted.

Whitmer is “very well respected in the community, but this issue, the Gaza issue, is becoming an issue against her,” said Sufian Nabhan​, executive director of the Islamic Center of Detroit, who voted “uncommitted” Tuesday.

Whitmer’s outreach to the Arab and Muslim communities is done privately, her allies say, and the governor has been in regular contact with people upset about the war and the Biden administration’s role in it. She has exchanged text messages with Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D), the only Palestinian American in Congress, who represents Dearborn, Mich., the city with the largest Arab American and Muslim population per capita in the nation. Tlaib’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Tlaib’s sister, Layla Elabed, runs Listen to Michigan, the activist group attempting to garner at least 10,000 “uncommitted” votes in the primary (it succeeded).

Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said she’s been in meetings with Whitmer and leaders in the Arab and Muslim American communities since Oct. 7, and that the governor has relayed their grief and anger to the White House.

“I know for a fact the governor has been very direct with the president, the vice president, other people, about how people, how Palestinians in the Arab American community, feel in Michigan, that their families are being killed,” Dingell said. “She represents everyone in Michigan, and she’s trying to do what’s right. And, trust me, you’re in a minefield right now.”

The political tension in Michigan is the latest example of how the conflict in the Middle East has fractured the Democratic Party over Israel’s military response in Gaza following the Hamas-led terrorist massacre in Israel on Oct. 7 that left 1,200 people dead and took some 250 others hostage. Israel launched a retaliatory military campaign in Gaza that has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and displaced close to 2 million, the United Nations reports.

Arab and Muslim Americans, as well as young people and many on the left, have decried Israel’s scorched-earth campaign, including a siege of Gaza in which it has cut off access to most food, water, electricity and other basic goods such as medicine. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans are at risk of starvation and disease.

Whitmer, widely seen as a potential top contender for the White House in 2028, has largely stayed out of the public debate since angering people on both sides of the issue with her early statements. On Oct. 7, the governor wrote on social media that “we need peace in this region,” offending Jewish constituents for not explicitly condemning the attacks or naming Israel. A few days later, she clarified her position, saying, “I’m unequivocally supportive of Israel. And they have a right to defend themselves.”

Soon after, Whitmer attended a large pro-Israel rally in Detroit. Several weeks later, she canceled a preplanned visit to Dearborn after some protested her visit over her support for Israel. At the end of January, Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud said in an interview: “I haven’t heard from Gretchen Whitmer in 110 days. … I think the sentiment that she shared was a very pro-Israeli government sentiment, and we haven’t heard from her since.”

Whitmer and Hammoud finally spoke in early February after the Wall Street Journal ran an opinion piece about Dearborn headlined, “Welcome to Dearborn, America’s Jihad Capital.” Whitmer excoriated the piece, calling it “cruel and ignorant, and a total misrepresentation of an important city.” She also directed the Michigan State Police to reach out to Hammoud to offer the city extra security. Whitmer reached out to Hammoud for the first time after the op-ed, according to a spokesperson for the mayor.

Many in the Arab American and Muslim community say they have been disappointed and felt betrayed by Whitmer for not doing more outreach to their community and for failing to call for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza. In interviews with voters across Dearborn at the end of January, many cited Whitmer’s decision to appear at the pro-Israel rally as one of the main reasons for their dismay at the governor, as well as her failure to appear at any of the state’s many pro-Palestinian rallies where protesters have demanded a cease-fire.

Michigan has become a sort of Rorschach test of how much Biden’s unwavering support of Israel could impact his reelection prospects. The state has the country’s largest population of Arab American and Muslim voters, who overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020. About 300,000 people in the state claim ancestry from the Middle East and North Africa, and more than 200,000 voters identify as Muslim — groups in which there is large overlap. The Arab American and Muslim community has been consumed by Israel’s war in Gaza since October and has mobilized to flex its voting muscle in this year’s election.

Listen to Michigan was solely focused on Tuesday’s primary and has made an energized push for the last three weeks to get as many people as possible to vote “uncommitted” rather than for Biden, aiming to send a warning that Biden’s stance on Israel could cost him the state in November. Biden has few, if any, paths to victory without Michigan. A separate movement, called “Abandon Biden,” supported the uncommitted movement but is also determined to deny the president reelection in November. That group’s leaders have not yet coalesced around a general election strategy — and will not support Donald Trump — but are weighing options such as endorsing a third-party candidate, writing in a candidate or abstaining from the presidential election but still voting in state and local elections.

Leaders from those movements say they have not heard from Whitmer. Elabed said high-ranking Democrats’ continued embrace of Israel “feels like a betrayal, not just of the president that these communities overwhelmingly supported in 2020, but also from the Democratic Party, who is not taking our movement seriously.”

Biden officials have long said they believe voters who disapprove of him now will eventually support him when the presidential contest becomes a head-to-head matchup with Trump. But some Democrats worry that Whitmer and Biden are not doing enough to win back disaffected voters and are disproportionately focused on suburban and swing voters.

The president has studiously avoided interacting with the Arab American and Muslim community since the early weeks of the war. During a visit to Michigan earlier this month, Biden’s team took unusual steps to keep the location of his visit secret in an effort to avoid protesters. Instead, he has dispatched top White House and campaign aides to conduct listening sessions with the community, which campaign officials said they will continue to do for the next several months.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Biden surrogate who has called for a cease-fire, visited Michigan last week to meet with the Arab American and Muslim community.

Khanna has said Democrats must focus on building a modern coalition for the 2024 race and beyond. He is urging Biden and other Democrats to focus on energizing their core base — which includes young voters and people of color — rather than hoping they will support Democrats because Trump and Republicans are worse.

He talks about “two very distinct” theories of electability in the key swing state: one focusing on suburban voters around the issues of democracy and abortion rights, winning back just enough of the Arab American community to nab the state. The other relies on inspiring the base in the same way as Trump — whose voters, he points out, are “going across broken glass to vote for him.”

“I don’t think it’s enough without the inspired base, and I don’t think we get the inspired base without a dramatic change in foreign policy,” Khanna said. “There is deep hurt, there is deep anger, there is deep sense of loss and grief, and there needs to be a fundamental shift in foreign policy as a first step to get back some of the trust. And I think there has to be a healing process after that before you can even start to talk about the electoral case for the president’s reelection.”

Advertisement

Whitmer has largely focused her surrogate pitch for Biden’s reelection on domestic issues, such as reproductive rights, warning that Trump will eliminate those freedoms. But many Arab Americans and Muslims in Michigan wish she was talking more about the conflict overseas.

Michigan co-chair Samraa Luqman of Abandon Biden said it was “absolutely abhorrent and disgusting” that Whitmer had yet to call for a cease-fire.

“As a representative of one of the largest Muslim populations in the entire nation it is a betrayal and it is absolutely something that we will not forget when she tries to run for president,” Luqman said.

A Democratic leader in the Arab American community, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations between Whitmer and those affected by the Gaza war, said Whitmer continues to have a close relationship with the Michigan Arab American and Muslim communities, and that much of her work to cultivate those ties happens behind the scenes.

“The governor has never been the type of person that says things publicly, to brag about certain relationships. But what I can tell you is, she has taken the time to speak to religious leaders [and] to community leaders, including myself,” the Democratic leader said. “It’s really more than just the politics, but to ask how people are doing because she understands that people in her community are going through pain and a hard time. And really, her commitment here speaks louder than some public information that people may be waiting for.”

But another leader in Michigan’s Arab American community who has been critical of Whitmer scoffed at the governor’s efforts.

“If by meeting with the community you mean organizing meetings with people who yell at her and putting on a very practiced and concerned face and claiming you feel their pain, I guess she’s doing that. Meanwhile kids in Gaza are getting blasted to the sky,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about these private meetings.

Nabhan, of the Islamic Center of Detroit, said Whitmer does have strong ties within the community, and that her role as governor insulates her because she does not control foreign policy. Yet he and other Arab American and Muslim leaders are refusing to meet with elected officials, including Whitmer, until they call for a permanent cease-fire.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight One was that “a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family.” Another was that Biden had been inappropriately involved with his son Hunter’s engagement with a Ukrainian energy company. A third was that Biden appeared to be broadly involved in his son’s and brother’s business activities.

At the time, none of these was substantiated. In fact, much of McCarthy’s framing even then was obviously misleading or flatly dishonest. But then, the goal was to investigate these things and perhaps reinforce the allegations.

That is not what has happened.

Last week, the first thread above blew apart in spectacular fashion. The “trusted FBI informant” was indicted on a charge of lying to the FBI in 2020 specifically about the alleged bribe to Joe Biden. The indictment presents extensive evidence both that the informant couldn’t have had the conversations he said he had — conversations that were themselves only secondhand documentation of the alleged bribes — and that the informant was eager to see Biden’s campaign falter. Then it got worse: The informant allegedly has connections to foreign intelligence, including in Russia.

(An aside: It is not alleged that the bribery allegation was a product of interference from foreign intelligence. Instead, the new allegation about those connections points to a different effort to impugn Hunter Biden as being linked back to Russia.)

For months, the House GOP cited an FBI informant to suggest Joe Biden took a bribe as vice president. Now, the Justice Department says that source was lying. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post)

The House Republicans leading the impeachment inquiry, including Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer (Ky.) and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (Ohio), had repeatedly hyped the bribery allegation as a central element of their probe. The implosion left them scrambling and parsing words, with Comer — responsible more than any other person on Capitol Hill for elevating the allegation — telling a Newsmax host Wednesday that the informant himself wasn’t an important part of the investigation.

Jordan, meanwhile, was an unwitting participant in a clip shared widely on social media that same day.

CNN’s Manu Raju pressed Jordan on his representations about the bribery allegation.

“It doesn’t change the four fundamental facts,” Jordan replied, walking through those four facts about the probe.

“You said the 1023 is the most corroborating piece of information you have,” Raju then pressed him, referring to the form documenting the informant’s allegations.

“It corroborates, but it doesn’t change those fundamental facts,” Jordan replied.

“It’s not true!” Raju said.

This seems like a pretty brutal exchange for Jordan, certainly. But only if we gloss over the “four facts” Jordan’s talking about — claims that deal not with the first, bribery-related thread that was blown apart by the indictment of the informant but that instead deal with the second thread, the one about Hunter Biden’s Ukrainian business partners. So the gotcha by Raju isn’t quite what it seemed.

But for all practical purposes, it didn’t matter, since the “four facts” thing Jordan likes to do has also been debunked.

He began using this line last year, that there are “four fundamental facts” that show how Joe Biden acted inappropriately while serving as vice president. We’ve picked this apart previously. The upshot is that it falsely asserts that Joe Biden wanted a Ukrainian official fired to benefit Hunter’s business partner, which has been debunked repeatedly. It also depends on the idea that Joe Biden made a trip to Ukraine after a call from Hunter Biden — a call that probably wasn’t made to Joe Biden and that came days after Biden had already announced the trip.

In other words, Jordan’s efforts to deflect Raju’s questions about the collapse of the bribery claim centered on raising other debunked allegations against Biden.

(Another aside: Technically, McCarthy’s framing of Joe Biden’s purported involvement with Hunter’s Ukrainian partners focused on an email exchange between someone in Biden’s office and a colleague of his son’s, but in an abundance of graciousness we have updated the allegation to match his allies’ current position.)

Then there’s that third thread, this broad argument that Joe Biden has been a quiet/hidden partner with his son and his brother James Biden. Most of the energy that Republicans have invested in the impeachment investigation has centered on finding some proof that Joe Biden benefited from his family’s businesses. The result? They have no more evidence than they did 14 months ago.

Sure, they documented that Hunter Biden leveraged his family name as an income stream. They learned that on some occasions when Joe Biden would call his son, his son would be in meetings with business partners and put him on speakerphone. They learned that both Hunter’s business and James Biden personally had paid Joe Biden thousands of dollars — money that was demonstrably in repayment of loans.

They have also heard from witnesses testifying under penalty of perjury that Biden wasn’t involved in the business. Over and over and over, the same refrain. The most recent person to state that was James Biden himself, testifying behind closed doors on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

“I have had a 50-year career in a variety of business ventures,” he said in his opening statement. “Joe Biden has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest in those activities. None.”

He joins every other interviewed participant in those business activities in rejecting the idea that Joe Biden was involved: Devon Archer, Eric Schwerin, James Gilliar. Even Anthony Bobulinski, who in 2020 joined campaign events for former president Donald Trump, was unable to show any evidence that Biden had been involved in the business.

The important point here is that Republicans are correct when they say that the collapse of the bribery allegation does not by itself derail the entirety of their impeachment probe. In addition to their decision to emphasize that dubious allegation, the probe has also been derailed by their failure to find evidence of wrongdoing. There are discrete elements here that stand alone — or, as the case happens to be, collapse independently.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

His committee and his colleagues on other committees have deposed people in Biden’s family and their orbit, hoping to demonstrate that Biden had done … something that might convince House Republicans to impeach the president.

On Tuesday, the Oversight Committee put forward its case, the product of those months of depositions and, really, efforts that extended back to before Republicans gained control of the House. The social media thread — dropped a day before Biden’s son Hunter appears on Capitol Hill to answer questions — has the aesthetics of a damaging case, with various claims presented and images of highlighted documents offered in support. It also had the desired effect: Elon Musk took a break from sharing right-wing memes to put it in front of his enormous follower base on X.

But neither the aesthetics nor the credulity with which the thread was received made it effective in its actual intent. Instead, it shows that after all of those months of effort, House Republicans still haven’t proved anything of significance.

Let’s walk through each of the 19 posts in the thread to show why.

The thread

1. “Biden Associate Devon Archer testified Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ that Hunter Biden sold around the world when his father was Vice President of the United States.”

Advertisement

The first words here are misleading. Devon Archer was a business partner of Hunter Biden, the president’s son, not of President Biden. Calling him a “Biden associate” is a manifestation of the Republicans’ consistent effort to refer to wrongdoing by the “Biden family” — guilt by association.

This argument manifests another common rhetorical trick the Republicans use: smearing Joe Biden with his son’s — and at other times, brother James’s — efforts to make money off the family name. It has been understood for years that the non-Joe Bidens were making deals based on their last names. If nothing else, the Republican probe has provided lots of examples of how that was demonstrated, the Archer testimony included.

What this post elides, though, is that Archer also confirmed that Hunter Biden had emailed him while they worked together to say the two of them should convince their partners that they’d gotten Joe Biden to act in certain ways even though they had no power to do so. (See p. 115.) In other words, Hunter Biden wanted to demonstrate to his business partners that his last name was worth the money, even though it wasn’t. Archer was also one of numerous witnesses to state under penalty of perjury that Joe Biden was explicitly not involved in their business efforts.

2. “Selling ‘the brand’ has been lucrative for the Bidens. In our third bank records memo, our committee identified over $20 million in payments from foreign sources to the Biden family and their business associates that occurred during Joe Biden’s Vice Presidency.”

Lucrative for the Bidens — meaning Hunter and James. As The Washington Post Fact Checker tallied in August (before the impeachment inquiry began, mind you), members of the Biden family were paid less than $8 million of this total, with Hunter Biden getting the bulk of that money.

Not all of this money came while Biden was vice president, either. See, for example, the deal Hunter Biden made with a Chinese energy company.

3. “Devon Archer testified he was aware of at least 20 times in which then-Vice President Biden spoke on speakerphone with Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates. These phone calls were used to send signals of power, access, and influence to those paying the Bidens.”

“Spoke on speakerphone” is carefully written, since Archer testified that Hunter Biden would generally put his dad on speaker when he’d call. (Archer said the two spoke every day.) Archer also said the conversations were casual, suggesting that they were standard “political” patter from the career politician. (See p. 123.) Yes, Hunter Biden probably hoped to impress those he was sitting with. That’s part of his leveraging his last name.

4. “In a recent interview with Biden family associate Jason Galanis, Hunter Biden put then-Vice President Biden on speakerphone with Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina and her husband, the former mayor of Moscow. VP Biden ended the call by saying, ‘OK then, you be good to my boy.’ ”

The interview with Galanis was conducted in Alabama, as he is in prison after pleading guilty to securities fraud. Whether this call happened as indicated — there is no confirmation that it did — Baturina’s known investments, once tied to Hunter Biden by Comer, actually went to Archer and the businesses he ran. (See p. 138.)

5. “Then-Vice President Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs, as well as a Burisma executive, who collectively funneled millions of dollars to Hunter Biden and his business associates.”

6. “Then-Vice President Biden had coffee with Hunter Biden’s Chinese business associate, Jonathan Li, in Beijing and even wrote a college letter of recommendation for Li’s daughter.”

The letter was mentioned by Archer as an example of the only thing Hunter Biden asked his father to do. (The daughter was not accepted.) The dinner with the Burisma executive was in April 2015, after Hunter Biden was on Burisma’s board. The dinner with the “oligarchs” the previous year included Baturina. Biden “came to dinner, and we ate and kind of talked about the world, I guess, and the weather,” Archer testified.

Advertisement

Both of these posts are meant to imply Joe Biden’s involvement in his son’s business. In each case, Hunter Biden’s ability to deploy his father as an asset is demonstrably constrained: a dinner, a letter.

7. “Hunter Biden’s business associates visited the White House at least 80 times while Joe was Vice President.”

Various people associated with Hunter Biden testified about being invited to White House events like Christmas parties. The report, from Fox News, includes visits that were apparently job interviews and visits from Eric Schwerin, an associate of Hunter Biden’s who also did Joe Biden’s taxes.

8. “Then-Vice President Biden allowed his son to tag along on Air Force 2 to at least 15 countries to sell ‘the brand.’ ”

9. “FOIA’d records show Biden’s VP Office emailed with his son Hunter, his brother Jim, and both of their ‘businesses’ over 29,000 times.”

Advertisement

10. “Then-Vice President Biden used email aliases and private email addresses to communicate with Hunter Biden and Hunter’s business associates hundreds of times.”

Hunter Biden did travel with his father; this happens with presidential family members. So do email exchanges. (Schwerin also worked for Hunter Biden’s business, it’s worth noting.) The idea that the flights were part of “selling the brand” is framing from the Oversight Committee.

The content of the email messages isn’t known. We do know Comer has in the past falsely tried to suggest that a message sent to apparently update Hunter Biden on a family memorial was nefarious. He’s also tried to paint innocuous communication between the administration and Hunter Biden’s associates as suspicious.

11. “Tony Bobulinski also testified Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ being sold by the Biden family as they did work with a Chinese Communist Party linked energy company, CEFC. As part of this deal, CEFC sought to gain a stake in U.S. oil and gas companies to export American made energy to China.”

Advertisement

See the first post.

12. “Bobulinski said that Joe Biden was more than a participant and beneficiary in his family’s business schemes; he was an enabler.”

Bobulinski first alleged impropriety by Joe Biden back in 2020; he went on to participate in campaign events for Donald Trump. His credibility has been repeatedly questioned.

Biden “enabling” his son was described in his testimony the way Archer did: put on phone calls and with Hunter Biden scheming to figure out how to present his father as involved.

13. “The ‘Big Guy’ is 100% Joe Biden according to Bobulinski.”

This is an invocation of a bit of Biden-corruption lore.

In 2017, James Gilliar, an associate of Hunter and James Biden’s, emailed about a business deal, noting that Hunter Biden would get a 20 percent stake. He included a comment: “10 held by H for the big guy?” Bobulinski previously said this was a reference to Joe Biden — but Gilliar has admitted that this was speculation on his part. The eventual deal included no carve-out for Joe Biden.

14. “Joe Biden has interacted with nearly all of Hunters foreign business associates yet continues to lie to the American people about it.”

This is a recapitulation of the claims above.

15. “According to Rob Walker, Joe Biden met with the now-missing Chairman of CEFC, Ye Jianming, and other CEFC officials. This meeting was around the time Hunter Biden and his associates received $3 million from a CEFC entity for the work they did when Joe Biden was Vice President.”

Walker testified that Biden was at the meeting for 10 minutes. (See p. 43.) He suggested — though he admitted he couldn’t say for certain — that Biden stopped by because he happened to be nearby. (See p. 71.) He offered pleasantries, Walker said, but didn’t know what was being discussed.

That the chairman is “now-missing,” of course, is a smoke screen, an effort to make everything seem riddled with suspiciousness.

16. “Our committee subpoenaed and obtained two bank wires revealing Hunter Biden received payments originating from Chinese nationals, including Jonathan Li, in July and August 2019 when Joe Biden was running for President of the United States. Joe Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware home is listed as the beneficiary address for both wires.”

Now we’re getting into the really goofy stuff.

Hunter Biden had his father’s house listed as his home address in this period. The money wasn’t sent to Joe Biden’s house; it was a wire. It went to Hunter Biden’s bank account.

17. “We obtained bank records revealing a $200,000 direct payment from James and Sara Biden to Joe Biden in the form of a personal check. This check was written on the same day James Biden received a $200,000 ‘loan’ from Americore — a financially distressed rural hospital operator which James Biden made ‘representations that his last name, “Biden,” could “open doors.” ’ ”

18. “In an internal Americore document obtained by POLITICO, Jim Biden’s first attribute on his biography is ‘Brother and Campaign Finance Chair of former Vice President Joe Biden.’ ”

That “direct payment” was a repayment of a loan Joe Biden had extended his brother, something that was reinforced by documents reviewed by The Post. The check says “loan repayment” in the memo field. That the money came from a deal James Biden had made by leveraging his last name is irrelevant to the payment.

19. “We released bank records revealing how Joe Biden received $40,000 in China money from the account of his brother, James Biden, and his sister-in-law, Sara Biden, in the form of a personal check. This money landed in Joe Biden’s bank account shortly after Hunter Biden threatened a CEFC associate to pay up — claiming his father was sitting next to him in the room.”

This, too, was a loan repayment, as the check says. It came more than a week after James Biden had received payment as part of a deal made with a Chinese energy company.

There’s no evidence that Joe Biden was sitting with Hunter Biden when the mentioned message was allegedly sent, nor any evidence that — if he was — Joe Biden knew anything about the message being sent. In fact, this claim came to light through a summary of the initial message. It’s not clear if the summary accurately captured the original message.

The Oversight Committee’s thread concludes with a summary of the allegations.

What was left out

Walking through this risks giving the impression that we are trying to stick our thumbs in myriad holes in a crumbling dam. It’s why the thread was presented the way it was, to give the impression that there is a surfeit of evidence against President Biden that cannot be refuted.

But even as this list includes debunked claims, it excludes other allegations that Comer and his allies have made over the past year.

Most notably, it skips the allegation that Joe and Hunter Biden had been bribed by Burisma — an allegation that collapsed when the person who made it was indicted this month. It doesn’t include claims that Hunter Biden and his brother used suspicious “shell companies,” shown by The Fact Checker to be little more than LLCs. Perhaps that’s because Comer had similar corporate entities of his own. It doesn’t include the allegations of another witness, Gal Luft, who had also been indicted by the federal government. It doesn’t include House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan’s (R-Ohio) false claims about Joe Biden leveraging the vice presidency on Hunter Biden’s behalf. It doesn’t include Comer’s attempt to depict a repayment from Hunter Biden to his father as suspicious. It certainly doesn’t point out that numerous people who’d worked with or for Hunter Biden denied under penalty of perjury that Joe Biden had any role in the business.

The posts above are the picked cherries of about 14 months of Republican-led work. The best case they have, then, is that Hunter Biden and his uncle leveraged Joe Biden’s name and their ability to get him to come to dinner or call to reinforce that leverage. No money to Joe Biden; no demonstrated intentional involvement by him at all.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Bartiromo was following up on an allegation that Comer and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had made, that the FBI was in possession of a document detailing an interview with an informant who alleged that President Biden had received a bribe of $5 million from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

“You also spoke with an informant who gave you all of this information,” Bartiromo claimed. “Where is that informant today?”

“Unfortunately, we can’t track down the informant,” Comer replied. “We’re hopeful that the informant is still there.”

The informant wasn’t missing, as Comer’s staff quickly clarified. He was referring to another person making allegations about the Bidens — Gal Luft, who had been indicted by the federal government and was on the run.

Advertisement

The informant, whom Comer had not talked to, was still providing information to the FBI … up until the time that he was arrested on charges that he made up the entire bribery claim.

According to an analysis published by Media Matters on Friday, Bartiromo would amplify the claim more than 200 times before it was finally and thoroughly debunked. This, despite the utter lack of evidence ever presented in support of the allegation.

It is not surprising that Bartiromo would hype an anti-Biden conspiracy theory. Her recent career has been defined both by her sycophantic approach to former president Donald Trump and her elevation of even patently ridiculous assertions. In the wake of the 2020 election, for example, she seized on the idea that rampant fraud had occurred. A Fox executive even noted, in a message unearthed during the lawsuit filed by a company that makes voting machines, that Bartiromo had “GOP conspiracy theorists in her ear and they use her for their message sometimes.”

Advertisement

That pattern has continued well into the Biden administration and perhaps nowhere more than on the bribery allegation.

“Bartiromo’s two programs, Fox Business’ Mornings with Maria and Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, featured references to the now-indicted FBI informant’s claims at least 219 times in 2023, according to a Media Matters review of show transcripts,” the new report reads. “The former, a three-hour weekday program, featured 181 such claims over 62 episodes, while the latter broadcast the remaining 38 claims over 9 episodes.”

Not all of these claims came directly from Bartiromo, obviously, though many did. Media Matters documents some of them:

June 9: “These are the most serious charges ever leveled at a president and the mainstream media will not report it at all.”

July 21: “Explosive new allegations against President Biden. A newly released FBI informant’s file alleges Joe and Hunter Biden coerced a Burisma executive into paying them $5 million each to get [a] Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the company fired.” (This was after Grassley simply released the interview documentation.)

Oct. 4: “A whistleblower testimony that says you accepted $5 million from Burisma executives, as your son did as well, the influence peddling and the charges of bribery against President Joe Biden. We’re not going to let that go off of the front page.”

More often, she played host to Republican legislators who amplified the same allegations. You can see them for yourself at the Internet Archive’s database of cable news clips. The word “alleged” does make some appearances, certainly, but often in the context of breathless assertions about the scale of this alleged corruption.

“FOX News Media has reported on all key developments since the announcement that Alexander Smirnov was charged with lying to the FBI, featuring the story prominently,” a network spokesperson said in statement provided to The Post. “We will continue to report on developments in all aspects of the ongoing investigations, hearings, and trials.”

Media Matters had previously reported that Fox News host Sean Hannity talked about the bribe allegation more than 80 times on his program, amateur numbers compared with Bartiromo. But both played a key role in contributing momentum to the Republican effort to impeach Biden. It was to Bartiromo that Comer offered one of his most dishonest delineations of alleged wrongdoing by Biden, earning no pushback from the Fox host. In December, he boasted to Bartiromo that a new allegation “fits a pattern that we’ve been talking about on your show for months” — a recognition of how important Bartiromo’s platform has been to the Republican efforts.

Hannity, at least, has copped to elevating the unverified story. On his radio show, he told listeners that he should have learned not to trust the FBI after the investigations into Trump. He did not seem concerned about listening to people like Comer who were willing to amplify unverified claims; in fact, Hannity hosted Comer and other Republicans this week for a segment in which they misrepresented testimony from Biden’s son Hunter.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Biden campaign officials and allies noted that the percentage of those who voted uncommitted in Michigan, rather than pulling the lever for Biden, was about 13 percent, not necessarily out of line with past results. And while about 101,000 people voted “uncommitted,” roughly 620,000 voted for Biden, reflecting strong Democratic turnout that they said bodes well for November.

Former president Donald Trump, the leading Republican nominee, faced his own challenges in Michigan, as former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley garnered about 27 percent of the GOP vote Tuesday night. For Trump, far and away the dominant figure in the GOP, that suggested potential trouble ahead, Democrats and Haley supporters contended. Trump has won all of the Republican primary contests so far, but he has often performed worse than polls suggested he would.

Still, some Democrats argued that the sheer number of people who voted “uncommitted” was a flashing warning sign that the president must change course and rebuild trust with key parts of the Democratic Party if he hopes to win the critical swing state in November. Some said privately that they feared the Biden campaign is significantly underestimating the anger among Arab Americans, Muslims, young voters and people of color over the president’s nearly unwavering support for Israel, whose onslaught has devastated Gaza.

“Over 100,000 Democratic voters choosing uncommitted, and 75 percent of Arab American voters doing so, should be a warning that the status quo policies on Gaza are eroding the broad, multiracial, modern Democratic coalition that Obama built,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who is a Biden surrogate but disagrees with his Israel policy.

Khanna added, “I am proud of the president’s win last night and desperately want him reelected. But we need a change of course on Middle East policy.”

The debate among Democrats revolved in part around which voters Biden should be prioritizing. Khanna and other liberal Democrats argued that Biden needs to energize the party’s base and build a multiracial coalition to spur turnout among young voters, people of color and progressives. Others in the party, however, say suburban swing voters are key to victory.

Liberals worry that Biden’s focus on suburban voters, including in Michigan, is now coming at the expense of the base of Democrats who lodged protest votes on Tuesday. Those voters were crucial in propelling Biden to victory in 2020.

Biden officials voice confidence that many disaffected progressives, including those who cast “uncommitted” ballots in Michigan, will ultimately support the president in November, when he is likely to be facing off directly against Trump, a figure loathed by many progressive Democrats.

Larry Cohen, chairman of the liberal group Our Revolution, said that in the days before the primary, his organization had sent 87,000 robocalls recorded by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the only Palestinian American in Congress, asking voters to choose “uncommitted.” About half of the people contacted by phone or text said they would support the effort, he said.

Cohen, a member of the Democratic National Committee who said he would vote for Biden in November, nonetheless took particular issue with the president’s embrace of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right governing coalition.

“Working with elected [officials] and others in the Democratic Party, we are going to continue to push to get a change in U.S. policy, not just because of the politics but because of the morality and necessity of breaking with Netanyahu,” Cohen said. “Even if you are solely focused on Israel, this is not a survival path — supporting a right-wing government that doesn’t pay attention to the rights of Palestinians.”

Leaders and activists in the protest movement, who consider the Michigan results a big win, have now set their sights on Minnesota, which holds its primary March 5 and, like Michigan, has a relatively high percentage of Muslim voters. Democratic leaders in Minnesota, like those in Michigan before them, expressed confidence that Biden would win an overwhelming victory.

“Folks are entitled to vote however they want. We have nine different candidates and options on the ballot next Tuesday,” said Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. “However, as I have traveled around the state, it is clear to me that the party, and the folks who show up at this process, want President Biden to be the nominee.”

Unlike Michigan, Minnesota is not seen as a key swing state by either party, given Democrats’ strength there. But the state’s voters do have a history of being attracted to third-party candidates, which could present a challenge for the Biden campaign.

While the debate was rippling through the Democratic Party, Republicans were anxiously grappling with the Michigan results on their side, especially Trump’s failure to win by as big a margin as some surveys suggested.

Polls this year have accurately shown Trump heading to comfortable victories in each of the first four nomination contests, but they have overestimated his leads by 7.6 percentage points, according to a Washington Post analysis. The overall level of error is about average for presidential primary polls, according to 538.

Still, that overestimate of Trump’s primary margins does not necessarily spell trouble for him in November. In 2016, polls also exaggerated Trump’s support in the primaries, by an average of 4.5 points, and Trump ultimately went on to beat Hillary Clinton.

Haley’s campaign spokeswoman, Olivia Perez-Cubas, framed the Michigan results as a “flashing warning sign for Trump in November.”

And Haley, speaking at a rally in Orem, Utah, on Wednesday, listed Michigan as one of several states where Republicans “are losing” due to Trump.

“We are in a ship with a hole in it. That hole is Donald Trump,” Haley said. “We can ignore the hole all we want, and we’ll go down with the ship. Or we can go and see this for what it is and understand if we go in a new direction that we can save ourselves.”

Trump supporters, however, argued that his performance in Michigan was a sign of strength, not weakness.

“President Trump has received more votes in Michigan tonight than all Democrat primary votes COMBINED,” former congressman Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) wrote on X, in a calculus that appears to exclude the “uncommitted” votes. “It’s possible that the ENTIRE blue wall gets painted red this November.”

Many Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday warned against overstating the impact of the “uncommitted” campaign, but they also signaled it would be dangerous to discount the voices of 101,000 voters in a state where the slimmest of margins could decide the victor. Trump won Michigan in 2016 by about 10,000 votes, while Biden won in 2020 by about 154,000 votes.

“People across this country feel passionately about what’s happening in the Middle East,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), adding that senators have had “frank” conversations with the White House about the conflict. “The humanitarian disaster that has been created by [Netanyahu] in his prosecution of this war has got to stop, and Israel must open up for more humanitarian aid to make it into Gaza.”

Others projected cautious confidence that Biden would do well in November despite the anger over his handling of the Middle East. “Of course I’m worried, but I’m very comfortable and confident that Biden will prevail in Michigan again,” said Barry Goodman, a member of the Democratic National Committee from the state and a Biden donor.

Goodman said Tuesday’s results went as expected and that a significant portion of the electorate that voted for “uncommitted” will vote for Biden in November. Another positive sign for Biden, he said, is Trump’s struggle with some parts of the Republican Party.

“There’s large swaths of the electorate that are not voting for Trump,” he said.

About three weeks ago, activists from a group called Listen to Michigan began organizing their campaign to get as many voters as possible to select “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary. Some activists said Biden must, at a minimum, call for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza before they would consider whether to support him in November.

The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas militants stormed through the Israel-Gaza border fence on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took about 250 others hostage.

In response, Israel launched an attack on Gaza that has killed almost 30,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel’s tactics in the territory have been widely condemned by human rights groups, including its enforcement of a siege that has cut off access to most food, water, electricity and medicine, putting hundreds of thousands of Palestinians at risk of starvation and disease.

Biden in recent weeks has shown more willingness to criticize Israel, calling its military operation in Gaza “over the top,” and he has on a handful of occasions spoken in more detail about Palestinian suffering. But Arab American activists have said this rhetoric is woefully insufficient.

The president said recently that he hoped a weeks-long pause in fighting could come as soon as next week. Such a pause is being negotiated as part of a potential deal that would include the release of Israeli hostages, freedom for Palestinian prisoners — and, U.S. officials hope, a surge of desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza, where the level of aid has decreased over the past several weeks as Israel has allowed far fewer trucks into the enclave.

Biden’s statement after the Tuesday primary thanked “every Michigander who made their voice heard today,” but it did not mention the “uncommitted” votes. Activists from Listen to Michigan said on Wednesday that the statement showed he making little effort to bring the Democratic Party together.

“Biden’s statement last night did not unite this party nor seek to unite this party,” Abbas Alawieh, a Listen to Michigan spokesperson, said at a news conference. “His statement last night ignored the more than 100,000 voters who showed up and asked of him to stand with the children of God, to stand against war crimes, to stand for peace and for a cease-fire.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Biden campaign officials and allies noted that the percentage of those who voted uncommitted in Michigan, rather than pulling the lever for Biden, was about 13 percent, not necessarily out of line with past results. And while about 101,000 people voted “uncommitted,” roughly 620,000 voted for Biden, reflecting strong Democratic turnout that they said bodes well for November.

Former president Donald Trump, the leading Republican nominee, faced his own challenges in Michigan, as former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley garnered about 27 percent of the GOP vote Tuesday night. For Trump, far and away the dominant figure in the GOP, that suggested potential trouble ahead, Democrats and Haley supporters contended. Trump has won all of the Republican primary contests so far, but he has often performed worse than polls suggested he would.

Still, some Democrats argued that the sheer number of people who voted “uncommitted” was a flashing warning sign that the president must change course and rebuild trust with key parts of the Democratic Party if he hopes to win the critical swing state in November. Some said privately that they feared the Biden campaign is significantly underestimating the anger among Arab Americans, Muslims, young voters and people of color over the president’s nearly unwavering support for Israel, whose onslaught has devastated Gaza.

“Over 100,000 Democratic voters choosing uncommitted, and 75 percent of Arab American voters doing so, should be a warning that the status quo policies on Gaza are eroding the broad, multiracial, modern Democratic coalition that Obama built,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who is a Biden surrogate but disagrees with his Israel policy.

Khanna added, “I am proud of the president’s win last night and desperately want him reelected. But we need a change of course on Middle East policy.”

The debate among Democrats revolved in part around which voters Biden should be prioritizing. Khanna and other liberal Democrats argued that Biden needs to energize the party’s base and build a multiracial coalition to spur turnout among young voters, people of color and progressives. Others in the party, however, say suburban swing voters are key to victory.

Liberals worry that Biden’s focus on suburban voters, including in Michigan, is now coming at the expense of the base of Democrats who lodged protest votes on Tuesday. Those voters were crucial in propelling Biden to victory in 2020.

Biden officials voice confidence that many disaffected progressives, including those who cast “uncommitted” ballots in Michigan, will ultimately support the president in November, when he is likely to be facing off directly against Trump, a figure loathed by many progressive Democrats.

Larry Cohen, chairman of the liberal group Our Revolution, said that in the days before the primary, his organization had sent 87,000 robocalls recorded by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the only Palestinian American in Congress, asking voters to choose “uncommitted.” About half of the people contacted by phone or text said they would support the effort, he said.

Cohen, a member of the Democratic National Committee who said he would vote for Biden in November, nonetheless took particular issue with the president’s embrace of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right governing coalition.

“Working with elected [officials] and others in the Democratic Party, we are going to continue to push to get a change in U.S. policy, not just because of the politics but because of the morality and necessity of breaking with Netanyahu,” Cohen said. “Even if you are solely focused on Israel, this is not a survival path — supporting a right-wing government that doesn’t pay attention to the rights of Palestinians.”

Leaders and activists in the protest movement, who consider the Michigan results a big win, have now set their sights on Minnesota, which holds its primary March 5 and, like Michigan, has a relatively high percentage of Muslim voters. Democratic leaders in Minnesota, like those in Michigan before them, expressed confidence that Biden would win an overwhelming victory.

“Folks are entitled to vote however they want. We have nine different candidates and options on the ballot next Tuesday,” said Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. “However, as I have traveled around the state, it is clear to me that the party, and the folks who show up at this process, want President Biden to be the nominee.”

Unlike Michigan, Minnesota is not seen as a key swing state by either party, given Democrats’ strength there. But the state’s voters do have a history of being attracted to third-party candidates, which could present a challenge for the Biden campaign.

While the debate was rippling through the Democratic Party, Republicans were anxiously grappling with the Michigan results on their side, especially Trump’s failure to win by as big a margin as some surveys suggested.

Polls this year have accurately shown Trump heading to comfortable victories in each of the first four nomination contests, but they have overestimated his leads by 7.6 percentage points, according to a Washington Post analysis. The overall level of error is about average for presidential primary polls, according to 538.

Still, that overestimate of Trump’s primary margins does not necessarily spell trouble for him in November. In 2016, polls also exaggerated Trump’s support in the primaries, by an average of 4.5 points, and Trump ultimately went on to beat Hillary Clinton.

Haley’s campaign spokeswoman, Olivia Perez-Cubas, framed the Michigan results as a “flashing warning sign for Trump in November.”

And Haley, speaking at a rally in Orem, Utah, on Wednesday, listed Michigan as one of several states where Republicans “are losing” due to Trump.

“We are in a ship with a hole in it. That hole is Donald Trump,” Haley said. “We can ignore the hole all we want, and we’ll go down with the ship. Or we can go and see this for what it is and understand if we go in a new direction that we can save ourselves.”

Trump supporters, however, argued that his performance in Michigan was a sign of strength, not weakness.

“President Trump has received more votes in Michigan tonight than all Democrat primary votes COMBINED,” former congressman Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) wrote on X, in a calculus that appears to exclude the “uncommitted” votes. “It’s possible that the ENTIRE blue wall gets painted red this November.”

Many Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday warned against overstating the impact of the “uncommitted” campaign, but they also signaled it would be dangerous to discount the voices of 101,000 voters in a state where the slimmest of margins could decide the victor. Trump won Michigan in 2016 by about 10,000 votes, while Biden won in 2020 by about 154,000 votes.

“People across this country feel passionately about what’s happening in the Middle East,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), adding that senators have had “frank” conversations with the White House about the conflict. “The humanitarian disaster that has been created by [Netanyahu] in his prosecution of this war has got to stop, and Israel must open up for more humanitarian aid to make it into Gaza.”

Others projected cautious confidence that Biden would do well in November despite the anger over his handling of the Middle East. “Of course I’m worried, but I’m very comfortable and confident that Biden will prevail in Michigan again,” said Barry Goodman, a member of the Democratic National Committee from the state and a Biden donor.

Goodman said Tuesday’s results went as expected and that a significant portion of the electorate that voted for “uncommitted” will vote for Biden in November. Another positive sign for Biden, he said, is Trump’s struggle with some parts of the Republican Party.

“There’s large swaths of the electorate that are not voting for Trump,” he said.

About three weeks ago, activists from a group called Listen to Michigan began organizing their campaign to get as many voters as possible to select “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary. Some activists said Biden must, at a minimum, call for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza before they would consider whether to support him in November.

The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas militants stormed through the Israel-Gaza border fence on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took about 250 others hostage.

In response, Israel launched an attack on Gaza that has killed almost 30,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel’s tactics in the territory have been widely condemned by human rights groups, including its enforcement of a siege that has cut off access to most food, water, electricity and medicine, putting hundreds of thousands of Palestinians at risk of starvation and disease.

Watters excoriated President Biden for focusing on guns in an address about crime, instead of other things, including “Black fathers.” To focus on military-style weapons, Watters said, ignored that “the issue with Black-on-Black crime is handguns.” But most of his opprobrium was centered on that other group of alleged criminals.

“Now,” he warned, “we’re dealing with migrant crime.”

A month ago, this idea of “migrant crime” was not part of the Fox News patter. In late January, host John Roberts introduced a story about Chicago by asserting that, while dealing with strains because of the arrival of immigrants to the city, there was also another problem: “migrant crime.” But that was an isolated mention. It wasn’t yet a focus of his employer’s coverage.

It has since become one. Over the past month, Fox News hosts, guests and video clips have mentioned “migrant crime” nearly 90 times, more than half of those in the past 10 days. The reason has a little bit to do with a police official in New York City. It has a lot to do with Donald Trump.

At the start of February, the phrase “migrant crime” was picking up a bit in Fox News usage. Host Laura Ingraham, long one of the most fervently right-wing voices on immigration in conservative media, invoked the term more than once, including offering the suggestion that there was a “migrant crime wave” in New York. Fox Business host Larry Kudlow — a veteran of the Trump administration — picked it up as well.

Then, on Feb. 5, New York Mayor Eric Adams hosted a news conference centered on public safety. Adams has for months been at odds with the Biden administration over the increase in immigrants in the city, pressing the federal government for more resources to address the issue. At the news conference, he and his team specifically argued that immigrants were affecting crime in the city.

“In recent months, a wave of migrant crime has washed over our city,” New York Police Commissioner Edward Caban said at the news conference. He was speaking in the wake of an incident in which immigrants had scuffled with police in Times Square, an incident that was in heavy rotation on Fox News and that was later shown not to have unfolded the way police first suggested.

“By no means do the individuals committing these crimes represent the vast number of people coming to New York to build a better life,” Caban continued. But when Fox picked up his remarks in its coverage the following day, that part was snipped out. Instead, they jumped ahead to another part of his comments, where he intoned that these were “essentially ghost criminals: no criminal history, no photos, no cellphone, no social media.”

The New York Times subsequently noted that there has not been an uptick in crime in the city in recent months. In fact, both violent and property crimes are mostly down in 2024 relative to the same point in 2023. But Fox News has never placed the burden of verification on its claims about crime. There are high-profile examples of alleged crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally, so Fox News hosts were happy to elevate Caban’s assertion.

Trump quickly picked up on the idea. Speaking at a National Rifle Association conference earlier this month, he used the term explicitly.

“We call it migrant crime,” he said. “It’s unbelievable what’s going on. And now for the first time, you’re seeing migrant crime. These are tough people.”

Never mind that Trump’s 2015 presidential campaign launch was centered on the idea that immigrants entering the United States were criminals. Trump had picked up on a new political slogan.

It really caught on after he appeared in a one-on-one conversation with Ingraham.

“It’s a new category,” he told Ingraham, who had used the term more than two weeks before. “I don’t know if you’ve heard this, but I came up with this one: migrant crime. There’s ‘crime,’ there’s ‘violent crime,’ there’s ‘migrant crime.’”

“We have a new category of crime,” he continued. “It’s called migrant crime and it’s going to be worse than any other form of crime.”

The day after that interview aired, Fox News used “migrant crime” more than 20 times on-air, including in clips of Trump’s comments. (MSNBC aired it more than a dozen times, in a far more critical context.)

Since then, Fox News has mentioned “migrant crime” on-air every single day. And that’s just in spoken conversation. During a White House event on Wednesday, Fox News superimposed on-screen criticism: “BIDEN IGNORES MIGRANT CRIME DURING REMARKS.”

The political and cultural utility here is obvious. No one wants to appear to be on the side of people committing horrible crimes. Pushing back on exaggerated, baseless claims of rampant illegality opens you up to facile rejoinders about being uninterested in or soft on crime. That makes it easy to allege a crime wave without evidence. Like this one. Beyond high-profile examples of alleged criminality, there’s no evidence that crime is being pushed significantly higher thanks to immigrants — nor, more specifically, is there evidence (as Trump claims) that criminals are intentionally being sent to the United States.

But what’s Jesse Watters going to do? Offer his audience a nuanced assessment of criminality and immigration? Deploy rhetoric that isn’t specifically aimed at tearing down Biden and the left? Probably not.

And what’s Trump going to do? Not use the idea in campaign videos?

“Migrant crime is taking over America,” Trump said in a video posted to social media. He suggested that Biden had allowed an “invasion of our country,” allowing people “into American communities to prey on our people.” He alleged that a “Biden migrant” had committed a murder in Georgia after “Crooked Joe” ordered the immigrant to be released.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

ArrowRight On Capitol Hill, the well seems to have been poisoned after Republicans — particularly in the House — refused to support a bipartisan Senate bill once it became clear that Trump saw potential action on border security as undermining a potent campaign issue for him.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who was among the key negotiators of the failed Senate bill, said he remains willing to negotiate. But the political environment is hardly conducive to progress, Murphy said.

“This is a nightmare,” he said. “You can’t run a country with a House leadership that is this bonkers. We did what they asked. We got a bipartisan border bill. It’s ready to go. But their party rejected it completely. … It’s kind of heartbreaking what this place has come to.”

In early February, most Senate Republicans and a handful of Democrats rejected the border overhaul package that their leaders helped negotiate for months after Republicans in the House said they would never consider such a deal. The rejection of the package came after Trump signaled that Congress should not act on immigration ahead of the November election.

William A. Galston, a fellow in the governance studies program at the Brookings Institution, said the episode shows that no substantive immigration policy is likely to pass in this Congress.

“It would be very, very difficult for anything to happen in this Congress,” Galston said. “Will any significant number of Republicans be willing to buck Donald Trump on this issue, which is his signature issue? There’s no evidence that they will.”

Since the deal fell through, Republicans have insisted that Biden has the power to bring the border under control through executive actions — despite having begrudged actions that Biden has taken without congressional approval.

Democrats, meanwhile, say Republicans are the ones standing in the way of comprehensive immigration reform because it’s not convenient for them politically. Biden does not have enough authority to overhaul the country’s immigration system in a comprehensive fashion, Democrats and even some Republicans insist.

Biden is visiting Brownsville, Tex., on Thursday to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents, other law enforcement personnel and local leaders. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden will talk about “the urgent need to pass the bipartisan proposal that came out of the Senate.”

“He’s going to reiterate to congressional Republicans to stop playing politics, to focus on the American people to get this done, if they are serious … about giving the U.S. Border Patrol agents what they need, if they are serious about fixing the immigration system,” Jean-Pierre said.

Biden’s trip was announced days after news outlets reported Trump will visit Eagle Pass, Tex., about 300 miles northwest of Brownsville. Trump is expected to blast the Biden’s administration’s management of the border — an issue central to his political agenda.

Speaking with reporters after a meeting with Biden this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) insisted that the nation’s “first priority” is border security — and that he personally told Biden that it is up to him, through executive action, to address the issue.

“I believe the president can take executive authority right now today to change that,” Johnson said. “I told him that again today in person, as I’ve said to him many times publicly and privately over the last several weeks. It’s time for action. It is a catastrophe, and it must stop.”

Advertisement

Last week, however, Johnson criticized Biden after news outlets reported that the White House was looking at potential executive actions that could be issued to address the border. In a statement, Johnson dismissed the White House’s efforts as “election year gimmicks.”

Trump is visiting a district held by Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Tex.), who has emerged as a voice in his party for overhauling the immigration system. Like Johnson, Gonzales blames Democrats for the “crisis” at the border, saying they “own responsibility for the failures,” and he argues that Biden can address these failures via executive action.

“You’re the president of the United States, and you’re telling me you can’t secure your own border because you need Congress?” Gonzales said.

Sen. James Lankford (Okla.), the Republican who led Senate negotiations on the failed border deal, said he found it “fascinating” that both Biden and Trump will visit the border in the wake of the bipartisan deal’s demise.

Lankford conceded that Congress is “not able to move anything right now to actually make the difference” on immigration. Still, he said he remains hopeful that Congress will one day pass some immigration reform “because there are gaps in the law.”

Like Johnson, Lankford insisted that there are executive actions Biden can pursue to address some of the issues at the border, but he conceded that Biden’s power is limited and that he does, in fact, need congressional support to secure the border.

“The asylum process is not clearly defined; it does need additional attention and clarity,” he said. “There are additional authorities that are needed. President Trump tried to use some executive authorities that were enjoined in the court. So [Biden] needs additional law.”

Democrats are accusing Republicans of purposely blockading any legislative effort to address what most Americans see as a crisis because it benefits them politically. A Gallup poll released this week found that Americans see immigration, more than any other issue, as the most important problem facing the United States.

Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.), who has introduced several pieces of immigration legislation that would address issues such as temporary work visa shortages, said that Republicans robbed Congress of an opportunity to pass the first significant piece of immigration legislation in decades.

For now, he said, the momentum for change is gone.

“I’m always hopeful and optimistic, but, if I was pragmatic based on the lay of the land in light of the intransigent position of Republicans right now, they have no interest in solving this issue,” Carbajal said. “They’ve been open and vocal about it.”

Murphy is among those who have argued that Biden simply does not have the authority, nor the funding, to manage the border through executive action.

“You cannot hire 3,000 asylum officers through executive order. You cannot stop processing asylum claims by executive action,” he said. “He needs legislation. Republicans know that. Republicans have simply made a decision that they do not want to fix the border because they think the chaos helps them politically.”

In the House, a bipartisan effort is afoot to try to bypass Republican leadership and bring a bill to the floor that would combine border security with foreign aid to Israel and Ukraine. That is being spearheaded by moderate Reps. Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.).

Golden noted that the border provisions in his legislation are narrower than those in the defunct Senate deal and would simply authorize a one-year reinstatement of “Remain in Mexico,” the Trump-era congressionally approved policy that requires that asylum seekers stay outside the United States until they are issued an immigration court date.

Despite support from five Republicans and five Democrats, the effort faces steep odds.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Trump has denied any wrongdoing, seeking to portray the cases as politically motivated.

Saturday’s speech marked a convergence of two of Trump’s campaign strategies for the 2024 presidential race: seeking to turn the tables on Biden when it comes to anti-democracy attacks, and making immigration a central focus. Biden and Democrats have made the future of democracy a key part of their campaign against the former president amid reports and concern from historians that a second Trump term would be more authoritarian than his first.

Trump’s statement Saturday, first made in North Carolina and then reiterated at a rally in Richmond, was the latest in a long pattern of responding to attacks by leveling the same accusations against his opponents. On the third anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Trump attempted to use the term “insurrection” against his political opponents, after he was impeached for the incitement of an insurrection but acquitted in the Senate.

At his rally here, Trump continued to falsely claim that the 2020 election was “rigged.” During the event at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex, his supporters waved signs that said “Too Big to Rig” — an effort to boost turnout ahead of Super Tuesday, when 15 states, including North Carolina, will hold their Republican nominating contests.

During his speech, Trump again portrayed migrants as waging an “invasion” and ramped up his use of the term “migrant crime.” Most of those arrested at the southern border do not have criminal convictions, according to federal data, and experts say that most evidence indicates that undocumented immigrants do not cause more crime.

In Richmond, Trump accused Democrats without evidence of encouraging migrants to enter the country illegally and “trying to sign them up to get them to vote in the next election.” It is against the law for noncitizens to vote in a federal election, and registration of an ineligible voter is a federal crime.

Immigration advocates have accused Trump of deploying racist rhetoric against migrants and say they fear it could inspire violence against the new arrivals. Among the migrants seeking entry at the southern border are record numbers of families traveling with children and underage migrants arriving without their parents.

Trump and Biden made dueling visits to the southern border Thursday. Polls show that the border is a vulnerability for Biden in the November election. Under Biden, the number of people taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol has reached the highest levels in the agency’s 100-year history, averaging 2 million per year.

Trump has often spoken in exaggerated terms to describe migrants seeking to enter the country. In his North Carolina speech, Trump suggested that Biden was bringing in “foreign armies.”

“That’s why a central question in this election is whether the foreign armies Joe Biden has smuggled across our border will be allowed to stay, or whether they’ll be told to get the hell out of here and go back home. We’ll take them back home,” he said to cheers.

Ammar Moussa, a Biden campaign spokesman, responded in a statement: “Once again Trump is projecting in an attempt to distract the American people from the fact he killed the fairest and toughest border security bill in decades because he believed it would help his campaign. Sad.”

During Biden’s border visit to Brownsville, Tex., on Thursday, the president blamed Trump for killing a bipartisan border security deal in the Senate that tied border reforms to Ukraine aid. “Instead of playing politics with this issue, join me — or I’ll join you — in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill,” Biden said. “We can do it together.”

The former president is on a glide path to the Republican nomination, which his campaign expects him to wrap up this month. During his speeches in North Carolina and Virginia, Trump barely mentioned his remaining primary opponent, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley.

Even as Trump touted his string of victories, the campaign events occasionally took on a dark tone. Ahead of Trump’s speech in Richmond, an announcer said: “Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the horribly and unfairly treated Jan. 6 hostages,” before playing the song “Justice for All,” which features the “J6 Prison Choir” as Trump recites the Pledge of Allegiance. Trump has repeatedly used the word “hostages” to describe people charged with violent crimes in the Jan. 6 attack.

During his Richmond speech, Trump described himself as a “political dissident.” At one point, he appeared to mix up Biden and former president Barack Obama as he warned about impending war. Russian President Vladimir Putin “has so little respect for Obama that he’s starting to throw around the nuclear word,” he said.

As he neared the end of his speech, Trump compared his opponents to domestic enemies, reiterating suggestions he’s made that they pose a greater threat than foreign countries.

“We’re taking on some of the most menacing forces and vicious opponents anywhere in the world, and our worst opponents are the people within the country,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight From a distance, the results of Tuesday’s primaries in Michigan are utterly unremarkable: The two candidates gliding toward their parties’ nomination this summer won easily. President Biden and Donald Trump led by a lot nationally and led in primary polling — and then they won, so there you go.

But then, self-appointed augurs that we are, we start looking more closely, digging through the remains of the contest and holding things up to the light. In fairness, many observers, including many in the media, were doing this before the polls closed, announcing loudly what they expected to find in Michigan’s slimy entrails. (This is an augury reference, not a function of my having gone to Ohio State.) That’s what I mean when I say that it’s hard to differentiate between finding something important and the importance of finding something.

One thing that people are seizing upon in Michigan is the fact that 1 in 8 Democratic primary voters opted to vote for “uncommitted” rather than the incumbent president. The organizers of the effort to send a message to Biden — generally about his approach to the war in Gaza — stated that they hoped to get 10,000 people to vote in that way. They ended up getting more than 100,000.

This was a good example of expectation setting (there were nearly 20,000 “uncommitted” votes in the 2016 Democratic contest, for example) and overperforming anyway. But it doesn’t really answer the question of whether this matters for November.

(This is a bit of a cop-out, certainly, since nearly anything that occurs now can safely be assumed to not offer much insight into the general election. But then, that also works the other way: It’s easy to overinterpret things after an election as having offered insights into the results! I digress.)

Biden fared worse across the state than the last incumbent Democratic president had: Barack Obama in 2012. You can see that below, and that he did significantly worse than Obama in counties that voted for him in 2020. (The further a dot from the diagonal line, the bigger the gap between Biden and Obama.)

But the percentage of the vote that was “uncommitted” in each contest was similar. A lot more people came out to vote “uncommitted” in 2024 (101,000 as of writing with just shy of 99 percent of the votes reported vs. about 21,000 in 2012), but a lot more people also came out to vote for Biden than Obama.

The counties where the “uncommitted” percentage was significantly higher for Biden than Obama? Largely those same counties that he won in the 2020 general election.

There were two groups expected to be predisposed to cast “uncommitted” votes in the primary: young people and Arab Americans, both groups that have expressed frustration about Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza.

Post numbers guru Lenny Bronner analyzed precinct data provided by L2, a political data company, finding that precincts in Wayne County with more Muslim Americans (largely determined using computer models) were substantially more likely to vote uncommitted.

Age can be more precisely evaluated and, in that same county, precincts with larger populations of young people cast higher percentages of their votes for “uncommitted.”

The fear among Democrats is less that those voters will support Trump in November than that they simply stay home. Many may — though of course, general elections tend to solidify wavering voters and lots can change before then. It is useful to consider that Biden has more breathing room in Michigan than other swing states; the 101,000 “uncommitted” votes are still tens of thousands of votes fewer than his victory margin in 2020. There are also undoubtedly a lot of Biden skeptics who didn’t turn out for the primary but cast a ballot for him in 2020.

The focus on Biden is heavily a function of this public, state-specific effort to send him a message. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, there’s an ongoing protest vote, mostly manifested in support for former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley’s technically existent challenge to Trump’s bid for the nomination.

In Michigan, that meant that Trump underperformed Biden in nearly every county.

There are probably scores of useful caveats here, including that Trump has an actual organized, well-funded opponent. Biden is also the incumbent president while Trump is not.

Compare Biden’s performance this year with the more recent incumbent primary seeking renomination: Trump in 2020. By that standard, Biden did far worse.

But Republicans circled the wagons around Trump in 2020 (institutionally and generally) in a way that hasn’t happened for Biden this year.

What’s the lesson? Take your pick. You have six charts to pick from.

The most important lesson, certainly, is the most boring one, the one for which no chart is needed: Biden and Trump both won easily and will almost certainly be the two major-party candidates on the ballot in November.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

On Tuesday night, soon after polls closed in much of Michigan, correspondent Dianne Gallagher reported from Ann Arbor in Washtenaw County. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight “I do want to get into some numbers that I just received,” Gallagher told host Jake Tapper. “Of course, these are unofficial, but they have been transmitted from the city of Ann Arbor, Ward 5, Precinct 48.”

“As far as the Democratic Party goes,” she said, “President Joe Biden, 41 votes, Dean Phillips, four, Marianne Williamson, four, and uncommitted received 39. Just a two-vote difference between Joe Biden and uncommitted.”

Tapper had set Gallagher up by asking what she had heard about the uncommitted vote. After she offered the numbers, analyst John King weighed in.

“So it’s interesting,” he said. “This is the math she just said on the Biden, uncommitted … 41, 39, that’s almost a tie, right?”

That did not hold. The 44 percent of the vote that went to “uncommitted” in that one precinct in that one town in that one county was more than three times the final statewide percentage — a percentage that was itself only slightly higher than it had been in 2012, the last time an incumbent Democratic president was seeking renomination. In fact, that 44 percent was well over twice the final percentage in Washtenaw County itself.

During that first hour after polls closed, CNN broadcast four sets of precinct-level results. On average, the reported margins between Biden and “uncommitted” were 36 points off the final statewide margin and 29 points off the final results in the two counties in which they were tallied. The margins between Donald Trump and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley were an average of 20 points off the statewide margin and a whopping 54 points off each county’s results.

Tapper and King each added caveats to their discussion of the early precinct numbers: These were a few hundred votes out of nearly 2 million that would ultimately be cast in the two primaries. But … they still presented the numbers and suggested that some meaning might be divined from them.

It has long been the case that cable news networks — including but not limited to CNN! — have updated viewers throughout the evening as results come in. Those tuning in will be presented with the vote totals that had been counted to that point and large percentages showing who was the beneficiary of the majority of counted votes. Only at the bottom of the screen or with a casual reference by the anchor would viewers then learn that the results they were looking at constituted some small percentage of the anticipated total. There were still many more votes to count, but there were nonetheless large double-digit percentages on-screen showing who was “leading.”

By itself, this idea is deceptive and, as we learned in 2020, potentially dangerous. No one is “leading” in the hours between when polls closed and officials finish counting votes. The election is already over, and someone has won. We just don’t know who.

How you count the votes can give the impression that one candidate or the other is winning — and subsequently that the other candidate is catching up. In the wake of the 2022 midterms, in a similar fit of pique about how vote totals were presented, I created charts showing how the results of the runoff Senate race in Georgia would look depending on how you counted results.

If, for example, you counted the best precincts for Republican Herschel Walker first, it would look like Walker had a huge lead over Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.) that was slowly being eaten away until suddenly Warnock won.

Again, this is not theoretically problematic! In 2020, Trump used his Election Day lead in Pennsylvania to argue that he had won the state — and to portray the slower counting of mail ballots as evidence of a plot to steal the election from him. He had never won Pennsylvania; the vote total when polls closed had more votes for Biden all along. But Trump used the narrative about how vote counting was unfolded to bolster a conspiracy theory that led to the riot at the U.S. Capitol.

A worst-case scenario. But less-nefarious narratives can similarly emerge from misleading vote totals. CNN, like many media outlets, was ready to talk about what the “uncommitted” vote might suggest for Biden’s reelection. The results from that one precinct in Oakland County served as a jumping-off point to do so.

Television news has different demands than print. If nothing’s happening, they still need to show something. And technically, precinct-level results are real results, real tallies of votes. It’s something to show until vote counting is done: the mechanics of how that process works and some updates on it. But there’s no point in reading out those results as though they are indicative of statewide (or even county!) patterns. There’s not even any point in reading out statewide results with, say, 10 percent of votes in; without a sense of where those votes came from and what’s outstanding, that doesn’t tell you much either.

What should have happened Tuesday night is that Haley’s campaign should have seized on another part of Gallagher’s report from Ann Arbor. She interviewed Jenny Rogers, an official in charge of counting votes in the city.

“So on the Republican Party ballot,” Rogers said, “we have 73 votes cast for Nikki Haley, 23 votes for Donald Trump, and one uncommitted.”

That’s 75 percent for Haley!

Asked on Monday when a Gaza cease-fire could start, Biden said: “I hope by the end of the weekend. ... My national security adviser tells me that we’re close — we’re close — we’re not done yet. My hope is by next Monday we’ll have a cease-fire.”

Biden and his top aides have for weeks been almost singularly focused on securing a weeks-long cease-fire in the fighting in Gaza in exchange for the release of many of the more than 100 remaining hostages. The negotiations have proved difficult as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to appease far-right members of his government, who have opposed the deal, and Hamas has made demands that Israel finds unacceptable, including on the issue of releasing Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages.

Nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s nearly five-month-long military campaign, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel launched its retaliatory campaign in Gaza after Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took about 250 others hostage.

If a cease-fire deal is reached, Israel has vowed to continue fighting after it expires, saying it will move ahead with plans to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians are sheltering in decrepit conditions after being told by Israel to evacuate there for safety. Biden and his top aides have made clear they oppose an Israeli military operation in Rafah without a “credible” plan to evacuate the Palestinians there — a task that many experts have said is impossible given the destruction in Gaza and the sheer number of civilians who would need to be relocated.

The White House hopes a temporary pause would lay the groundwork for a permanent end to the fighting. Biden’s tight embrace of Israel, refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire and reluctance to condition military aid to Israel have hurt him politically, as polls show young voters, progressives, people of color, and Muslim and Arab Americans deeply oppose to his handling of the war.

A key test for Biden will come in Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Michigan, where activists are urging Democrats to choose “uncommitted” rather than voting for the president. Organizers of the effort have said they hope that at least 10,000 people will vote uncommitted, sending a message to Biden that he should alter his policy and call for a permanent cease-fire — a step Biden has resisted taking, saying Israel has a right to defend itself by destroying Hamas.

Netanyahu has become increasingly defiant of U.S. demands and has rebuffed Biden’s specific requests, causing a rift between the two leaders. U.S. officials hope that a long-term pause will make it harder to resume fighting on the same scale and that Israel will shift to a more targeted, less deadly military operation.

Earlier in the fighting, about 100 hostages were freed as part of a deal that led to a week-long pause in the fighting. Officials believe that about 130 hostages from Israel now remain in Gaza, including about two dozen who Israeli authorities suspect have died. About a half-dozen of the remaining hostages have American citizenship.

If a multiweek pause in the fighting does materialize, U.S. officials hope it would provide an opportunity to finally end the war, which has provoked global criticism of Israel and the United States. But Netanyahu has said that Israel would resume fighting following such a pause.

Speaking Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Netanyahu said of a hostage deal: “We’re all working on it. We want it, I want it.”

As for whether a deal is close, Netanyahu said: “Hamas started out with just crazy demands. And, you know, it’s too soon to say if they’ve abandoned them, but if they do abandon them and get into what you call the ballpark, they’re not even in the city. They’re in another planet. But if they come down to a reasonable situation, then yes, we’ll have a hostage deal. I hope so.”

Netanyahu also suggested that an incursion into Rafah would be the last phase of the full-scale fighting.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Let's review.  The Washington Post,"“Unlike racist Joe Biden, I have spent my entire life working hand in hand with Black Americans to create jobs, build buildings, invest in our communities and expand opportunities and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color. I built a lot of buildings. I want to tell you, a Black worker is a great worker. You’ve done an incredible job.”

During his presidency, Trump often claimed he had done more for Black Americans than any other president — or, he sometimes might concede, since Abraham Lincoln. Historians scorned his claim. Many cited Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It was Johnson, the historians said, who after Lincoln was the president who made the most lasting impact on the lives of African Americans.

To make his case, Trump would cite achievements like a low Black unemployment rate, increased funding for historically Black colleges and universities (a congressional initiative, not an executive branch one) or passage of an opportunity zone program.

“Trump’s so-called accomplishments will not even be noticed by historians five years from now,” said H.W. Brands, historian at the University of Texas at Austin, in 2020.

Trump recited those claims yet again when he addressed a group of Black conservatives last week, even if the talking points have become woefully out of date.

“We achieved the lowest African American unemployment rate ever recorded,” Trump declared, apparently unaware that Black unemployment under Biden has fallen even further. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate under Trump hit a low of 5.3 percent in August 2019, but had inched up to 6.1 percent before the pandemic struck in March 2020. Under Biden, the Black unemployment rate dipped to as low as 4.8 percent in April 2023; it was 5.3 percent in January.

But rather than fact-check Trump’s golden-oldie material — or his assertion, without evidence, that Biden is a “racist” — Trump’s reference to his career as a real estate builder who supported Black people prompted us to take a walk down memory lane. Trump’s troubled history with Black people was covered when he first ran for president in 2016, but it’s time for a refresher course now that he is seeking the presidency again.

You could begin the story in the 1950s, when Trump’s father, Fred, became the subject of a protest song, “Old Man Trump,” written by one of his tenants, folk singer Woody Guthrie, who objected to the all-White environs of his apartment complex. “I suppose that Old Man Trump knows just how much racial hate he stirred up in that bloodpot of human hearts when he drawed that color line here at his Beach Haven family project … Beach Haven is Trump’s Tower / Where no black folks come to roam,” the lyrics go.

Justice Dept. sues Trump company in 1973

Trump’s first appearance in the New York Times was under the headline “Major Landlord Accused of Antiblack Bias in City.” The front-page article detailed how the Justice Department had brought suit in federal court against Trump and his father, charging them with violating the 1968 Fair Housing Act (another LBJ bill that helped Black people) in the operation of 39 buildings through their Trump Management Corporation. The city Human Rights Commission had tested what would happen if Black and White people tried to rent the same Trump apartments — and discovered White people could easily get a rental but Black people were told nothing was available. A DOJ subpoena revealed that Black applications were marked with a “C,” for “colored.”

Donald Trump, then 27, took the lead in defending the case and told the Times that the charges “are absolutely ridiculous.” He added: “We never have discriminated and we never would.” The Trump Management Corporation turned around and sued the U.S. government right back.

Elyse Goldweber, a Justice Department lawyer who brought the suit, recalled in 2019 that Trump remarked to her during a coffee break: “You know, you don’t want to live with them either.”

Two years later, in 1975, Trump settled the suit without admitting wrongdoing. Under the settlement, the company was required to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week, for two years and advertise in the Amsterdam News, a Black newspaper. Trump spun the defeat as saying he was pleased the settlement did not “compel the Trump organization to accept persons on welfare as tenants unless as qualified as any other tenant.”

In 1978, the Justice Department charged Trump’s organization with being in breach of the agreement by continuing to discriminate against Black people. That case dragged on until 1982, when the original consent decree expired.

When Trump became president, his administration scaled back enforcement of fair housing laws such as the 1968 act.

A nemesis of the ‘Central Park Five’ in 1989

Two weeks after five Black and Latino teenagers were implicated in a brutal attack on a White woman jogging in New York’s Central Park on April 19, 1989, Trump took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for “criminals of every age.” While the ad did not explicitly say the youths should be executed, the implication was clear.

All five initially confessed after long interrogations, but they later recanted their statements, saying they had been coerced by police. The suspects were convicted of violent offenses including assault, robbery, rape, sodomy and attempted murder — and they received sentences that ranged from five to 15 years in prison.

“Everybody, including Donald Trump, rushed to judge us, and therefore it became that much more difficult to be able to mount a really successful fight,” said Yusef Salaam, one of the accused. “And, of course, we lost.”

But in 2002, they were exonerated by DNA evidence. Trump then told the New York Daily News that their $41 million wrongful-conviction settlement was a “disgrace.” He added that “settling doesn’t mean innocence.”

Trump never apologized for his ad. “You have people on both sides of that,” he said after he became president. “They admitted their guilt.”

In November, Salaam was elected to the New York City Council. After his victory, he noted that Trump has been criminally charged in several venues. “I hope he gets treated the way we did not,” Salaam said. “They judged us guilty before we had a fair trial.”

Trump’s true views of Black workers?

Former Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino president John R. O’Donnell, in the 1991 book “Trumped,” alleged that Trump once said that “laziness is a trait in blacks.” He also claimed Trump said of his accountants: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are little short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.”

Trump has called O'Donnell a disgruntled employee, but he has not disputed the remarks. “The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true,” he told Playboy in an interview published in May 1997.

There’s also this Trump observation, from 1989: “A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market … If I were starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I believe they do have an actual advantage.''

Hunter Biden, who appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday before lawmakers and investigators with the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, denied several unsubstantiated claims Republicans have presented as key pieces of evidence in an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. House Republicans have struggled to prove that the president benefited improperly from his family’s businesses, and even some members of their conference have expressed skepticism about the inquiry. The president’s brother, James, testified to lawmakers last week that Joe Biden had no role in any of his business dealings.

Hunter Biden testified that he never introduced or involved his father in his business dealings with a Chinese energy firm he worked with in 2017, defended his tightknit relationship with his father, and unequivocally stated that he never called his father on behalf of his clients.

“All I know is this: My father was never involved in any of my business, ever,” Hunter Biden testified. “Never received a cent from anybody or never benefited in any way. Never took any actions on behalf in any way. And I can absolutely, 100 percent state, that is not just in my case but in every family member’s case.”

During the questioning, when Hunter Biden was pressed on his relationship with Tony Bobulinski, his former business associate, he repeatedly testified that it was Bobulinski, along with another associate, who had proposed involving Joe Biden in their business deal with CEFC China Energy. At the time, Hunter Biden was unaware that Bobulinski and James Gilliar were invoking his family’s name in discussing their possible business arrangement, he testified, but he ultimately ceased his partnership with them once he “lost complete faith in Bobulinski.”

“I did not find him to be credible,” Hunter Biden said about ending his venture with Bobulinski, who has long accused the Bidens of wrongdoing. “I did not find him to be competent. I found him to be arrogant. I found him to often not tell the full truth or the truth at all. And, therefore, I had no faith to have him as a partner in any business.”

The president’s son, however, was less resolute when asked whether his father was present for a luncheon with CEFC officials at a Four Seasons hotel in 2017. Hunter Biden testified that he did not recall the luncheon described by Rob Walker, another one of his business associates who appeared for a closed-door interview before Congress in January. But he added that he did not question Walker’s memory of the event. While Walker described Joe Biden’s presence at the lunch, he testified that the then-former vice president was not involved in any of his and Hunter Biden’s business ventures.

“He spoke nice, you know, normal pleasantries,” Walker said in January of the extent of Joe Biden’s participation in the 2017 meeting. “He, I don’t believe, even really knew why they were there. He specifically said, ‘Good luck in whatever you guys are doing.’ ”

Asked about other dinners his father may have been involved with at Cafe Milano, a see-and-be-seen restaurant in Georgetown, Hunter Biden testified that his dad would often drop by to have dinner with him, as he dined there frequently with friends, family and business associates — or a “combination” of the three.

“He would, you know, stop and have a bowl of spaghetti with me or whoever I was sitting with,” Hunter said of his father’s visits to the restaurant. He did confirm that his father was present for two dinners hosted at Cafe Milano that some potential business partners were also attending but described the appearances as brief and related either to his work with the World Food Program or to his birthday.

Hunter Biden also could not recall dropping off his laptop at a computer repair shop in Wilmington, Del., in April 2019, according to the transcript of the testimony. He has in the past said that he is unsure if the laptop is his and he does not remember dropping it off, but he has conceded that his memory in the depths of what he has admitted was a serious drug addiction was not reliable.

In a lawsuit filed last year against the store owner, the younger Biden acknowledged that some of the data that has been released publicly belongs to him and conceded that the store owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, could have obtained it in April 2019. Responding to questions from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) about the laptop, Hunter Biden testified that if he needed to repair a laptop, he would have normally taken it to an Apple store. His exchanges with Gaetz sharpened after the Florida congressman pressed Hunter Biden about his drug use and addiction.

“Was I an addict? Yes, I was an addict,” Hunter Biden testified. “What does that have to do with whether or not you’re going to go forward with an impeachment of my father other than to simply try to embarrass me?”

At one point he said to Gaetz, “I’ll take you seriously, but it’s hard to do.” Responding to his accusation that his family finances are “interwoven,” Hunter Biden pointed to the reams of financial records the committee had obtained and their lack of evidence tying his father to wrongdoing.

“Do you see a transaction, Mr. Gaetz?” Hunter Biden asked. “It’s not incumbent upon me to point to you to something that doesn’t exist. It’s incumbent upon you to create something, to come up with something based upon the voluminous evidence that you’ve collected, which shows no involvement.”

Despite protestations from his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, that questions about his drug addiction were outside the bounds of the impeachment inquiry, Hunter Biden was asked repeatedly about his substance abuse. During an extended exchange with Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.), he asked why she is being “so hostile” toward him after she queried why an alcoholic with a crack cocaine addiction “would be responsible and considered a professional for handling multimillion-dollar international deals focused on corporate governance.”

“Again, I think that addiction is a very difficult thing to be able to define,” Hunter Biden explained. “I think that there are moments in time where you could be fully competent. I think that there are a lot of people around this room who suffer from alcoholism that are still in this room and that they’re still functioning.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Democratic leaders in the state were bracing for tens of thousands of “uncommitted” votes, as Biden aides and allies sought to tamp down concerns about the strong showing by those aiming to warn the president he could lose the pivotal state in November if he does not change course and push for a cease-fire in Gaza.

With nearly 99 percent of the ballots counted, there were more than 100,000 “uncommitted” votes.

On the Republican side, former president Donald Trump continued his sweep of early primary contests, but former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley appeared poised to garner a significant share of the vote — an indicator of Trump’s own potential vulnerabilities in November’s general election.

In the weeks leading up to the Democratic primary, Arab American and liberal activists launched a concerted push to get Democrats to vote “uncommitted” as a way to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Gaza war, especially his decision not to call for a cease-fire. The group Listen to Michigan declared victory soon after polls closed, noting that it had surpassed its stated goal of 10,000 uncommitted votes.

“Our movement emerged victorious tonight and massively surpassed our expectations,” Layla Elabed, “Listen to Michigan” campaign manager and sister of Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), said in a statement Tuesday. “Tens of thousands of Michigan Democrats, many of whom who voted for Biden in 2020, are uncommitted to his re-election due to the war in Gaza.”

She added: “We don’t want a Trump presidency, but Biden has put [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu ahead of American democracy. We cannot afford to pay the bill for disregarding Palestinian lives should it come due in November.”

Biden campaign officials, however, said the group’s goal of 10,000 votes was artificially low, as 20,000 people have voted uncommitted in each of Michigan’s past three Democratic presidential primaries, even without any organized effort urging them to do so. The president’s allies also cited comments by some of those who threw their support behind the campaign that despite their anger at Biden’s policies, they plan to vote for him in November. A campaign official also noted that there were several “uncommitted” delegates for Barack Obama in 2012, coming from North Carolina, Maryland, Alabama and Kentucky.

Neither Biden nor Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is a co-chair of Biden’s reelection campaign, acknowledged the uncommitted vote in statements Tuesday evening, but they commended all those who voted.

“I want to thank every Michigander who made their voice heard today. Exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy is what makes America great,” Biden said in a statement. He noted that Michigan’s coalition helped send him to the White House four years ago, touted his administration’s accomplishments and laid out the dangers of another Trump presidency.

Michigan is a critical swing state, and Biden’s path to the presidency would be far more difficult, if not impossible, if he loses it in November. Trump won Michigan in 2016 by nearly 11,000 votes. In 2020, Biden won the state by about 154,000 votes.

A Fox News poll in February found that in a Trump-Biden matchup, 47 percent of Michigan’s registered voters said they would support Trump, while 45 percent said they would back Biden.

Even before Tuesday, Democratic leaders had begun to worry about the president’s path to victory in Michigan, which has the country’s largest Arab American and Muslim population, because of deep anger over his unwavering support of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed nearly 30,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took about 240 others hostage. Israel’s tactics in Gaza — including a siege of the enclave that has cut off access to most food, water, electricity and basic necessities such as medicine — have been widely condemned. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are at risk of starvation and disease.

Biden has continued to back Israel’s argument that it has the right to defend itself by destroying Hamas and its deep roots in Gaza. Still, the president has increasingly voiced public discomfort with the Israeli onslaught, saying that it has been “over the top” and that “a lot of innocent people are in trouble and they’re dying.” But such words are seen by many Arab American and liberal activists as woefully insufficient.

Listen to Michigan attracted a spate of high-profile endorsements in the final days before the primary, going beyond the Arab American community and including some of the Democratic Party’s prominent liberals.

Former Michigan lawmaker Andy Levin threw his weight behind the push to vote “uncommitted,” saying he hopes it will show Biden he needs to change course to win the state in November, as did Our Revolution, a successor to the organizing effort behind the presidential bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Other notable Democratic lawmakers, including Tlaib, former presidential contender Beto O’Rourke, and former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, also have backed the movement.

Biden said this week that he hopes Israel and Hamas can agree by Monday to a long-awaited deal that would pause the fighting in Gaza for several weeks, while providing for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. But activists and Arab and Muslim American voters have said Biden must, at a minimum, call for a permanent cease-fire before they can begin to consider whether they will vote for him in November.

Two political protest movements have taken shape in Michigan in recent weeks to protest Biden’s handling of the Gaza war. Listen to Michigan has been focused on the uncommitted vote in the primary. Elabed, the group’s campaign manager, said the goal is to pressure Biden to change his policies and that she is open to supporting him in November if he dramatically changes course.

A second movement, called Abandon Biden, is working to deny the president a second term outright because of his support for Israel’s attack on Gaza and what the movement’s backers describe as a lack of empathy for Palestinian suffering. That group also supported the uncommitted campaign, but its members do not plan to vote for Biden in the fall.

Biden campaign officials said the number of uncommitted votes in Michigan will not change their general election strategy because they are not taking any votes for granted. The president has dispatched top aides in recent weeks to meet with members of the Arab American and Muslim communities and to conduct listening sessions, and campaign officials said those meetings will continue over the next several months.

But organizers hope their showing in Michigan will lend momentum to similar movements that have begun to arise in other Democratic primary states.

Trump did not travel to Michigan on Tuesday for the primary, though he held a rally there earlier this month. Trump also traveled to the state last fall, amid a strike by the United Auto Workers, to argue that he represents the interests of blue-collar workers far more than Biden does. (Biden walked a picket line in support of the strike, and the UAW endorsed him in January, though it is not clear if the union’s rank-and-file members will embrace the president.)

In remarks to the Michigan GOP, Trump said Tuesday night’s “numbers are far greater than we even anticipated” and thanked former ambassador and congressman Pete Hoekstra, who the Republican National Committee has recognized as the Michigan GOP chairman. Trump did not mention Haley.

“We have to win on November 5, and we’re going to win big, and it’s going to be like nothing that anybody has ever seen. It’s going to be fantastic,” Trump said, according to a transcript provided by his campaign.

Haley’s campaign, meanwhile, said Tuesday night’s results were a “flashing warning sign for Trump in November.” With nearly 99 percent of the ballots counted, she had nearly 27 percent of the vote.

“Let this serve as another warning sign that what has happened in Michigan will continue to play out across the country,” campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said.

The Michigan Republican Party has been engulfed in turmoil in recent months, and while Tuesday’s primary was relatively straightforward for the Democrats, its role in selecting delegates to the Republican National Convention is complicated.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Why the controversial ‘Baby Olivia’ video could air in more schools

A controversial fetal development video created by an antiabortion group is making its way into American classrooms.

North Dakota led the way last year by mandating the showing of Live Action’s “Baby Olivia” or a similar presentation, and states such as Iowa, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri are considering similar measures.

Live Action, a nonprofit group that opposes abortion in all cases, has said it wants “Baby Olivia” shown to students nationwide. Its leaders have played the animation to legislative audiences, including during a side session at a conference held last year by the influential conservative American Legislative Exchange Council.

Legislative backers say the mandate aims to ensure students understand human development. They deny it is political, though some told The Post that changing minds about abortion would be a welcome byproduct.

The flurry of bills worries some abortion rights advocates, who fear they could be a part of an emerging strategy to influence abortion views.

“It’s important people pay attention here,” said Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States. “These cookie cutter bills should be chilling for folks to think about nationally.”

‘Meet Baby Olivia’

Live Action came into the spotlight in 2011, when it released undercover videos seeking to discredit Planned Parenthood; within a decade, Live Action was reporting a yearly revenue of $14 million.

In 2021, the group’s leaders showed off their new project: a lifelike, detailed timeline of each stage of human development. The group worked with animators on “Baby Olivia,” touting doctors who it said endorsed its validity. The result was the “best in class window to the womb,” founder Lila Rose said in an interview.

But medical experts who reviewed the video said they found it problematic.

A closer look: The video asserts that a “new human being has come into existence” at the moment of fertilization and that three weeks and one day later, a heartbeat can be detected. It goes on to say that 11 weeks after fertilization, “Olivia” is “playing” and “exploring her environment” and that 20 weeks after fertilization, some babies have survived outside the womb.

Louise King, an OB/GYN and director of reproductive bioethics at Harvard Medical School’s Center for Bioethics, said there is no scientific consensus on the exact moment a human life begins and the video is an attempt to advance the idea that fetuses are people and abortions are morally wrong.

The fate of the “Baby Olivia” bills, all sponsored by abortion restriction proponents, is uncertain. West Virginia and Iowa have seen some progress, while Kentucky and Missouri have yet to move forward.

Meanwhile, in South Dakota …

Lawmakers want the state health department to create an educational video to explain the exception to the state’s strict abortion ban, Arielle Zionts of KFF Health News reports.

Key context: South Dakota permits abortion only when necessary to save the life of the pregnant patient. Violating the state’s ban can be punished with two years in prison.

The film — if okayed by lawmakers — would walk through how state law defines abortion and discuss treating conditions that can threaten the life or health of a pregnant person.

Bill sponsor Taylor Rehfeldt, a Republican state representative and nurse anesthetist, said she introduced the legislation after hearing from health-care providers.

“It's important that we provide that clarification because we all want moms to be taken care of,” said Rehfeldt, who is against abortion in most cases.

Amy Kelley, an obstetrician and gynecologist in Sioux Falls, said she appreciates the intent of the video but doesn’t think it would ease concerns about potential repercussions. “It's really hard to turn medical care into a cookbook because people do not follow the book,” said Kelley, whose practice includes patients with high-risk pregnancies.

On the Hill

Congressional leaders agree to delay government shutdown deadlines

Congressional leaders clinched a funding deal yesterday that would prevent a partial government shutdown at midnight on Friday, as lawmakers iron out the final details of a $1.7 trillion spending package, The Post’s Jacob Bogage and Marianna Sotomayor report.

Under the agreement, funding for roughly 20 percent of the federal government would expire a week later than planned, on March 8. Funding for the rest of the government, including the Department of Health and Human Services, would be extended until March 22.

The House could vote as soon as today on the short-term extension.

On our radar: The leaders said negotiators have already reached agreements on six full-year spending bills, including for the Food and Drug Administration. The remaining six bills are expected to be finalized before March 22.

Meanwhile, in the Senate …

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), chair of the chamber’s antiabortion caucus, swiftly blocked passage of a bill yesterday that would codify access to in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments nationwide.

Hyde-Smith deemed the bill a “vast overreach” and rejected Sen. Tammy Duckworth’s (D-Ill.) unanimous consent request.

On our radar: Duckworth previously said she would seek a roll-call vote to compel Republicans to take a public stance on the issue, following the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are people.

Agency alert

CDC says older adults should get second coronavirus shot

The CDC recommended yesterday that people over 65 get a second dose of the coronavirus vaccine because they are at higher risk for severe disease, our colleague ​​Lena H. Sun reports.

CDC Director Mandy Cohen endorsed the recommendation shortly after the agency’s vaccine advisory committee voted 11-1, with one abstention, for the move. Eligible individuals should be able to receive the second dose at pharmacies within days.

The advisory committee’s vote appeared to take some of its members by surprise. Several panelists had suggested softer language that would have said older adults “may” get a second dose instead of “should,” citing growing vaccine hesitancy.

Biden’s doctor declares him ‘fit’ and able to carry out his duties

President Biden’s doctor said he “continues to be fit for duty” following an annual checkup yesterday in which he declared no major new concerns, The Post’s Matt Viser reports.

The exam found Biden, at 6 feet and 178 pounds, in good shape physically and said he “fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.” The report didn’t include a cognitive fitness assessment.

The bigger picture: The six-page memo was released at a time when Biden’s age and cognitive abilities have been under scrutiny as the nation’s oldest president runs for reelection. The 81-year-old incumbent, who would be 86 at the end of a second term, is likely to face Donald Trump, who is 77.

New this a.m.: Despite Michigan voters approving recreational marijuana six years ago, no trials have begun as required by law to use cannabis tax revenue for research on its health benefits for veterans, our colleagues David Ovalle and Fenit Nirappil report.

Critics blame federal restrictions on marijuana research. The Food and Drug Administration blocked one study into post-traumatic stress disorder, deeming inhaling marijuana too risky. Another trial waited nearly two years to secure a federally approved marijuana supply for study, because the law bars researchers from using weed widely available at dispensaries.

The delays in Michigan highlight challenges in studying marijuana’s health effects in the United States, where federal law deems it illegal even as most states allow its use. Scientists hope for faster research with relaxed federal restrictions , but fear ongoing skepticism and legal barriers will hinder studies, despite millions already using marijuana for medical purposes.

What began with then-President Trump’s attempts to leverage Zelensky for political gain over Joe Biden in the 2020 election — the thing Trump was initially impeached for — has more recently involved candidate Trump’s efforts to kill two attempts at funding Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion.

Through much of it, Zelensky has been mostly diplomatic toward the former and potentially future president who, regardless of the 2024 election results, holds considerable sway over the survival of Zelensky’s country.

But increasingly, Zelensky has apparently decided that diplomacy involves putting pressure on and, in some cases, directly criticizing Trump.

In a CNN interview that aired Monday, Zelensky was asked about Trump declining to say last year whether he was on Ukraine’s or Russia’s side. He repeatedly entertained the idea that Trump might effectively be on Russia’s side.

“Putin killed all the values which we defend today,” Zelensky said, adding: “That’s why I can’t understand how Donald Trump can be on the side of Putin. So, for me, it’s something unbelievable.”

Zelensky didn’t seem to be actually accusing Trump of being on Putin’s side — the interview was in English and the language barrier seems to loom here — but he repeatedly held it out as the potential practical extent of Trump’s posture.

“So if Donald Trump doesn’t know whom he will support, Ukraine or Russia, I think that he will have challenges with his society, because to support Russia, it means be against Americans,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky downplayed Trump’s recent comments, when he said he would advise Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries who don’t meet spending targets. Zelensky said this was “just words.” But he also suggested that Trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when he says he could quickly end the Russia-Ukraine war.

“He can’t solve it with Putin and with Russia, because we will never be ready to give our territory just for the stopping of the war, give them sort of a sense of our country,” Zelensky said. “I think he doesn’t really understand that Putin will not stop. … He wants to occupy us totally. That’s why I think that Donald Trump doesn’t know Putin.”

Zelensky added: “He never fought with Putin. American army never fought with the army of Russia. Never.”

The comments build on a series of blunt comments from Zelensky since last summer:

In July , he suggested Trump’s claim to being able to end the war in 24 hours was fanciful. He noted the conflict between the countries had been roiling for some time. “It looks as if Donald Trump had already these 24 hours once in his time. … He had that time at his disposal, but he must have had some other priorities.”

In November , Zelensky again dinged the 24 hours claim, saying, “If he can come here, I will need 24 minutes … to explain [to] President Trump that he can’t manage this war” in that time frame.

And last month , Zelensky called Trump’s 24 hours claim “very dangerous.” He suggested Trump might try to unilaterally make decisions about a resolution without Ukraine’s input, saying it “makes me really quite stressed.” He added: “Because even if his idea [for ending the war] — that no one has heard yet — doesn’t work for us, for our people, he will do anything to implement his idea anyway. And this worries me a little.”

The new comments come as Congress has struggled mightily to come up with a deal that would fund Ukraine — something about half of House Republicans have balked at but Congress has overwhelmingly voted in favor of — and as Trump has loomed over that process.

First came a bipartisan deal that coupled Ukraine funding with border security — and Republicans abruptly backed off the deal in the face of Trump’s opposition.

Now Trump’s opposition to a stand-alone foreign-aid package that includes Ukraine funding could kill that effort, too. Despite the bill getting 70 votes in the Senate, Trump has opposed it, and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has balked at giving it a vote even as it would almost definitely pass. (A sign of how Trump’s opposition there matters: Longtime Russia hawk and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham cited Trump’s opposition in casting a shocking vote against the bill.)

Zelensky has in the past treated Trump gently, including kind of vouching for him in the matter of the phone call that touched off Trump’s first impeachment. He’s done so despite Trump’s often soft approach to Russia.

The comments are particularly notable given Trump hasn’t expressly ruled out new Ukraine funding; he’s instead pitched the idea of a loan.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Why the Illinois governor is thinking ‘big’ on reproductive rights

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) is intensifying his focus on reproductive rights in the lead-up to the November elections.

The billionaire scion of the Hyatt hotel empire, through his nonprofit Think Big America, is funneling money and resources into ballot measure campaigns aimed at enshrining abortion rights in Nevada and Arizona. The group is exploring opportunities to support similar initiatives in battleground states like Montana.

I recently chatted with Pritzker about the effort and why he decided to flex his political and financial muscles on the national stage. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

H202: Your supporters have described abortion rights as an issue that seems personal to you. Does that sentiment hold up?

Pritzker: The truth is, I came to this subject very early in my life because my mother was an activist in the ‘70s and ’80s who cared very deeply about women’s rights.

After my father passed away in 1972, I was about 7. And so you know, [my mother] didn't want to leave me alone at home. So there I was, in meetings, at rallies and so on for years really watching her listening to the passions of people who care deeply about their personal freedom.

She also passed away when I was young at 17. Now, especially when these rights are under attack, I feel her with me and I feel like I can’t let her down. That’s my kind of impetus.

Advertisement

H202: You expanded protections for reproductive rights in Illinois as governor, but with Think Big America, you are enhancing your national profile. What inspired that decision to take this effort over state lines?

Pritzker: We’ve turned Illinois into an oasis for women who were refugees from states that cut off their rights, but that’s not sustainable. It divides the country. The truth is, a strong majority of Americans want to protect their individual rights, and reproductive rights are among the freedoms people feel most strongly about. So that led me to understand that I needed to get involved in every opportunity where we could really make a difference.

H202: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) has urged President Biden to speak out about abortion more. Do you think that would help Democrats in the run-up to November?

Advertisement

Pritzker: Gretchen Whitmer is right. There is no voice more important than the president of the United States speaking out for abortion rights — and by the way, I don’t think he’s reluctant to do so, I just think that it hasn’t been the focus of his efforts.

Approximately two years ago when President Biden came to Illinois, I rode with him to the event site and talked to him about how important it is for his personal voice to be heard. I think it’s not only good for his reelection, but it's important for the confidence of women who are under attack, to know that the most powerful position and person in the political sphere in this country is their advocate.

H202: Was Biden receptive to your feedback during the conversation?

Pritzker: Absolutely. Believe me, having [Vice President] Harris out there talking about this issue consistently is hugely important. But the president reacted very well to it and has since spoken out in the fight to protect women’s reproductive rights.

Advertisement

H202: You’ve dismissed questions about presidential aspirations this election cycle. Is a White House bid on the table for you in the future?

Pritzker: I love the job that I have. I’m flattered, of course, that my name gets brought up. I think there are some terrific leaders in the Democratic Party and we’re in a great position for 2028 to win the presidency. But I honestly think once Joe Biden wins in 2024, we’ll all be focused on governing for a while.

Daybook

On tap today: Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra is heading to Alabama to speak with patients and doctors about the controversial court ruling that has cast uncertainty over the future of in vitro fertilization in the state.

Becerra’s visit comes exactly one week before Super Tuesday, and it underscores the Biden administration’s focus on the ruling as additional proof of a Republican-led attack on reproductive health care.

Congressional PBM reform, site-neutral proposals tabled for now

Congressional leaders are dialing back their health-care policy ambitions for an upcoming government funding package.

The details: Legislation for the March 8 government funding deadline will likely include only a handful of provisions with pressing deadlines , including expiring health programs that fund safety-net hospitals and community health centers, according to Axios’s Peter Sullivan and Victoria Knight.

Yes, but: These policies might not be off the table for good. By punting virtually all current considerations, Congress could attempt to pass a health-care package during a lame duck session.

Whether the chambers can reconcile their competing priorities remains to be seen. In the meantime, we’ll keep an eye on the rift between House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Senate health committee ranking member Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) over whether PBM reforms should apply to the commercial market and not just Medicare.

Florida lawmakers postpone ‘fetal personhood’ bill after Alabama IVF ruling

Republican lawmakers in Florida are pumping the brakes on a bill that would have given any “unborn child” new protections in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are people, The Post’s ​​Lori Rozsa reports.

Advertisement

The legislation had passed easily through most committees in the GOP-led legislature until Democrats began raising concerns last week that the proposal was so broad it might also affect in vitro fertilization treatments. A hearing for the Senate companion bill has since been pulled off the calendar, meaning lawmakers are unlikely to revisit the issue before the legislative session ends on March 8.

A closer look: The bill sought to define a fetus as an “unborn child” shielded by civil negligence laws. Supporters said the measure would bring civil law in line with existing state criminal law that allows for additional penalties against people charged with harming a pregnant woman.

Opponents called it an effort to establish “fetal personhood” that would put providers and people who help women obtain an abortion at risk of being sued. Lawmakers on both sides of the proposal acknowledged that the Alabama ruling helped quash it.

But perhaps the most illustrative shift in Americans’ border politics concerns the signature proposal of Biden’s predecessor: the border wall. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight As border crossings and concern about the border both reach record highs, the wall is suddenly more popular than ever, it seems.

Multiple recent polls have shown support for building a wall along the southern border cresting a majority.

Late last year, it was Quinnipiac University and Fox News polling that showed between 52 and 57 percent supported its construction. On Monday, it was a Monmouth University poll that pegged support at 53 percent.

This comes after the support for the wall was mostly mired in the 30s during Donald Trump’s presidency, as Trump famously pushed for the wall and even shut down the government over it.

Advertisement

It’s likely that Trump’s presidency actually depressed support for the wall, since many people associated it with his unpopular brand. (It dipped in popularity during his presidency and was somewhat more popular before.)

What seems to have happened is that Trump being out of office has combined with record migrant encounters at the border and levels of concern about the situation — a two-decade-high 55 percent labeled illegal immigration a “critical threat” in a Gallup poll released Tuesday — to push support to new highs.

Each of the above polls show support for the wall higher than at any point since Trump launched his 2016 campaign. Quinnipiac showed support dropping to 47 percent last month, but even that was higher than at any point before last fall.

The numbers are also apparently unprecedented across other polls even before Trump’s foray into politics.

Advertisement

The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research’s archive features polling on the border wall (or a border fence) dating back to the early 1990s. The very first polls, in 1993, showed support shy of 30 percent, with two-thirds of Americans opposed.

Polling between then and when Trump took office was infrequent. It usually showed support in the 40s, but one poll — Fox News’s — showed support occasionally hitting 50 percent or more. It appears to have been the only poll to do so. And its previous high was 53 percent (in 2010) — just shy of the 57 percent it showed in October and the 54 percent in December.

The shift since Trump’s term is particularly pronounced when you drill down on independents.

At the wall’s low point in September 2017, Monmouth showed independents opposed it, 59 percent to 35 percent. Those numbers have now flipped, with independents backing it 58-40.

The rise in support for the wall also comes despite many Americans having said they didn’t think it would be particularly useful.

Quinnipiac data in 2019 showed Americans said 64-33 that the wall wouldn’t significantly reduce violent crime and 60-37 that it wouldn’t significantly reduce the flow of illegal drugs. Pew Research Center data during Trump’s term showed only about 3 in 10 Americans thought the wall would result in a “major” reduction in illegal immigration.

And it’s not clear that Americans have suddenly been convinced it would do a ton of good. Even last month, Pew data showed just 41 percent thought significantly expanding the wall would make the situation at the border better. More thought it would not make much difference (32 percent) or even make it worse (14 percent).","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight North Dakota last year became the first state to pass such a bill, after a state senator opposed to abortion showed the three-minute video during a committee hearing. Similar legislation passed major legislative hurdles this week in Iowa and West Virginia, and bills have also been filed in Kentucky and Missouri. Although the details vary, each of the bills references “Baby Olivia,” a video that Live Action debuted in 2021 “to reveal the undeniable humanity of preborn children.”

The nonprofit group, which is against abortion in all cases, including those involving rape or incest, has said it wants “Baby Olivia” shown to students across the nation. Its leaders have played the animation to legislative audiences, such as during a side session at a conference held last year by the influential conservative American Legislative Exchange Council.

Advertisement

After the North Dakota law passed, Live Action founder Lila Rose described it as “just the beginning.”

“When people learn the truth about the humanity of children in the womb, and the barbaric procedures abortionists use to kill them, they change,” she said at the time, using inflammatory language embraced by some hard-liners in the antiabortion movement. “They become pro-life.”

Medical experts say the video is misleading because it mischaracterizes how soon fetuses exhibit certain traits and uses a timeline for pregnancy two weeks earlier than is typical. Democrats call it propaganda aimed at persuading children to oppose abortion.

The flurry of “Baby Olivia” bills comes as the classroom continues to be a major battleground in the nation’s culture wars, with legislators seeking to control what students learn and how they learn it, in this case taking on the charged issue of when life begins. For Republicans, their position on reproductive rights is a challenge heading into the November election — a point highlighted by the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision that imperiled in vitro fertilization.

Advertisement

The states pursuing the legislation have all sought to restrict abortion since the fall of Roe v. Wade. Iowa, where House lawmakers passed the bill Wednesday, has a six-week ban that is still being contested in court. In West Virginia, where the state Senate passed the bill Tuesday, a near-total ban is in place. North Dakota, Kentucky and Missouri also have banned or mostly banned the procedure.

Legislative backers in those states say the bills merely aim to ensure students understand human development, framing the video as a biology lesson. They deny that it is political and say it shouldn’t be controversial, though some told The Washington Post that changing minds about abortion would be a welcome byproduct.

“If the outcome of this is we have less pregnancies from children, or less abortions, isn’t that a good thing?” said state Rep. Luana Stoltenberg (R), the sponsor of the Iowa bill.

Advertisement

The bills, some of which have stalled in committee, have been concerning to abortion rights advocates, who fear the legislation could be a part of an emerging strategy to influence abortion views.

“It’s important people pay attention here,” said Ruth Richardson, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood North Central States. “These cookie-cutter bills should be chilling for folks to think about nationally.”

‘Meet Baby Olivia’

Live Action came into the spotlight in 2011, when it released undercover videos seeking to discredit Planned Parenthood, and within a decade was reporting a yearly revenue of nearly $14 million. In recent years, Rose told The Post, the group embarked on a new project: developing a lifelike, detailed timeline of each stage of human development.

The group worked with animators on “Baby Olivia,” touting doctors who it said reviewed and endorsed its validity. The result was the “best-in-class window to the womb,” Rose said in an interview.

Advertisement

When the video was released, Rose said that “baby Olivia is at the core of the abortion debate.”

“Will we defend her? Will we defend her constitutionally protected right to life?” she said in a news release. “Baby Olivia should be shown to anyone considering abortion — in schools, at pregnancy resource centers, at churches, and in sidewalk advocacy.”

The pink-lit, ultrasound-like animation, hosted on a website that declares, “Meet Baby Olivia,” shows a fetus that Live Action named Olivia progressing in utero from a fertilized egg to a fetus near birth.

The video makes assertions that medical experts challenge. It starts by saying that a “new human being has come into existence” at the moment of fertilization — which some medical experts and abortion rights advocates contested is religious ideology — and that three weeks and one day later, a heartbeat can be detected. It goes on to say that 11 weeks after fertilization, “Olivia” is “playing” and “exploring her environment,” and that 20 weeks after fertilization, some babies have survived outside the womb.

At the end, the narrator says, “She will soon signal to her mother that it is time for delivery, and greet the outside world.”

Live Action said it worked with six medical professionals to create the animation. Most are affiliated with right-leaning, Christian or pro-life groups, including the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Pediatricians, a small group of conservative doctors that has tried to shape policies on abortion by promoting views rejected by the medical establishment as scientific fact.

Other medical experts who reviewed the video said they found it problematic. Louise King, an OB/GYN and director of reproductive bioethics at Harvard Medical School’s Center for Bioethics, said that there is no scientific consensus on the exact moment a human life begins, and that the video is an attempt to advance the idea that fetuses are people and abortions are morally wrong.

Advertisement

“Having legislatures force schools to show these videos that are potentially misleading in a scientific fashion is in my opinion inappropriate,” King said.

Much of the controversy over the video centers on the timeline it uses. Doctors typically count weeks of pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual period, an approach that is favored because it’s difficult to know exactly when fertilization or implantation occurs, according to Sonia Suter, a law professor who co-directs George Washington University’s Health Law Initiative.

The Live Action video counts from weeks “after fertilization”; as a result, it shows milestones occurring two weeks earlier, which Suter said is not technically wrong but is potentially confusing. The bioethicist said the two-week difference can be significant if “these markers are morally significant to you. You might think it’s two weeks earlier than what everyone else is talking about.”

Advertisement

Michael Belmonte, an OB/GYN and fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, said much of the public understands the pregnancy timeline as beginning from the last menstrual period, making the video’s timeline “misleading.”

He said the video also mischaracterizes how early survival outside the womb is possible, saying that it’s rare and requires significant intervention at 20 weeks after fertilization. The video’s “heartbeat” mentions are also problematic, he said, because the heart would not yet be developed at the point that Live Action claims. He noted that the video uses the sound of a fully developed heartbeat, rather than the electrical impulses that would actually be heard.

“I think this is part of a larger movement to instill antiabortion sentiment by manipulating people’s emotions rather than truly sharing science-based facts,” Belmonte said.

Medical experts and abortion rights advocates also took issue with Live Action naming the fetus and describing movements that are learned after birth, like playing, claiming that in doing so, the video is attempting to convince students that abortion means ending human life.

As legislation emerged requiring the video or one like it be shown in schools and some OB/GYNs disputed its claims, Live Action defended its validity. A recent news release claimed media outlets were “attempting to delegitimize it,” citing the Mayo Clinic, the journal Nature and WebMD in describing it as medically accurate.

“Live Action’s Baby Olivia is backed by multiple scientific sources spanning decades of research,” the release reads.

The legislative push

After Roe was overturned, North Dakota state Sen. Janne Myrdal (R) helped lead her state’s effort to outlaw nearly all abortions. While preparing for last year’s legislative session, she found the animation.

Soon, she was showing it to fellow lawmakers. She presented it as a model video during a committee hearing, proposing that it or a similar animation be used in classrooms.

“If someone sees the beauty of human development, and that gives them a second thought, that’s great,” she said in an interview. “I think what’s offensive is the other side doesn’t want to show the truth.”

It is unclear why the bills are coming up now, three years after the video’s release. However, Live Action confirmed to The Post that they showed “Baby Olivia” at two conferences in 2023. One was a gathering the group hosts for fewer than 100 state lawmakers, aides to governors and other state officials; the other was a side session at a summit organized by the American Legislative Exchange Council.

West Virginia state Sen. Patricia Rucker (R), who sponsored the legislation in her state, said she saw it at a conference she attended last year with other legislators but wasn’t sure which. The bills are all sponsored by legislators who support abortion restrictions.

Their chances of passing appear to vary. The legislation is furthest along in West Virginia, where it passed the Senate after amendments removed and then returned the mention of “Baby Olivia,” and Iowa, where it passed through the House on Wednesday night but had so far stalled in the Senate. Neither Kentucky, which has a Democratic governor, nor Missouri has moved on the legislation since its introduction in January.

Abortion rights advocates and Democrats said the mandates were part of the culture wars playing out over abortion and what is taught in schools.

“In my opinion, it’s propaganda,” said Iowa state Rep. Molly Buck (D), who was the lone vote against advancing that state’s bill out of subcommittee. “Their goal is to promote that life starts at conception.”

The bill’s supporters insist it simply aims to teach students the stages of pregnancy.

“People are trying to frame this as about politics, but it’s really about basic biology 101,” said Jeff Pitts, who lobbied for the bill as the legislative affairs director of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Caucus. “I’m pro-life, but that’s not what this bill is about. It’s about teaching kids the whole truth.”

Yet many acknowledge that changed views on abortion would be a positive side effect — and maybe even a likely one. Rucker, the West Virginia lawmaker, said that the bill’s intention is to teach, not persuade, “but I am certain that it will probably impact the way kids view abortion.”

The sponsor of the one bill that has so far become law went further.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

How each senator voted on delaying a government shutdown

The Senate passed a bill on Thursday to extend the expiration date for federal funding later into March, delaying a partial government shutdown that was set to begin March 2. The continuing resolution will fund roughly 20 percent of government departments until March 8 and the rest through March 22.

Monday’s oral arguments at the Supreme Court in NetChoice, LLC v. Paxton, a dispute over the ability of states to impose constraints on social media companies, were no exception. There was a reference to the “Sir, this is a Wendy’s” meme, which amazingly spurred no questions from the justices. And then there was Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.’s effort to determine the extent to which the rules that apply to a newspaper should apply to history’s largest collection of videos.

“Let’s say YouTube were a newspaper,” Alito asked the attorney for NetChoice, “how much would it weigh?”

Those with an old and sufficiently internet-poisoned memory may slot this into the nation’s long history of people in positions of power not understanding the basic mechanics of how things work. In 2006, then-Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) analogized the internet to a “series of tubes,” which, while not entirely inapt, certainly misses the scale at play. Alito’s comment seems to fall into the same category: Yes, YouTube publishes content, but not really in a way that’s comparable to something like The Washington Post.

In fairness to the justice, he wasn’t actually trying to suggest that the two were comparable. Instead, he was trying to evaluate whether YouTube and similar platforms could be analogized to newspapers in how they curate and present content. The attorney for NetChoice, arguing against limits placed on social media companies by laws passed in Florida and Texas, was arguing that the Supreme Court’s decision in Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo might serve as a useful precedent for the court. (The Wall Street Journal editorial board agrees.) Alito was musing about the difference in the scale of what the Herald could produce for its audience relative to YouTube.

But this is the internet, and the reason discussions of the internet collapse into surreality is that surrealism is the coin of the online realm. So it seemed fitting to try to answer Alito’s question: If YouTube were published as a newspaper, how much would it weigh? How many trucks would we need to carry those papers to subscribers?

We need to begin by considering how big YouTube is.

As it turns out, there’s recent scholarship on this otherwise obscure figure. A team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst created a methodology that allowed them to compile figures estimating the scale and nature of YouTube on an update basis. We learn from their real-time data website, tubestats.org, that there are somewhere north of 14.4 billion videos on YouTube, with more than 412 million already uploaded this year.

But we don’t simply need to know how many YouTube videos there are, any more than we need to know how much storage space they occupy. We need to know what that content would look like when presented in a newspaper format.

So we need to know at least two other things: How many of those videos include spoken content and how long those videos are. (We’ll deal with videos without spoken content in a moment.)

Advertisement

Happily, the researchers have estimates for both. On average, they estimate, YouTube videos are about 615 seconds long. That’s the average, skewed upward by very long videos (the majority of which, according to a 2006 study were “full length, copyrighted videos from TV shows and movies”). The median duration of videos is 61 seconds. But we’re trying to figure out the total for our newspaper here, so we’ll use the average. Multiply the average duration by the number of videos and you get the total playtime of every video on YouTube: about 281,000 years.

The researchers estimate that about 54 percent of the videos they evaluated included spoken language in the first minute. You can see how tricky this all is: The movie WALL-E doesn’t have any spoken language in its first minute, but it certainly includes a lot of dialogue. But we work with what we’ve got, and since The Post is probably not going to pay me to spend 281,000 years watching YouTube, we’ll just assume that about 54 percent of videos include spoken language and, less defensibly, that the speech continues throughout the video consistently.

Why is that necessary? Because we need to figure out how many words are spoken if we’re going to plunk this stuff onto newsprint.

People tend to speak about 150 words a minute. In English, anyway. Which presents a whole different set of problems that we’re going to ignore: how to deal with non-English-language videos. The research team’s assessment of the videos it surveyed found that English was the most popular language used, appearing in 20 percent of the sample videos. That was followed by Hindi, Spanish and … Welsh. (“It is unlikely that Welsh is the fourth most common language on YouTube,” their report notes.)

For our purposes, the language used would mean shifts in what can appear in print. Chinese and, well, Welsh use different amounts of space in print. So we’re just going to pretend that all of the content is translated into English spoken at the above per-minute rate.

We end up discovering that there are about 7.8 billion videos on YouTube with speech, running about 4.8 trillion seconds. That gives us an estimate of just shy of 10 trillion words.

Advertisement

But we’re talking about a newspaper here! Newspapers do not publish every item of news every day, just the new news. (Hence “news.”) So we really only need to look at the 7.2 million videos published each day this year, 3.9 million of which have spoken language. That’s about 2.4 billion seconds of speech, or about 5 billion words.

Great. Now we can turn to the question of how much those newspapers would weigh.

A review of Tuesday’s Washington Post — the premiere example of newspapers, obviously — shows that there are about 1,700 words on the front page and about 3,100 words on a page with only a photo or two. This is our kludge for dealing with videos that don’t include spoken content: Instead of estimating how many words crafting descriptors for those videos would entail, we’re just going to assume they can be summarized visually. Given that nearly half of the videos are image-only, we’ll use our image-heavy front-page word-count estimate here.

So how much does a newspaper weigh? Well, one can look just at the cost of the paper itself, but that misses out on the ink. That depends on the content: More photos means more ink and more weight, albeit in small measure. Multiplied by the billions, though, small measures add up.

Since this is all back-of-the-envelope, let’s use the back-of-the-envelope estimate of a newspaper’s weight generated by Reddit user “mantra” in 2012. He came up with an estimate of 18.4 grams (0.04 pounds) for a lightweight sheet of newsprint and another 12.5 grams (0.028 pounds). That’s just under 31 grams per sheet, or 0.068 pounds.

There are four newspaper pages to a sheet, as you will notice if you pull your newspaper apart. So now we can do our math.

Our 5 billion words of daily YouTube output, matched with lots of photos, would yield about 2.9 million front-page-style pages of content. That would be just north of 50,000 pounds of newspaper.

Advertisement

Or, put another way, to get your newspaper delivered to your house each day, you’d see two semis pull up, one of which disgorged its entire contents and the other of which dropped off a tenth of what it had in its cargo space. If you wanted to get the entirety of YouTube delivered to your house, it would weigh about 100 million pounds, about 85 percent the weight of the Titanic. There would be a line of more than 2,200 trucks lined up to drop them off, a line of trucks stretching more than 30 miles, bumper-to-bumper.

All of this depends on our cop-out of mostly ignoring videos without speech, of course. This makes some sense, given that Alito’s focus was on editorial content in a newspaper. But we can also do some quick calculations centered on the non-spoken-word videos.

Let’s assume we want to include in our paper small stills to convey each video’s content. In a given day, we can estimate that there are about 3.3 million videos with no speaking, lasting about 34.2 million minutes. The normal frame-rate for a video is about 30 per second, but let’s just pick out half that many for economic purposes. That’s still 30.8 billion frames that we’d need to display in our newspaper.

Advertisement

If we print them in an aspect ratio of 4:3 (the ratio used on television) and at a half-inch wide, we can fit about 4,300 stills on one page (allowing for extra space at the edges of the sheet). That’s 7.2 million pages, or 1.8 million four-page sheets. These are heavier, since they’re all ink — totaling about 321,500 pounds. Add in 27,500 pounds for our now picture-free pages of spoken-word videos and the total is about 350,000 pounds of newspaper a day. Eight trucks pulling up to your house and dumping tons of newsprint on your driveway.

The irony to all of this, of course, is that most people receive The Washington Post (and the Miami Herald, for that matter) not in paper form but online, where the weight, like the weight of a YouTube video, has no real meaning. Newspapers are still limited in what they can drop off at people’s houses — which was Alito’s point — but they are not functionally limited in what they can present to readers online.

Put another way, the weight of this article is the weight of the phone in your hand right now (assuming that’s how you’re reading). If you read another article, the cost incurred isn’t in your phone’s weight but in the cost to The Post in hosting and retrieving the content.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

In 2022, the GOP flipped four House seats in New York, helping the party wrest control of the chamber back from Democrats.

The New York Republican Party said Wednesday evening that it would not contest the new map in court.

“Our victory in the Harkenrider case led to fair lines,” Ed Cox, the state’s GOP chairman, said in a statement. “Despite Democrats’ ongoing corruption of the process, these lines are not materially different from those drawn by the special master. As such, there is no need for further litigation.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) hailed the new map as “bipartisan” and said in a statement that it “reunites several communities of interest, reduces the number of counties, towns and villages that are split and promotes compact congressional districts.”

One notable change on the new map is moving the boundary of the 16th Congressional District, represented by Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D), further south to include the heavily Democratic area of Co-Op City in the Bronx. Bowman is a member of the group of liberal lawmakers known as “the Squad” and is facing a primary challenge from Westchester County Executive George Latimer.

Another change comes to the 3rd Congressional District, a seat that Democrat Tom Suozzi won two weeks ago in a special election to replace George Santos, who was expelled late last year. Under the new map, the district will extend further east to include a portion of Suffolk County. And Upstate New York’s 22nd Congressional District, which Rep. Brandon Williams (R) narrowly won in 2022, will see its boundaries extend southwest.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Trump barely mentioned Haley, said Republican state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, who attended the event.

“He said he was feeling good about South Carolina. I don’t honestly recall him even saying anything concrete about her. He doesn’t view her as a factor here because there really isn’t a primary here,” Kimbrell said.

That should be an eye-popping statement in a state where Trump is facing a former two-term governor Saturday and is widely expected to notch another win. Trump’s success is largely because the former president has attracted the widespread support of the state’s evangelical pastors, activists and even the political establishment — even as Haley has outworked and outspent Trump in the state.

The once quadrennial South Carolina political mud fight has been mostly a snoozer, Republicans across South Carolina say. There have been no viral ads or explosive revelations. Roadside signs are scarce driving across the state. On a recent evening at Salty Nut Cafe in downtown Columbia, many said they were unaware when voting would even occur. Across Columbia, conversation centered more on the undefeated South Carolina women’s basketball team than the election in the days leading up to the GOP primary. Gov. Henry McMaster (R), a Trump supporter, was not even in the state for part of the primary’s final week.

“It’s unusual that there isn’t buzz. If you’d told me six months ago there would have been this attitude, I thought it would have been a knock-down, drag-out. It seems people have sort of made up their mind about Trump and they aren’t changing,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in an interview.

Instead, the state’s top Republicans, who largely did not back Trump in 2016, have lined up behind him en masse, literally and figuratively, lending credence to the argument the election is a fait accompli. His team, along with the state’s top lawmakers, aggressively courted state officials and deployed them across South Carolina — even to events Trump skipped himself — and to New Hampshire to campaign against Haley. The biggest blow, people who know Haley say, was Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) standing onstage with Trump after she lost to him in the Granite State. Haley appointed Scott to his U.S. Senate seat.

“Her only elected congressional endorsement is Ralph Norman. What does that tell you?” said Rep. William Timmons (R), an upstate congressman backing Trump, referring to a congressman who backed Haley. Norman did not respond to a request for comment.

Even some Haley allies were privately predicting she would lose Saturday’s primary by 20 points and began trying to lower expectations in the days leading up to the contest, spinning that losing her home state by 10 or 15 points would, actually, be a win. Haley says she’s in the contest for the long haul — Super Tuesday, where 15 states vote, is on March 5 — but that could change if she’s trounced in her own state.

“I’m real proud of what Nikki Haley has done,” said Katon Dawson, a top Haley adviser in South Carolina, when asked whether she had a chance. “Donald Trump knows how to bottle anger and sell it. Nikki Haley knows how to bottle optimism and hope. It’s easier to sell hate so it’s an uphill battle.”

Haley’s allies say they feel like they have been tilting at proverbial windmills in recent weeks, trying to convince state Republicans to move on from Trump because he is not in the party’s best interest.

They have attempted to bring independents and Democrats into the fold and have repeatedly touted polls showing Haley beating Biden by large margins in a general election. Anyone who did not vote in the Feb. 3 Democratic primary can vote in the state’s Republican one.

Gresham Barrett, a former congressman who is close to Haley, said he has struggled to understand Trump’s grip on the state’s evangelical voters. When he first ran for Congress, Barrett said even an “innuendo of impropriety” could be enough to disqualify a candidate. Now, he said, some of his longtime supporters and Trump backers don’t even want to talk to him after learning he is for Haley. They won’t brook any criticism of Trump, and many voters like him more after he was charged with 91 felonies, Barrett said.

“I cannot figure it out,” he said.

While both campaigns aggressively recruited pastors in recent weeks, Trump has far more evangelical support, according to 10 Republican lawmakers and operatives here. One top operative said Haley’s team had struggled to get pastors to back them — including many pastors who liked her in the past.

“It’s kind of very surprising to me how very little traction she’s been able to get even with pastors who supported her in her gubernatorial races,” said a prominent operative unaffiliated in the race. “It’s a combination of the charges against him, his record, which in their minds is unassailable, and the inevitability of the whole thing.”

Pastors in South Carolina have convened calls for Trump, made public declarations on his behalf and told their congregations that Trump deserves support because he is vilified, much like Christians have been, according to state operatives and lawmakers.

Al Phillips, a prominent pastor in Greenville, said he was flooded with appeals from both campaigns. Pastors are often influential, he said, because even though most will not endorse a candidate from the pulpit — they will tell their church members privately who they support.

“Pastors seem to be overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, although I think a lot of pastors are a little bit afraid to say they are for Trump because it’s such a polarizing issue. A lot of pastors that I talk to very much support Trump. They have issues with his character and his nature but really like his policies,” Phillips said.

Phillips said that Trump’s record on abortion — appointing the Supreme Court justices that enabled the overturning of Roe vs. Wade — was one of the main reasons so many South Carolina voters support him, and that the former president had a strong organization in the state. “He just appeals to staunch conservatives in a way [Haley] doesn’t,” Phillips said. “He has been almost invincible here from the get-go.”

Haley, the generally popular but never beloved governor, who backed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in 2016, has a tortured history with Trump. After his election, she was appointed to the United Nations before becoming a Trump defender during his presidency — then critic, then defender, then vowing not to run against him in 2021, then running against him in 2023, then critic anew.

She has sought to make her home state’s primary an actual race, showing a stubborn willingness to keep fighting that many recognize from her time as governor. Haley has spoken at more than 40 events in recent weeks, crossing the state in an emblazoned bus and eviscerating Trump in a way few Republican candidates have done to date, questioning his mental fitness and highlighting his criminal and civil trials, among other criticisms, and saying that Trump cannot win the general election.

“He will not defeat Joe Biden in November and he will drag the entire Republican ticket down with him,” Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney said Friday of Trump.

Haley raised more than $11 million in January, filings show, and has spent more than $15 million on TV in the last month.

“Every 30 seconds there’s a Haley ad. She has spent a boat load of money, and he’s spending nothing,” Graham said. Trump’s ads have attacked Haley for wanting to raise the age of Social Security recipients and on immigration, saying she is not tough enough on the border.

Even some who have known Haley for years are perplexed by her kamikaze-style determination to forge ahead, saying she must believe Trump is going to be criminally convicted and Republicans are going to change their mind about their best hope of defeating Biden in November. Others argue Haley wants vindication as the last Republican standing against Trump if he ultimately loses in the fall and the GOP begins to grapple with its choices. And some others say she has a small coterie of advisers — many who have never seen her lose a race — and still has copious money to burn. “Maybe it’s the idea he slips and falls somewhere,” Graham said.

Barrett said the answer to why Haley remains in the race is simple. She believes she can still win.

“I was in politics for a long time, and this woman is one of the hardest workers, if not the hardest worker, I have ever seen,” Barrett said. “She is in it for the long haul. She is determined to go to the goal line because she believes she can win, she honestly does. The conversations I’ve had with her, even privately, there is no doubt in her mind she is going to be the nominee.”

Trump, meanwhile, has spent a little more than $1 million in the state. He has held a handful of his signature rallies and large events, far fewer than Haley, most notably a rally in Conway, where he seemed to threaten the existence of NATO by encouraging Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” if European allies don’t contribute 2 percent of their GDP to the alliance.

On Friday, he held two events, appearing in Columbia for a Black conservative gala and in Rock Hill for one of his trademark rallies. “Nikki Haley is relying on Democrats and liberals,” Trump said to boos. “The biggest supporters she has right now [are] the Biden supporters.”

There is a risk to staying in the race, even some of her advisers fear, if she wants a political future. Haley has angered many South Carolina Republicans by continuing to slash Trump and stay in the race, costing him money and diverting attention from Biden.

“Is she going to stay in until the last vote’s cast? Do you know how irresponsible that is? I’m going to drag the Republican Party through an unnecessary fight with an inevitable outcome all for personal gain,” Timmons said. “If she would have gotten out three weeks ago, people would have respected that. But this is the end of her political career. What she is doing is not good for the Republican Party, not good for the country, not good for her.”

Haley has dismissed the talk. “I don’t care about my political future. If I did, I would have been out by now,” she said this week.

Dawson said he was under no illusions about how the race might end, but he argues Republicans would come to regret nominating Trump. The former state party chair said Republicans were once about adding to the party, not just appealing to hardcore supporters. He doesn’t think Trump can do that.

“Everything we do for Donald Trump puts us on the line as a party. His coattails have been skinny every time, and we keep making the same choice. He needs to go build his museum at Mar-a-Lago so he can up the price for getting in one more time. He’s going to need it because he’s broke,” Dawson said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Liberal justices suggested the devices were exactly what Congress had in mind when it long ago imposed restrictions on machine guns. Some conservative justices, however, said the law’s language was not so clear.

The bump stock ban represents one of the few steps by the federal government to address the gun violence that has traumatized the United States, as both Congress and some courts have resisted other firearm restrictions. Although more than a dozen states and D.C. separately restrict the use of bump stocks, a ruling that tosses out the national ban would make the devices legal in many places and could make it more difficult for the federal government to limit access to other firearms and accessories.

Throughout oral argument Wednesday, several liberal and conservative justices expressed concern about dangerous weapons and the bloody damage that can be done by a rifle affixed with a bump stock. But it was not certain based on their questions whether the court, with its 6-3 conservative supermajority, would uphold the ban.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative, said that while she is “entirely sympathetic” to the government’s argument, she has concerns that Congress’s law restricting access to machine guns did not clearly cover bump stocks. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, also a conservative, said he can “certainly understand why these items should be made illegal” but suggested it would be up to lawmakers to do so explicitly.

Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in contrast, said bump stocks are “the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause.” Justice Elena Kagan, also a liberal, said the “torrent of bullets” fired by rifles equipped with the devices is “in the heartland” of what lawmakers were concerned about when they passed the statute.

Michael Cargill, a U.S. Army veteran and the owner of a gun store in Austin, challenged the Trump-era rules after he was forced to surrender two bump stocks. Cargill says the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives overstepped its authority when it reinterpreted long-standing federal limits on machine guns to cover the devices.

The case is one of two before the Supreme Court this term involving gun restrictions — and one of several cases challenging the power of federal agencies, long targeted by conservatives wary of what they consider government overregulation.

Cargill is represented by the New Civil Liberties Alliance, one of the conservative legal organizations that is also behind an effort to upend a 40-year-old court precedent known as Chevron, which often requires judges to defer to the expertise of agency officials when evaluating statutes.

Cargill’s lawsuit to recover his bump stock devices was filed before the Supreme Court’s landmark decision 2022 expanding gun rights by requiring the government to point to historical analogues when defending laws that limit Second Amendment rights. That ruling is at issue in the other gun case before the court this term, which questions the legality of a law barring gun ownership by individuals subject to domestic-violence protective orders.

The question before the court Wednesday, in contrast, did not directly involve the Second Amendment. Instead, the justices examined whether ATF officials properly interpreted a statute that has barred nonmilitary access to machine guns since 1986.

Much of the discussion centered on how a bump stock operates and whether its use amounts to a “single function of the trigger.” The argument was at various times a lesson in grammar, physics and the mechanics of firearms. During one exchange, Kagan and Cargill’s attorney, Jonathan Mitchell, took turns using their hands to demonstrate what it looks like to fire a gun affixed with the device.

Bump stocks are molded pieces of plastic or metal that replace the standard rifle stock that rests against a shooter’s shoulder. The device harnesses a gun’s natural recoil, allowing the rifle to bounce or “bump” rapidly back and forth off a shooter’s trigger finger. Rifles equipped with bump stocks can fire an estimated 400 to 800 bullets per minute, a rate comparable to military machine guns.

The National Firearms Act defines machine guns as firearms that shoot, are designed to shoot or can be readily restored to shoot “automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger” as well as any part designed and intended solely “for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun.”

The Biden administration, defending the Trump administration’s interpretation, told the court that the devices allow a rifle to fire more than one shot automatically and that a single motion initiates and maintains the firing.

“As long as the shooter maintains that steady forward pressure, the rifle will fire continuously until it runs out of bullets, and it will empty a 100-round magazine like the ones used in the Las Vegas shooting in about 10 seconds,” said Principal Deputy Solicitor General Brian Fletcher. “Those weapons do exactly what Congress meant to prohibit when it enacted the prohibition on machine guns.”

Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general, vigorously disputed that description, saying the rapid fire is produced through repeated manual activations of the trigger — not a single motion.

A rifle equipped with a bump stock can fire “only one shot per function of the trigger because the trigger must reset after every shot and must function again before another shot can be fired,” he said.

ATF’s assessment of bump stock devices and interpretation of the law has changed over time. In 2003, the agency said an early version was not a machine gun because it did not fire more than one shot with a single function of the trigger. Three years later, the agency changed its position and classified the early model with an internal spring as a machine gun.

Cargill’s attorneys emphasize that for nearly a decade, between 2008 and 2017, the federal government did not count later versions of the devices — without the internal spring — as machine guns. During that time, Americans bought 520,000 bump stocks.

President Donald Trump’s bump stock ban gave owners until March 2019 to destroy or turn over their devices. Gorsuch and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh expressed concern about the possibility that a half-million people could be prosecuted if they purchased the devices before the rules changed. But Fletcher sought to reassure them that ATF does not have the power to make something a crime that was not a crime before.

The two justices were among several conservatives who questioned the government’s evolving interpretation of the statute, with Kavanaugh noting that bump stocks were not banned during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Gorsuch questioned the Trump and Biden administrations’ decision to apply to bump stocks a statute first passed in the 1930s, even though other administrations thought differently.

Fletcher said ATF was correcting past mistakes, just as the Supreme Court often does when it decides a statute is being interpreted incorrectly.

“After the Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest shooting in our nation’s history, I think it would have been irresponsible for the ATF not to take another closer look at this prior interpretation,” Fletcher said.

The justices’ questions Wednesday did not always break along the familiar ideological lines. Justice Clarence Thomas noted that the statute was initially passed because of the lethality of machine guns. Behind the latest ban, he said, is the “notion that the bump stock does the exact same thing.”

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked Mitchell if he could imagine a legislator thinking Congress should ban machine guns but not bump stocks.

In reply, the attorney said bump stocks can help people who have disabilities and people who have arthritis in their fingers shoot their weapons. “There are respectable arguments for why these could remain legal as a matter of policy,” he said.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor quickly followed up, asking, “Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7 or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?”

The court’s conservatives are proponents of textualism — a method of interpretation that considers only the words of the law being reviewed, not legislators’ intent or the consequences of the decision. But there were varying opinions expressed by the justices about how to read this particular statute.

“Maybe they should have written something better. One might hope they might write something better in the future. But that’s the language we’re stuck with,” Gorsuch said, taking issue with the government’s reading of the text to include bump stocks.

Kagan said she too considers herself a “good textualist” but came to the opposite conclusion: that the statute must encompass the devices.

“Textualism is not inconsistent with common sense,” Kagan said. “At some point, you have to apply a little bit of common sense to the way you read a statute and understand that what this statute comprehends is a weapon that fires a multitude of shots with a single human action.”

Cargill’s challenge to the bump stock ban was rejected in district court and before a unanimous panel of the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.

But the 5th Circuit reversed that ruling after a full complement of judges reheard the case. An eight-judge majority concluded the definition of machine gun in the statute does not cover bump stocks in part because “to continue firing after the shooter pulls the trigger, he or she must maintain manual, forward pressure on the barrel and manual, backward pressure [with the trigger finger],” Judge Jennifer Elrod wrote.

Five other judges argued that the definition was ambiguous but said the court was required under a rule of interpretation in cases involving criminal law to resolve the matter in Cargill’s favor.

In dissent, Judge Stephen Higginson, joined by two colleagues, criticized the majority for invoking the rule to “rewrite a vital public safety statute” and to “legalize an instrument of mass murder.”

The Justice Department then asked the Supreme Court to intervene.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Their losses highlight the victory of Donald Trump’s “America First” over Ronald Reagan’s “tear down this wall” as the foreign policy doctrine of the Republican Party.

Trump’s reshaping of the Republican Party has been an evolving story. As president, he embraced some traditional Republican positions, for example on tax cuts for the wealthy. But he moved the party from one that pushed for free trade to one that pushed tariffs. Rather than trying to rein in government, he spent freely and allowed the national debt to balloon.

Nowhere, however, has his influence been more pronounced and potentially consequential than in what has become a full reversal of the internationalism that was central to Republican orthodoxy through most of the post-World War II era. Both McConnell in his role in the Senate and Haley as Trump’s last remaining challenger for the GOP nomination for president have vigorously opposed this part of Trump’s policy prescriptions.

Haley has lost contests to Trump in one state after another, but has refused to do what Trump had expected, which was to graciously concede defeat and step to the sidelines. She faces another brutal series of contests in the coming days, with 15 alone on Super Tuesday, which are likely to add significantly to Trump’s growing delegate lead.

She has said Trump was the right president at the right time. She agrees with many of his domestic politics, though not his fiscal stance. She served in his administration as United Nations ambassador. She has stepped up her criticism of him as a man unhinged. Where she parts company most emphatically is on the question of America’s role in the world.

She likes to say “the world is on fire,” with conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and brewing problems elsewhere. She advocates more military aid for Ukraine and argues against Trump’s “America First” worldview. Her argument, shared by others, is that a retreat by the United States from a leadership role in the world leaves both this country and the world at large less safe in the face of threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.

She harks back to a different Republican Party, a party that has been in retreat since Trump first ran for president. She wins votes — 20 percent or 30 percent or even 40 percent in states where she has competed — but she is not winning the argument.

If the next round of primaries goes as expected, with Trump triumphant, Haley will face more calls to withdraw. She has been defiant in resisting those calls to date, marching to the beat of her own drum. But to what end? For there is little to suggest that she can now or in the near future arrest the inward turn within her party.

McConnell announced on Wednesday that he will step down as Senate leader in November, ending the longest run as a party leader in the Senate’s history. Many factors contributed to the decision, including his age and his health as well as a painful family loss.

But McConnell was clear in acknowledging that there was more than a losing battle against Father Time that brought him to the decision. “Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time,” he said in announcing his decision. “I have many faults. Misunderstanding politics is not one of them.”

Like Haley, McConnell agreed with Trump on many issues, especially for what will be remembered as McConnell’s most significant and controversial accomplishment: the remaking of the federal judiciary and the Supreme Court. This was as much or more a McConnell initiative as a Trump priority.

McConnell’s hardball tactics in that fight will not be forgotten. He balked at filling one vacancy in 2016 while President Barack Obama was still in office, refusing even to allow a hearing on Obama’s nominee, current Attorney General Merrick Garland. That gave Trump the opportunity to nominate conservative Justice Neil M. Gorsuch in early 2017.

Weeks before the 2020 election, McConnell rammed through another Trump nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. In between, Trump nominated and McConnell helped facilitate the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

That 6-3 conservative majority produced the most politically explosive decision of recent times in 2022, the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended half a century of the constitutional right to an abortion.

By his actions, McConnell endeared himself to conservatives but became a reviled figure, particularly on the left, leaving a permanent scar on his legacy. And yet, for all he did with regard to the judiciary, his increasingly open disdain for Trump and Trump’s petulant hostility toward him have left him isolated within his party.

His missed opportunity to prevent Trump from running in 2024 came when he voted to acquit the former president in the impeachment trial resulting from the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol, despite excoriating Trump for his role in the attack after the acquittal.

McConnell was elected to the Senate in 1984, the same year Reagan scored a landslide reelection victory. He has seen the world through the prism of the Reagan doctrine, which espoused the need for robust U.S. leadership in the world. Reagan successfully challenged the Soviet Union, leading to his memorable call to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. The wall came down after Reagan left office, and the Soviet Union collapsed soon after. That is the world in which McConnell was shaped.

The Trump doctrine is the reverse of the Reagan doctrine — a pulling back from world leadership, an insular rather than an expansive view of the United States, a feeling that others should shoulder the burden, and even a belief that the United States has been used and abused by its allies.

Rather than challenging the Russians, Trump long has cozied up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has hectored leaders of allied nations and offered praise to authoritarian leaders who have risen around the world.

Advertisement

Most notably, he has repeatedly denigrated the NATO alliance, which has been a bulwark against Soviet and later Russian aggression. Recently, he offered a green light to the Russians to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that don’t spend enough on defense.

Statements like that are the reason there is as much concern among U.S. allies about what a second Trump presidency would mean for them and for the world at large.

Today, one big issue that separates both McConnell and Haley from Trump is Ukraine and whether the United States will maintain its commitment to help supply that nation with the arms and other equipment needed to continue its resistance in the face of Russia’s invasion two years ago.

McConnell and Haley believe it is essential to do so. The followers of Trump resist. Opposition among elected officials is stronger in the House, where Republicans more directly reflect — or accept — Trump’s “America First” views.

Advertisement

But even in McConnell’s Senate, many senators appear to stand closer to Trump. When the Senate approved the $95 billion package for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies, McConnell voted in favor but 26 of his Republican colleagues voted no.

McConnell said he plans to serve out his current term, which ends in early 2027. As a former leader, he will have more freedom to speak for himself, but will his voice resonate with the power it once had? Haley has given no indication of what will follow her campaign for the presidency. Will she use her voice to continue to challenge Trump’s foreign policy views, especially if he wins in November, in the hope of rebuilding a consensus for Reaganism?","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Democrats could scarcely be more anxious to have that debate — and Republicans could scarcely be more uneasy about it. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The most recent developments: Alabama Republicans rushed to pass legislation to protect IVF in the state, which the state Supreme Court jeopardized when it ruled that embryos are children. But Republicans in Congress are largely begging off the need for federal legislation. As she did in 2022, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) blocked a bill from Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) that would establish a federal right to assistive reproductive care like IVF.

(Hyde-Smith claimed that the bill featured “poison pills” that would “subject religious and pro-life organizations to crippling lawsuits.” She also wagered that the bill would “legalize the creation of human-animal chimeras.”)

Democrats are now accusing Hyde-Smith and the GOP of insufficient and disingenuous support for IVF. Republicans offered a procession of statements backing IVF last week after an extraordinary Senate GOP memo warning of the political danger of avoiding the subject.

It’s become clear that Republicans would prefer to say they support IVF, let the Alabama legislature fix their state’s problem, and be done with it. But the Alabama Supreme Court also spotlighted how that might not be possible in a post-Roe v. Wade world. Supporting the concept of people having babies through IVF is one thing; accounting for the routine disposal of embryos, a part of IVF protocol, is quite another.

Some new polling gets at the dilemma for the GOP.

An Axios/Ipsos poll Wednesday effectively asked about the Alabama Supreme Court decision — the idea that embryos are children and that those who destroy them can be held legally responsible. Americans opposed this more than 2 to 1, 66 percent to 31 percent.

Advertisement

But Republicans were evenly split: 49-49.

The story was virtually the same in an Economist/YouGov poll. It got into a little more detail, noting that IVF creates embryos that are not used before asking whether un-implanted embryos should be considered children.

Americans said embryos were not children by a 50 percent to 21 percent margin. But Republicans were again about evenly split: 31 percent said they were children, while 32 percent said they were not. (More than one-third were undecided.)

Then we get to the rub. The same poll asked whether people supported IVF and what they thought of its morality. Republicans said 58-13 that IVF should be legal, and just 14 percent said it was “morally wrong.”

In other words, there is not a huge segment of the party that condemns IVF; there is, however a significant chunk that regards embryos as children — as much as half. And that’s a difficult thing to account for, because IVF leads to discarded embryos.

Advertisement

This isn’t the only evidence of a stumbling block for the GOP, if it’s forced to reckon with the details.

A 2022 YouGov poll asked people about when they thought life began, offering a series of options. About half of Republicans said it began when an egg is fertilized (before it is implanted). This is basically the stage at which unused embryos exist in IVF.

That view aligns with a proposal supported by a strong majority of House Republicans — the Life at Conception Act — which would define personhood to include “the moment of fertilization.”

One supporter is House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), among his party’s leading Christian conservatives. But on Thursday, Johnson wasn’t anxious to square his views on when life begins with his professed support for IVF.

Asked whether he regarded discarding embryos as murder, Johnson avoided a direct answer.

“Look, I believe in the sanctity of every human life — always have,” Johnson said. “And because of that, I support IVF and its availability.”

About the closest he came to addressing the question was saying that IVF “needs to be handled in an ethical manner.”

Biden used his visit to Brownsville, a Democratic stronghold, to blame Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, for killing a bipartisan border bill that would have provided $20 billion to hire thousands of new Border Patrol agents and asylum officers and increase detention capacity. The measure also would have included a trigger mechanism to effectively shut down the border, which Biden said he would have been willing to invoke.

Biden said the bill was on its way to passage until Trump “came along and said, ‘Don’t do that, it will benefit the incumbent.’” The president added sarcastically, “It’s a hell of a way to do business in the United States of America.”

Addressing Republican members of Congress, Biden urged them to “show a little spine” and demonstrate independence from Trump. “Let’s remember who we work for, for God’s sake,” Biden said. He ended by addressing Trump directly: “Instead of playing politics with this issue, join me — or I’ll join you — in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together.”

About 300 miles away in Eagle Pass, Trump renewed his embrace of a tough-on-immigration message that was central to his political rise in 2016 and that he has made a centerpiece of his third presidential campaign. “This is a Joe Biden invasion, this is a Biden invasion,” the former president said of the influx of illegal migrants.

“The United States is being overrun by the Biden migrant crime,” Trump added. “It’s a new form of vicious violation to our country.” Experts say most of the evidence suggests that undocumented immigrants do not cause more crime.

The remarkable split-screen — the presidential contenders each delivered their speeches at about the same time — provided a preview of what could be a long and bitter general election campaign. Biden took office announcing his determination to handle immigration more humanely than Trump, whose rhetoric on migrants was often incendiary. But he has faced periodic images of chaos at the border during his presidency, and in recent weeks he has taken a harder line.

Ahead of his remarks, Biden received a briefing from Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In each session, presenters highlighted how few resources they have to address the surge of migration at the border, the flow of fentanyl and the need to process asylum claims.

Biden, in response, continually stressed that the bipartisan border security bill would have allowed for the hiring of significantly more personnel and help alleviate each agency’s problems.

Biden, who polls show faces widespread disapproval of his handling of immigration, has in recent weeks tried to take control of the issue by reminding voters that he embraced the bipartisan immigration measure and its tough enforcement provisions. Republican lawmakers had demanded border security measures as part of a sweeping aid bill for Ukraine and Israel, but they refused to back the package after Trump said on Truth Social that enacting it would be “another Gift to the Radical Left Democrats.”

Trump has long made immigration the focus of his “America First” agenda. He campaigned in 2016 on building a U.S.-Mexico border wall and has vowed to enact “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” in a second term. He has repeatedly blamed Biden for a record number of apprehensions since 2021.

Trump has also used dehumanizing language to describe undocumented immigrants, suggesting that they are waging an “invasion” of the United States and accusing them of “poisoning the blood of our country,” prompting civil rights activists and historians to compare his language to Nazi rhetoric.

On Thursday, the former president cast undocumented immigrants as deeply alien. “We have languages coming into our country, we have nobody that even speaks those languages,” he said. “They’re truly foreign languages, nobody speaks them. They’re pouring into our country and they’re bringing with them tremendous problems, including medical problems, as you know.”

Biden and Trump chose border cities for their Thursday appearances that reflect their dueling approaches to immigration. Brownsville is in sync with Democrats’ traditional approach of balancing border security with humanitarian considerations. Eagle Pass, by contrast, has become a symbol of Republican defiance against Biden’s handling of immigration. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) seized a park in the city earlier this year, shutting out U.S. Border Patrol agents who had long used it as a staging point.

Illegal border crossings soared in the months after Biden took office, signaling a more relaxed policy and immediately rolling back many Trump-era restrictions. As immigration surged, Biden warned that he would still enforce immigration laws, and he temporarily kept in place a Trump pandemic policy known as Title 42 that allowed authorities to quickly expel border crossers.

Even so, the number of people taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol has reached the highest levels in the agency’s 100-year history under Biden, averaging 2 million per year.

In the U.S. interior, the Biden administration has said that ICE agents should not arrest someone just for being undocumented, to prevent longtime residents from being deported. Officials say they are deporting or removing record numbers of border crossers and prioritizing the removal of serious offenders. Many migrants say they are surrendering to seek protection in the United States and permission to work.

Biden laid the blame for the demise of the bipartisan border bill at the feet of Trump and his Republican allies.

“I want the people to understand clearly what happened here: This bill was in the United States Senate, was on its way to being passed, and it was derailed by rank partisan politics,” Biden said. “The U.S. Senate needs to reconsider this bill, and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits, not whether it’s going to benefit one party or the other party.”

In Eagle Pass, Trump, alongside Abbott, received a briefing on Operation Lone Star, Abbott’s state-led border crackdown. He then took a tour of Shelby Park and walked toward the Rio Grande, the river separating the United States and Mexico. People across the border shouted his name as he took the tour.

Trump praised Texas’ immigration policies, while criticizing Democratic governors in Arizona and California for not doing enough to secure the border.

Trump continued to paint undocumented immigrants as violent, describing them as “coming from jails and they’re coming from prisons and they’re coming from mental institutions.”

Most of those arrested at the southern border do not have criminal convictions, federal data show.

A February Gallup survey found that voters ranked immigration as the single most important problem facing the country, followed by the government, the economy and inflation. A Marquette Law School national poll this month found 53 percent of registered voters saying Trump would do a better job handling the issue, while 25 percent said Biden would.

Frustrated by Congress’s inaction, Biden has been considering executive actions that could limit unauthorized migration and restrict the asylum process, according to administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. But he did not announce any new actions Thursday, and it is not clear if the White House will be able to identify actions the president can take without congressional authorization.

Many Democratic operatives concede that it would be difficult for Biden to completely upend the political dynamic on immigration. But the White House hopes that his tougher stance, and his repeated reminders that he was eager to sign a border enforcement bill that Trump torpedoed, can at a minimum blunt Republicans’ advantage on the issue.

Trump’s immigration platform includes reinstating a travel ban from his previous presidential term that restricted people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. The Trump campaign has also said he would sign an executive order that would withhold passports, Social Security numbers and other government benefits from the children of undocumented immigrants.

While Biden has taken political hits on immigration since becoming president, Trump also faced a backlash during his own time in the White House for some of his harder-hitting policies. As president, Trump signed executive orders to enact his travel ban, but it faced numerous court challenges and was significantly reduced in scope. His administration also drew fire for a policy of separating migrant families, which was seen even by some conservatives as unduly harsh.

Trump made building a border wall a central promise of his 2016 campaign, and his administration built more than 450 miles of new border fencing at a cost of $11 billion. Despite that construction, illegal border crossings have surged from 500,000 per year in 2020 to more than 2 million last year.

In Thursday’s appearance at Eagle Pass, the former president said that he had spoken to the parents of Laken Hope Riley, a Georgia nursing student who was allegedly killed by Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan migrant. U.S. government records show Ibarra came to the country in 2022 after crossing the border illegally. Riley’s death is one of several cases in recent years that Republican politicians have highlighted to depict migrants as dangerous.

“The monster charged in the death is an illegal alien migrant, who was led into our country, and released into our communities by Crooked Joe Biden,” Trump said. “Joe Biden will never say Laken Riley’s name, but we will say it.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Yes, Trump indicated that the mug shot that accompanied his arrest in Georgia had been embraced by “the Black population” more than any other group. “You see Black people walking around with my mug shot,” he said. “You know, they do shirts and they sell them for $19 a piece.” Those shirts are for sale, but are almost certainly more commonly worn by White Trump supporters at Trump events.

After years of deriding the Black Lives Matter movement and shrugging at its focus on institutional racism, Trump also told his audience that this idea was correct.

“Black conservatives understand better than most that some of the greatest evils in our nation’s history have come from corrupt systems that try to target and subjugate others, to deny them their freedom and to deny them their rights,” he told the audience. “I think that’s why the Black people are so much on my side now, because they see what’s happening to me, happens to them.”

By “what’s happening to me,” of course, he meant that he’d been criminally indicted. Black votes matter, it seems.

Those were the relatively sophisticated presentations. More than once he awkwardly tried to make his regular patter more Black-oriented, in obvious ways. His recent riffs about President Biden wearing a bathing suit (don’t ask) became a testament to how even Cary Grant — or better, Sidney Poitier! — wouldn’t look great in a bathing suit at 81. He insisted that having the Black unemployment rate hit a historic low during his presidency was a record akin to Babe Ruth’s home run record — or rather, Barry Bonds’s! (The record was broken under Biden.)

Reading from the teleprompter as his BCF speech was wrapping up, he had an extended riff about how “Black Americans have been a vital part of the American story, helping to make this the greatest nation in the history of the world.”

“So true!” he added, as though someone else had been saying the thing he just said.

Trump’s rhetoric demands that his actions are the best possible actions and his opponents the worst, so he also at one point offered a sweeping assessment of Biden.

“It’s the only thing he’s really been good at his entire career. You know what that is?” Trump said. “Being a racist. Because he’s a racist.” Biden was also the person who was the real threat to democracy, Trump said in the same speech, just as Hillary Clinton was the real puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as he said in a 2016 debate.

All of this is astonishingly unsubtle. Trump’s pitch to Black voters used to center on a disparagement of the failure of Democrats to solve every race-related problem with a shrugging “What do you have to lose?” Now, after serving as president for four years, he frames his presidency as a staggering success — better for Black Americans than probably even Lincoln! — and declares that Black people like him because he was arrested. He’s long suggested that Black people are mostly worried about inner-city crime, a revelation of how he views the Black experience, so this is just turning the dial up a notch.

And the crowd at the event applauded heartily.

The Biden campaign dismissed Trump’s remarks as “racist” and “insulting.”

“Donald Trump claiming that Black Americans will support him because of his criminal charges is insulting. It’s moronic. And it’s just plain racist,” Cedric L. Richmond, Biden’s campaign co-chair, said in a statement.

The next day, Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington. He left out most of the pitch to Black voters but did again try to frame Biden as antidemocratic, saying the president is “surrounded by some very bad fascists.” Prowling the convention floor, meanwhile, were overt white nationalists and Nazis, according to NBC News.

It’s a reminder that Republican and Trump’s own efforts to appeal to Black and Hispanic voters are happening as the party also centers heavily on the politics of White grievance, including in its most extreme forms. The “great replacement theory,” centered on a conspiracy involving immigration, is broadly accepted among Republicans, creating oxygen for fringe-right racists like those NBC saw at CPAC.

But that is also occurring as Republicans are doing better with non-White voters. Speaking to BCF, Trump celebrated that Republicans had “increased our share of the Black vote by 50 percent — five-oh” in 2020, adding that “we earned more votes from African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans than any Republican in generations.” This is based on comparing his 8 percent of Black support in 2016 exit polls with 12 percent in 2020, but those numbers are probably too high.

Data from Gallup, though, shows that the margin by which Black and Hispanic Americans prefer Democrats has shrunk since 2020. During Barack Obama’s presidency, Black Americans were 71 points more likely to identify as Democrats, according to Gallup’s annual data. During Trump’s presidency, the gap was 66 points. Since then, the average has been only 55 points, including a 47-point gap in 2023. Among Hispanics, the 30-point Democratic advantage during Trump’s presidency has become a 20-point edge.

Views of Trump himself have softened among Black Americans since he left office. When he was president, YouGov polling for the Economist found that 77 percent of Black Americans viewed him unfavorably each month on average. But that’s fallen since, as has the percentage of Black Americans who view him very unfavorably. Overall, the percentage of Americans who view Trump unfavorably hasn’t changed much.

You’ll note that the drop in Trump’s unfavorability among Black Americans predates his indictments and his Georgia mug shot and — as one enthusiastic Fox News guest suggested — his sneaker line. In fact, when the indictments landed, Trump’s unfavorable ratings among Black Americans increased as they did overall. That bump then faded.

There are some structural factors at play here, including that younger Black Americans — who make up more of the electorate — are more likely to be politically independent, like younger Americans generally. It’s possible, too, that the post-2020 shifts are less about Trump than about the other changes that have unfolded during and since that epochal year. Reports have also consistently noted Black dissatisfaction with Biden’s administration, which makes skepticism of his party more likely.

As Trump tends to, he sees all of this as being about Trump. His rhetoric to Black voters is more explicitly pandering in part because he seems to think it works. His dubious rhetoric to non-Black voters — like that the prosecutors targeting him are doing so because they are “racist” — can similarly be excused as long as that improvement exists.

And as long as those audiences don’t compare notes.

“I’m being indicted for you, the American people,” he said to the BCF crowd. “I’m being indicted for you, the Black population.”

If nothing else, we can say that, somehow and so far, the pandering doesn’t not work.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The campaign

Michigan was a stress test for Biden, Trump and Haley

President Biden and former president Donald Trump won the Democratic and Republican primaries in Michigan by huge margins Tuesday night — but there were serious problems for both candidates lurking under the surface.

The primaries were a stress test in a swing state for both campaigns. Biden and Trump are wrestling with dissatisfaction within their parties even as they appear poised to win their nominations.

Trump defeated Nikki Haley by his widest margin to date on Tuesday in the Michigan primary, crushing her 68 percent to 27 percent.

Biden, meanwhile, won the Democratic primary by an even more overwhelming margin — but 13 percent of voters marked their ballots “uncommitted” following a campaign to persuade voters to not to support Biden in protest of his support for Israel and his refusal to call for a cease-fire in Gaza.

Biden’s primary rivals, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and Marianne Williamson, each won about 3 percent of the vote. (Williamson dropped out this month, but her name remained on the ballot.)

And many Democrats are furious with Biden for failing to demand a halt to Israel’s war in Gaza — especially in Michigan, which has one of the biggest Arab American populations in the country.

Trouble for Trump?

Trump has faced a bloc of voters in primaries in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan — the three states where he’s had one-on-one matchups with Haley — who refuse to support him, although the percentage of such voters has declined as each state has voted.

While Trump has won every primary so far, Haley’s ability to keep winning so many votes even though she lacks a clear path to the nomination raises questions about how many of her voters will back Trump in November.

Trump’s relative weakness is notable because he could essentially be viewed an incumbent, with a longer track record in the White House than Biden’s. But he is also under indictment in federal and state court on charges of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election, among other counts.

“Joe Biden is losing about 20 percent of the Democratic vote today, and many say it’s a sign of his weakness in November,” Haley said in a statement Tuesday night. “Donald Trump is losing about 35 percent of the vote. That’s a flashing warning sign for Trump in November.”

Trouble for Haley?

Michigan was also a warning sign for Haley.

In other states, she has run strongest in places with lots of college-educated voters. But she failed to win a single county in Michigan, losing even Washtenaw County, which includes Ann Arbor and where 57 percent of adults 25 and older have bachelor’s degrees.

Mark Tisdel, a Michigan state representative who endorsed Haley, told us before the polls closed that if she ran at least as strong as she did on Saturday in her home state of South Carolina — where she won 39 percent of the vote — it would be a victory. Falling short of that benchmark, he said, “would be very discouraging.”

“I’d like to see her stay in as long as possible,” Tisdel said. “President Trump faces several challenges ahead of him. There are all sorts of land mines out there that he could step on.”

Trouble for Biden?

More than 100,000 Democratic primary voters marked their ballots “uncommitted,” far exceeding the modest goal of 10,000 votes set by Listen to Michigan, the group that organized the campaign.

Still, not everyone who voted “uncommitted” did so to protest Biden’s approach to the war in Gaza.

Armenian Americans waged their own campaign to convince voters to mark “uncommitted” to protest Biden’s support for Azerbaijan, which launched a military offensive in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region last year. The region had been under the control of Armenian separatists for decades.

“The response has been overwhelming,” Dzovinar Hatsakordzian, who organized the effort, said Tuesday.

The Armenian National Committee of America estimates that Michigan is home to about 72,000 Armenian Americans, including their family members and others close to the community. Hatsakordzian estimated that she had heard from at least 50 people who voted “uncommitted” to protest Biden’s support for Azerbaijan.

Biden allies point out that more than 10 percent of Democratic primary voters in Michigan marked their ballots “uncommitted” rather than voting for President Barack Obama when he ran for reelection in 2012 despite the absence of a protest campaign. They also say it’s impossible to know how many “uncommitted” voters are casting ballots because of anger at Biden.

“It could be the war,” said Mark Mellman, the president of Democratic Majority for Israel, which has backed Biden’s handling of the war. “It could be Azerbaijan. It could be concerns about Biden’s age. There could be myriad reasons that people are voting uncommitted.”

“Biden has 80 percent of the vote, while Trump has 66 percent at this point,” said Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.). “Trump is underperforming projections. But the press is only highlighting Biden's uncommitted votes.”

But the groups behind the “uncommitted” campaign hailed the vote as a victory and promised to fight on.

“We’ve thrown down a marker in Michigan,” Joseph Geevarghese, the executive director of Our Revolution, a group that grew out of Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign and backed the “uncommitted” effort — even though Sanders disavowed it — told reporters Tuesday night.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a member of the Biden campaign’s advisory board, said Tuesday night that Democrats need to listen to Michiganders if the president wants to carry the state in November.

“They’re saying that we need to make changes in foreign policy to earn back the trust of the community,” Khanna said. “And if we don't, I fear that we won't win the state.”

Biden tacitly acknowledged the work ahead in Michigan on Tuesday night.

“This fight for our freedoms, for working families, and for Democracy is going to take all of us coming together,” he said in a statement. “I know that we will.”

Democrats are leaning toward accepting a proposal from Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) to extend the first tranche of funding bills that expire at the end of the week until March 8 and to extend the rest of the bills — set to run out on March 8 — until March 22, averting a shutdown for now.

At the White House

Biden is expected to issue a sweeping executive order today that would prevent the bulk flow of Americans’ sensitive personal data — including genomic, geolocation and financial information — to buyers in “countries of concern,” particularly those in China, Russia and Iran.

Among other initiatives, the executive order directs the Departments of Health and Human Services, Defense and Veterans Affairs to ensure that federal grants, contracts and awards are not used to access Americans’ sensitive health data by countries of concern, including via companies in the United States, according to the White House.

“The sale of Americans’ data raises significant privacy, counterintelligence, blackmail risks and other national security risks — especially for those in the military or national security community,” the White House said in a statement.

On the Hill

Hunter Biden will sit for a closed-door deposition with the House Oversight and Judiciary committees today as part of Republicans’ impeachment probe into the president.

Republicans are expected to press the president’s son “on his role in allegedly selling the Biden ‘brand’ to score lucrative business deals abroad; his proclivity to invoke his family name in business negotiations; and whether any of the millions of dollars he earned from foreign business entities benefitted his father personally,” per ABC News’s Lucien Bruggeman

Hunter Biden’s appearance comes at a key moment in the investigation. Republicans have struggled to uncover evidence that the elder Biden benefited from his family’s business dealings. As our colleague Matt Viser noted last week, the committees have, in fact, “compiled an extensive record of sworn statements from firsthand witnesses saying the president was never involved.”

What’s more, the impeachment inquiry’s star witness — Alexander Smirnov — pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he lied to the FBI when he claimed to know that Joe Biden and his son took bribes.

Trump’s bump-stock ban to be argued before Supreme Court on Wednesday

Today, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for Garland v. Cargill, the second of two major gun cases before the justices this term.

At issue is whether a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is a machine gun and whether ATF officials properly interpreted the National Firearms Act, “a statute that has barred nonmilitary access to machine guns since 1986,” our colleague Ann E. Marimow writes.

The case centers on a 2018 federal ban on bump stocks ― enacted by the Trump administration after the devices were used in the 2017 mass killing on the Las Vegas Strip and calls for barring them intensified following the 2018 mass killing at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. “The bump stock ban represents one of the few steps by the federal government to address the mass killings that have become more frequent in the past decade, as both Congress and some courts have resisted efforts to place restrictions on firearms,” Ann writes.

“Michael Cargill, a U.S. Army veteran and the owner of a gun store in Austin, challenged the Trump-era rules after he was forced to surrender two bump stocks. Cargill says the [ATF] overstepped its authority when it reinterpreted longstanding federal limits on machine guns to cover the devices.”

“Cargill is represented by the , one of the conservative legal organizations that is also behind an effort to New Civil Liberties Alliance , one of the conservative legal organizations that is also behind an effort to upend a 40-year-old court precedent known as Chevron, which often requires judges to defer to the expertise of agency officials when evaluating statutes.”

This is not a Second Amendment case, but rather examines the reach of a federal statute. “Much of the discussion is likely to center on how a bump stock operates and whether its use amounts to a ‘single function of the trigger,’” Ann writes.

“The National Firearms Act defines machine guns as firearms that shoot, are designed to shoot or can be readily restored to shoot ‘automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger’ as well as any part designed and intended solely ‘for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun.’”

“Bump stocks are molded pieces of plastic or metal that replace the standard rifle stock that rests against a shooter’s shoulder. The device harnesses a gun’s natural recoil, allowing the rifle to bounce or ‘bump’ rapidly back and forth off a shooter’s trigger finger. Rifles equipped with bump stocks can fire an estimated 400 to 800 bullets per minute, a rate comparable to military machine guns, according to court filings.”

“The Biden administration, defending the Trump administration’s interpretation, told the court that the devices can be classified as machine guns because they are ‘designed and intended to permit users to convert a semiautomatic rifle so that the rifle can be fired continuously with a single pull of the trigger, discharging hundreds of bullets per minute.’”

Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Donald Trump’s presidential campaign moved quickly to tie the killing of a Georgia nursing student, allegedly by a Venezuelan migrant who entered the country illegally in 2022, to the surge of undocumented immigrants at the southern border under the Biden administration. His campaign posted a video that, with pounding music, combines news clips about the case with clips of Biden administration officials assuring people that the border was secure. It ends with the blunt message above.

Never mind that violent crime rates, especially for homicide in large cities, have fallen sharply during Biden’s presidency, after a surge during the pandemic. Trump, as he often did during his presidency, is using anecdotal evidence to make an emotional case against undocumented immigrants.

Trump is drawing on a long history of anti-immigrant rhetoric.

A 2020 study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed 200,000 congressional speeches and 5,000 presidential communications on immigration since 1880, when a wave of Chinese immigrants led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that barred Chinese laborers. When lawmakers spoke about immigration, their speeches were twice as likely as their speeches on other topics to mention words related to crime.

Moreover, the study found “stark differences” in how lawmakers discussed European and non-European groups, with “more implicitly dehumanizing metaphors” used to describe Chinese, Mexicans and other non-Europeans. “There is also a striking similarity in the use of explicit frames, with a greater emphasis on ‘crime,’ ‘labor,’ and ‘legality’ for the non-Europeans and less on ‘family,’ ‘contributions,’ ‘victims,’ and ‘culture,’” the study said.

Since the late 1970s, the study found a significant shift in the way Republicans talk about immigration; it is now as negative as it was in the 1920s, an era of strict immigration quotas. As for Trump, he was the first president whose immigration language was more negative than that of the average member of his own party.

But here’s the rub: There is little evidence that immigrants — or even undocumented immigrants — cause more crime. Still, there is enough ambiguity in the data — or so little hard data — that it’s difficult to point to conclusive findings that would change opinions.

“Many politicians, law enforcement personnel and ordinary citizens are nonetheless incensed because this person should not have been in the country and thus capable of committing a crime,” said Michael Light, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who has published several studies showing undocumented immigrants are not more crime-prone than native-born Americans. “This view that the person’s undocumented status is an aggravating factor is also likely a reason why these crimes generate such strong responses.”

Let’s try to separate fiction from fact.

How many undocumented immigrants are there?

This is uncertain now, though the number is a relatively small percentage of the U.S. population.

As of mid-2021, the Migration Policy Institute, a D.C. think tank that does research and analysis to improve immigration and integration policies, estimated from a U.S. census survey that there are 11.2 million undocumented immigrants. But that data has a two-year lag and does not capture the recent surge at the border.

Statistics from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Homeland Security Statistics indicate that since the start of February 2021, just after Biden took office, and the end of September 2023, about 3.1 million migrants came across the U.S.-Mexico border and have no confirmed departure from the United States. Another 357,000 people flew into the United States through the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan parole program. Also, an uncertain number of Ukrainian and Afghan refugees have entered the United States.

Moreover, we estimate that at least 1.6 million “got-aways” — people who were spotted by Border Control but were not captured — entered the country through September. (This estimate, which tracks with leaked internal administration data, assumes the Biden administration maintained a 78 percent apprehension rate, as previous administrations did.)

That adds up to 5 million more people since Biden took office, but it would be wrong to simply add that figure to 11.2 million. There is an overlap of about five months in 2021 and some unauthorized immigrants would have died, left the United States or possibly obtained legal status.

The United States has a population of about 330 million, so one can assume the undocumented share would be between 3.5 and 4.5 percent.

Immigrants tend to be more law-abiding

There is strong evidence that all immigrants — in the United States legally or otherwise — are more law-abiding than native-born American citizens. Most immigrants are motivated to do well in their new country, especially if they bring skills that can enhance local economies, and so there is little incentive to break the law.

Graham Ousey, a criminologist at the College of William & Mary, and Charis Kubrin, a criminologist at the University of California at Irvine, surveyed more than two decades of research on immigration and crime for their 2023 book, “Immigration and Crime: Taking Stock.” The results varied depending on survey design and scope, but generally they found “that long-standing concerns about immigration as a major source of crime are unfounded.” In fact, communities with more immigration tend to have less crime, especially violent crimes like homicide. They also found that immigrants are less involved in crime as both offenders and victims compared to the native-born, including the children of immigrants.

Similarly, the January update of a 2023 survey using census data led by Ran Abramitzky, a Stanford University economist, found that as a group, male immigrants over the last 150 years have had lower incarceration rates than people who were born in the United States — and that incarceration rates of immigrants have dropped since 1960.

Immigrant men today are 60 percent less liked to be incarcerated — a decline that occurred among immigrants from all regions — even though recent immigrants have characteristics associated with being snared by the criminal justice system, such as being younger, more likely not to be White, have lower incomes and are less educated. The study, however, notes that the relative decline might reflect “deeper structural forces disproportionately affecting low educated US-born men” rather than improvement by immigrants.

Little evidence undocumented immigrants commit more crime

The evidence becomes murkier when you try to drill down to crime by undocumented immigrants. Federal prisons record whether an immigrant is a noncitizen, but they are only a small fraction of the overall prison population. (About 140 law enforcement agencies in half of the states cooperate in a controversial U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement program to identify undocumented immigrants in their facilities for possible transfer to federal custody.) Only one state, Texas, records and keeps the immigration statuses of those entering the criminal justice system (more on that below), making it difficult to make broad conclusions.

Ousey and Kubrin, in their book, say that while there have been only a few studies focused on crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, the findings are consistent with the idea that immigrants do not commit more crimes than nonimmigrants. “Results from this small but growing literature are beginning to converge on the conclusion that fears about undocumented immigrants driving crime rates up are, essentially, unfounded,” they write.

One exception was a 2008 study that found a link between undocumented immigrants and identity theft. “The states with the highest ID theft rates tend to be those that have the highest percentages of undocumented immigrants,” the study said. Most of the identity-theft cases linked to undocumented immigrants involved a simple motive — the need to steal a Social Security number to hold a job and open a bank account in the United States.

Available data indicates that a relatively small percentage of undocumented immigrants have committed crimes (excluding the fact that they are in the country without authorization). As of September, DHS says, there were 6.2 million people on the “non-detained docket,” which means they live in the United States while their immigration cases are pending or removal is deferred for other reasons. Of that number, nearly 620,000, or 10 percent, have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges, according to data analyzed by the House Judiciary Committee. The nature of those crimes is not clear. (The FBI estimates that about 30 percent of the adult U.S. population has a criminal record, such as a felony arrest or conviction, though the figure also includes some misdemeanors.)

In 2015, the Migration Policy Institute estimated that a small percentage of undocumented immigrants had felony or serious misdemeanor convictions. About 3 percent had felony convictions and 4 percent had serious misdemeanor convictions. That’s lower than the overall population of the United States, where a 2017 study found that about 8 percent have felony convictions.

The dispute over Texas data

Both Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute and a team led by Light have delved deep into unique data on inmate immigration status maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. People arrested in Texas have their fingerprints sent to DHS to determine immigration status. But some people in the country illegally have never been encountered by authorities and thus their fingerprints are not on file. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice conducts a further investigation to determine whether someone in prison is in the country legally. The result is an unusually rich insight into the immigration status of people arrested and incarcerated in the state.

Nowrasteh, starting in 2018, wrote a series of reports that showed the conviction rates for serious crimes in Texas were much lower for undocumented immigrants than native-born Americans. Light, in a 2020 report, concluded that, in Texas, there are significantly lower felony arrest rates among undocumented immigrants compared to legal immigrants.

Their findings came under attack from the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration limits and a merit-based immigration system. CIS says that because the investigation into an inmate’s immigration status is ongoing, the data is not static and the number of undocumented immigrants rises over time. “Given sufficient time for data collection, it appears that illegal immigrants have above average conviction rates for homicide and sexual assault, while they have lower rates for robbery and drugs,” CIS said in 2022.

Nowrasteh told The Fact Checker some of this critique was correct, but said that CIS erred as well because some of the data it analyzed was double-counted. Some inmates were identified by DHS but then also included in the list provided by the Texas investigators, he said.

Nowrasteh on Wednesday published a new report that relied on fresh data on homicide convictions that he said eliminated double-counting. It confirmed that undocumented immigrants had a lower homicide conviction rate (2.4 per 100,000 undocumented immigrants) than native-born Americans (2.8 per 100,000). Legal immigrants had the lowest homicide conviction rate — 1.1 per 100,000 legal immigrants.

Steve Camarota, CIS research director, said the organization is “confident in our results.” Loann Garcia, senior director of the Texas crime records division, said in an email that “the data can get confusing as we have many ways to pull data,” so the results will change depending on how a researcher’s request is framed.

The battle over the numbers indicates how, with limited data to assess, the results can remain subject to dispute and interpretation.

The trial judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had already rejected Trump’s argument that he cannot be prosecuted for actions taken while he was in office, and his D.C. criminal trial had previously been scheduled to begin this coming Monday. In taking Trump’s case, however, the Supreme Court also ordered Wednesday that his trial continue to be placed on hold pending its final decision.

Democrats, as well as Republicans who served on the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol — in which a pro-Trump mob stormed the complex seeking to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s electoral win — expressed disappointment with the Supreme Court’s decision and its timing. They noted it would push Trump’s trial deeper into a critical election year.

“Delaying the January 6 trial suppresses critical evidence that Americans deserve to hear,” former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney, a Republican, wrote in a social media post that her fellow former GOP colleague Adam Kinzinger endorsed. “Donald Trump attempted to overturn an election and seize power. Our justice system must be able to bring him to trial before the next election. SCOTUS should decide this case promptly.”

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, posited that one of two things would happen in what he called an “epic self-test” for the Supreme Court: that the justices would “quickly follow clear precedent and constitutional text and dispense with the immunity argument 9-0 in time to permit the case to proceed” or that it would be “Bush v. Gore 2.0 with Republican justices stepping in to influence a presidential outcome by interfering in an ongoing prosecution.”

The Supreme Court set a fast-tracked schedule for the former president’s attorneys and special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecutors to file written arguments over the next seven weeks on this question: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.”

The high court is set to hear oral arguments in the case the week of April 22. All opinions are typically handed down by the last day of the court’s term in late June or early July before it recesses for the summer, meaning that Trump — who is marching toward the GOP presidential nomination — is not likely to face trial before summer at the earliest, if at all.

If the Supreme Court rejects his appeal in May or June and agrees that he can be prosecuted, a trial could be rescheduled to start in about six to 12 weeks, still before the 2024 election. But if the court requires the trial judge to parse immune conduct from nonimmune conduct, all bets are off. And if the high court returns the case to U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan in July, it would force the Justice Department to decide whether to press for a trial — one that is projected to last six to eight weeks — to start around Labor Day and go to a jury in October, with mail-in voting already underway.

“Maybe they [issue] the decision on April 23 and everything goes back to order, but maybe they dawdle on the decision for months and let Trump run out the clock on a properly indicted criminal case, not because of the merits but because they have intervened with delay,” Whitehouse told The Washington Post.

Trump cheered the decision Wednesday, posting on his social media network that unnamed legal scholars were “extremely thankful” that the Supreme Court was taking up his case.

“Without Presidential Immunity, a President will not be able to properly function, or make decisions, in the best interest of the United States of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

There is no deadline for Trump to face trial in D.C., but Smith has urged that the trial be held swiftly in the national interest — and Trump’s critics have argued that voters should have the benefit of knowing the judicial system’s verdict on Trump before Election Day. Trump has argued that voters should serve as his ultimate jury. If Trump is elected president in November, he could seek to end the prosecution.

Legal experts had conflicting opinions over whether the Supreme Court’s decision to hear Trump’s case could be considered “slow-walking” proceedings in favor of the former president.

“This is a momentous decision just to hear this case. There was no reason in this world for the Supreme Court to take this case,” J. Michael Luttig, a conservative jurist and former U.S. circuit judge, told MSNBC on Wednesday immediately upon hearing the news, adding that the three-judge panel on the D.C. appeals court had already written a “masterful opinion” denying Trump’s claims of absolute immunity.

“The Supreme Court is capable of deciding this very quickly, in time that the former president could be tried before the election,” Luttig added. “But today’s decision makes that that much more unlikely.”

Michael Waldman, president of New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, was adamant that the court was “moseying” needlessly. He noted that the 47 days that the court has allowed for both sides to file written arguments is longer than the period the court allowed in Trump v. Anderson earlier this year, a case centered on whether Trump should be barred from the ballot in Colorado if he engaged in insurrection. Lawyers had 31 days in the Colorado case.

“It’s slow-walking. There’s very few other ways, in my view, to interpret it,” Waldman told The Post on Thursday. “This appears to be the approach that helps Trump the most while appearing not to.”

Waldman suggested that the court would almost certainly still rule that Trump is not immune from prosecution.

“However, by dragging out the timeline, in reality they are making him immune from prosecution, before the election at least,” he said.

Waldman pointed out that in the past, the Supreme Court has handled other critical cases dealing with the presidency with much more alacrity. In 1974’s United States v. Nixon, for example, the court heard arguments and issued a decision in a matter of weeks. In 2000’s Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, heard oral arguments and issued a decision within days.

“This case is just as important, probably more important, than the Pentagon Papers case, or the [Watergate] tapes case,” Fred Wertheimer, president of the nonprofit watchdog group Democracy 21, said Wednesday. “If they wait and issue the opinion at the end of the term in June, they likely will have knowingly prevented voters from knowing if Trump is a convicted felon before they vote. They will have rewarded Trump’s delaying strategy at the enormous expense of the country and the Supreme Court.”

Jonathan Turley, a conservative attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School, argued that the Supreme Court — an institution “often criticized as moving at a glacial pace” — was in this case actually moving at “a NASCAR pace.” Turley also said he still believes Smith has the upper hand on the merits of the case.

“These cases on the state and federal level were brought after considerable delays,” Turley wrote in an email to The Post. “This case concerns actions taken almost four years ago. The Court did not create this potential collision with the presidential election. It has expedited the consideration of the case.”

In a post Wednesday to his Election Law Blog, legal scholar Rick Hasen said that he had assumed the long delay in Trump’s attempt to stay his criminal trial meant the Supreme Court was not going to grant it. Hasen also expressed doubt that, if the Supreme Court did not issue an opinion until late June, Trump would be put on trial during the general-election season.

“Early on, I called this federal election subversion case potentially the most important case in this Nation’s history,” Hasen wrote. “And now it may not happen because of timing, timing that is completely in the Supreme Court’s control. After all, this is the second time the Court has not expedited things to hear this case. This could well be game over.”

The Supreme Court decision should not affect Trump’s state criminal case in New York.

Trump is set to go to trial March 25 in state court in Manhattan on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in 2016, on the eve of that year’s presidential election.

The former president has raised a similar immunity defense in his separate federal criminal prosecution in Florida, and his separate state trial in Georgia — it is not yet clear how those issues could be affected by the Supreme Court’s decision.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Local and national party officials then negotiated a plan that would allow the Michigan GOP to award all its delegates despite the state’s new primary date.

“The Michigan Republican Party cut a deal with the RNC to come up with a hybrid system that allowed the general public to participate in a primary, which has been a strong tradition in Michigan and also hold a party convention on March 2 to select a majority of the delegates,” Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman, said in a statement to The Post.

Biden narrowly won Michigan in 2020, while Donald Trump carried it four years earlier.

Of Michigan’s 55 Republican delegates, 16 will be awarded based on the result of the primary on Tuesday. The remaining 39 delegates will be allocated based on caucuses that will take place at the nominating convention on Saturday.

Michigan has open primaries, meaning voters can cast a ballot in a party’s primary even if they are not a member of that party. But only Republican activists elected by their local parties can participate in the caucuses.

“I suspect former president Trump will win an overwhelming majority of delegates in Michigan,” Anuzis said of the hybrid contests.

Trump appeared on the Republican primary ballot, along with his last major challenger for the party’s nomination, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. Also on the ballot was Ryan Binkley, a wealthy pastor who has not garnered much support and dropped out Tuesday, and the names of several other candidates who previously suspended their campaigns.

President Biden appeared on the Democratic primary ballot, along with two other candidates: Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who has struggled to gain traction with voters and last week laid off campaign staffers, and author Marianne Williamson, who ended her campaign earlier this month.

Turmoil within the Michigan Republican Party threatened to complicate the hybrid nominating contests even further.

Trump and the RNC recognized former congressman Pete Hoekstra as the leader of the Michigan GOP in mid-February after the party voted the previous month to oust its embattled chair, election denier Kristina Karamo. But she has refused to give up the chairmanship title, and planned to gather supporters at a convention in Detroit on Saturday at the same time Hoekstra will lead a separate convention in Grand Rapids, Mich.

A judge ruled Tuesday that Karamo was no longer chair, but it was not immediately clear if she would go forward with her convention.

“I can’t call myself chairman because I’m not going to get into legal trouble, but we will not let this go,” Karamo told reporters after the ruling, adding that delegates were “aggrieved.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Republican senators struggle to answer tricky questions raised by the Alabama ruling

Senators are back on Capitol Hill for the first time since the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last week that frozen embryos are children and people can be liable for discarding or destroying them.

Republicans, urged by the National Republican Senatorial Committee to back in vitro fertilization, expressed support yesterday for the procedure. But they were harder to pin down on a sticky question raised by the Alabama ruling: What should be done with the many unused embryos created in the process?

Advertisement

Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) acknowledged he got “lambasted” last week for telling a reporter that he was “all for” the court’s decision, while in the same breath saying people “need to have more kids.”

Tuberville said he has since done his research and maintained that everyone should have the “opportunity” to have a child. He noted that five of the eight IVF clinics in Alabama remain open. However, he dodged questions about the court decision.

“There’s a lot of experimentation, you know, with embryos, and they’re trying to get to the bottom of how do we do this the right way,” he said, without clarifying who “they” is. Tuberville added that the Alabama legislature plans to vote on a bill to protect IVF.

Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), an OB/GYN, called IVF “a miracle.” But when asked whether unused embryos should be destroyed — the central issue in the Alabama case — he demurred.

“The great thing about the Dobbs decision is that puts the power back into ‘We the People’ and the legislature there needs to address the situation,” Marshall said, adding that he “fully supports” IVF in Kansas.

Political considerations

In vitro fertilization, which is enormously popular, is more often used by college-educated women – a voter demographic Republicans need in 2024, especially if they want to keep control of the House. Ever since the Supreme Court struck down the federal right to an abortion, Republicans have struggled to coalesce around positions on reproductive rights issues.

Since the Alabama ruling, which has so far resulted in the closure of nearly half the state’s IVF clinics, Democrats have been quick to point out Republicans’ history of signing on to anti-IVF legislation.

In 2021, before the overturn of Roe v. Wade, 166 of 215 House Republicans backed a bill by Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) that defined personhood at the moment of conception, with no protection for IVF.

Seven of the nine Republicans in the House at the time who represented districts that President Biden won in 2020 supported the bill. (Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Young Kim of California did not.)

But two years later, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe and Democrats successfully ran on abortion in the midterms, fewer Republicans — 125 — backed a new version of the bill.

Reps. Don Bacon (Neb.), Mike Garcia (Calif.), David G. Valadao (Calif.) and David Schweikert (Ariz.) did not sign on to it. Twelve freshman Republicans elected to Biden districts didn’t sign on either. The only Republican in a Biden district who signed on in 2023 was Rep. Michelle Steel (Calif.), who also supported it in 2021.

Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), who signed on to the Life at Conception Act as a House member last Congress, said he supports both IVF and the belief that life begins at conception. However, he said “there are other complexities” when asked what to do with unused frozen embryos.

Emma Waters, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, warned last year that there was “no such thing as a ‘fundamental right’ to a child per se, and it certainly can’t be invoked to trump the basic rights of others.”

On the Hill

The issue of IVF is playing a role in the stalemate over government funding bills, even as a partial government shutdown looms at the end of the week. One sticking point had been a policy in the military construction-veterans affairs bill in which Democrats wanted to expand access to fertility treatments, including IVF.

Democrats are also seizing the moment to push forward on stand-alone legislation protecting IVF. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) will push for her bill to move forward this week.

She had both of her children via IVF but says she wasted years after going to a doctor she didn’t realize was known for counseling against IVF for religious reasons, has been warning about efforts to restrict IVF since the 2018 nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

“If a fertilized egg is a person, then you run into all sorts of risks in terms of birth control. IUDs would become illegal. Many fertility treatments would become illegal,” she said at the time.

Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), who is running for reelection in a district Biden barely won in 2020, reintroduced the House version of the bill last month. It has drawn more than 30 Democratic co-sponsors since the Alabama ruling, including Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who is running for Senate in a competitive race. Wild is set to hold a news conference with several new co-sponsors on Thursday.

What we're watching

The campaign

Today is the Michigan primary.

On the Republican side, we’re watching how Nikki Haley does in the third primary in which she has faced former president Donald Trump one-on-one. Trump defeated Haley by 11 points in New Hampshire last month and by 20 points in South Carolina on Saturday.

Advertisement

(Confusingly, most of Michigan’s 55 delegates won’t be chosen until Saturday at the state’s Republican convention.)

On the Democratic side, we’re keeping an eye on how many voters mark their ballots “uncommitted” rather than casting a ballot for President Biden or Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.).

A group called Listen to Michigan has been trying to persuade at least 10,000 Democrats to vote “uncommitted” to protest Biden’s support for Israel and his refusal to call for a cease-fire in Gaza, our colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb and Isaac Arnsdorf wrote last week.

But Michiganders can vote “uncommitted” for whatever reasons they like — more than 19,000 people voted “uncommitted” in the 2020 Democratic primary — so it might be hard to know how many of those votes were meant to criticize Biden’s support for Israel.

On the Hill

Biden will meet with the four congressional leaders this morning to discuss both stalled government funding talks and aid to Ukraine.

Advertisement

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has resisted an agreement on both government funding and holding a vote on Ukraine aid because of demands by the far-right faction of his party. He will be outnumbered as every other leader is a strong backer of Ukraine aid. We’re watching to see if the meeting moves the needle on either issue.

The campaign

They renounced Trump. Will they get fellow conservatives to vote Biden?

Our colleague Kara Voght takes a look at a group of Republican women that have two things in common: They all worked in the Trump White House, and they’re all working to prevent him from winning a second term.

Sarah Matthews, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Cassidy Hutchinson “represent the last wave of the anti-Trump movement — what you might call Now-Never Trumpers (or, maybe, the Better-Late-Than-Never Trumpers),” Kara writes. “They’re conservatives who were for Trump before they were against him, and for whom the former president’s reckless behavior after losing the 2020 election was a breaking point.”

Farah Griffin, who served as a White House communication director for President Donald Trump in 2020, departed first, that December. Matthews, Trump’s former deputy press secretary, quit immediately after the U.S. Capitol riot. Hutchinson, the former aide to Mark Meadows when he was Trump’s chief of staff, served through the end of Trump’s term but later gave explosive testimony to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Kara writes.

“They are among dozens of former Trump officials who have criticized the conduct of their former boss. Those who saw him up close have called the former president a ‘wannabe dictator’ (former Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley ), ‘a consummate narcissist’ (former attorney general William P. Barr ), and a ‘moron’ (former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , Axios — would be less dangerous to the country than a second Biden administration. Voting for Biden, the outlet quoted him as saying during a speech in Florida, would constitute ‘outright national suicide.’” who have criticized the conduct of their former boss. Those who saw him up close have called the former president a ‘wannabe dictator’ (former Joint Chiefs chairman), ‘a consummate narcissist’ (former attorney general), and a ‘moron’ (former Secretary of State reportedly ). But Barr reportedly has suggested that a second Trump administration — which he likened to ‘playing Russian roulette with the country,’ according to— would be less dangerous to the country than a second Biden administration. Voting for Biden, the outlet quoted him as saying during a speech in Florida, would constitute ‘outright national suicide.’”

“Which raises a question: Just how serious are some of the anti-Trump Republicans about keeping him out of the Oval Office? Serious enough that these dissenting former officials would actually vote for Biden?”

In the agencies

The economy is roaring. Immigration is a key reason.

The U.S. job market owes much of its growth to immigration, which helped “cement the country’s economic rebound from the pandemic as the most robust in the world,” our colleagues Rachel Siegel, Lauren Kaori Gurley and Meryl Kornfield report.

“That momentum picked up aggressively over the past year. About 50 percent of the labor market’s extraordinary recent growth came from foreign-born workers between January 2023 and January 2024, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis of federal data. And even before that, by the middle of 2022, the foreign-born labor force had grown so fast that it closed the labor force gap created by the pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco .” About 50 percent of the labor market’s extraordinary recent growth came from foreign-born workers between January 2023 and January 2024, according to ananalysis of federal data.

“Immigrant workers also recovered much faster than native-born workers from the pandemic’s disruptions, and many saw some of the largest wage gains in industries eager to hire. Economists and labor experts say the surge in employment was ultimately key to solving unprecedented gaps in the economy that threatened the country’s ability to recover from prolonged shutdowns.”

When Hunter Biden came to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to answer questions from legislators and investigators working on the impeachment inquiry targeting his father, he was presented with a number of those assertions.

In each case, he offered credible responses. You can read them below, in his own words.

What emerges when reading the transcript of the interview is how dependent the Republican effort is on three tactics. You’ll see those play out in the rebuttals Hunter Biden offered, but it’s useful to articulate them specifically.

First and most obvious is that cherry-picking. Republicans have gained access to countless financial and personal documents involving the Bidens and business associates of Hunter Biden and James Biden, the president’s brother. Sifting through that material like amateur internet sleuths, they’ve picked out a dozen or so things that might be framed as suspicious. This is how all investigations work, of course, with a few clues scattered among a lot of distractions. But when the allegations include such things as Joe Biden showing up at a dinner involving his son and a business partner, the frequency of his joining his son for dinner matters.

Advertisement

This is the second point: Republicans are trying to weaponize the schmoozing that politicians do. The allegations of Joe Biden meeting Hunter Biden’s partners centers on things like shaking hands at a reception or Hunter Biden’s associates being invited to White House events.

Third, the allegations center on two key conflations. The first and better known is using “the Biden family” as a proxy for “Hunter and James Biden.” Claiming that Hunter Biden’s income was going to “the Biden family” is a way to loop in the president unfairly. The same thing happens with “payments.” At times, the money involved in Hunter Biden’s transactions are for investments, not for his own benefit.

Those tactics in mind, here are the allegations that Republicans have made (in bold and with examples) and distillations of Hunter Biden’s rebuttals, including direct quotes from the transcript.

Hunter Biden flew with his father on Air Force Two to have him help close a deal in China. Biden had coffee with that partner, Jonathan Li. (example)

Hunter Biden said he traveled with his father many times. Reading an excerpt from his book, he said he did so to allow his daughter to spend time with her grandfather. In China, he met a friend with whom he’d later go into business. The friend shook hands with Joe Biden in a reception line.

The claim about coffee came from Devon Archer, who wasn’t there; Hunter Biden and Li went for coffee after the reception line.

“My father shaking Jonathan Li’s hand in a rope line in a hotel had nothing to do with my relationship with him. I had an over 10-year relationship with Jonathan Li. He was a friend, and he was also a very astute businessperson. He was educated in London, and we have become, not just friends, but I trusted him to be a very capable businessperson.”

“My father had absolutely no knowledge of, no involvement in, had no awareness of my business relationship with Jonathan Li.”

Joe Biden wrote a letter of recommendation for Li’s son. (example)

He did.

“Jonathan, as I said before, was a very close friend, became a close friend of mine. … There was a rule in my family, my dad was often asked to write recommendations for hundreds of people that — I’m sure over the course of the last 50 years. But the rule was is that, if you were going to ask, that they had to be close friends; you had to know them well. And I knew both Jonathan, and I knew his son, who was applying to universities here in the United States.”

Hunter Biden repeatedly put his father on speakerphone during business meetings. (example)

Because of the tragedies in the Biden family, both Hunter and Joe Biden would take calls from family members whenever they were received. Sometimes, that was during meetings. Joe Biden did not contribute to any discussion about business partnerships.

Advertisement

“In our family, when you have a call from — I call him or he calls me or I call one of my — his grandkids or one of my children, you always pick up the phone. It’s something that we always do.”

“Devon, I think, what did he testify? That over the course of our 10-year relationship I was — maybe 10 or 20 times that he can remember. He can’t recall the specific times that I put my dad on speakerphone when I was at a dinner or at a social event, so that means, over the course of 10 years, twice a year, my dad would call me, and I would be in the middle of a dinner, and I always answer his call. I always answer his call, based upon my life’s experience. And you’re telling me, so two times a year over the course of a 10 years, maybe more, or 15 years with Devon Archer, yes, that probably did happen.”

“I’m surprised my dad hasn’t called me right now, and if he did, I would put him on speakerphone to say hi to you and to Congressman Raskin and everybody else in the room.”

Hunter Biden introduced his father to business partners during dinner meetings in Washington. (example)

The restaurant where these two meetings were held is called Cafe Milano and sits roughly between the White House and the vice-presidential residence. His father would at times join him if he was eating dinner there. The meetings in question were centered on- Hunter Biden’s work for the World Food Program and a birthday celebration.

“I’ve had dozens of dinners at Cafe Milano for dozens — for many, many different reasons, whether it was just to be with family or whether it was to be with friends or whether it was to be with friends and associates or whether it was to do, for instance, a dinner that was a presentation for the U.S./U.N. World Food Program. And, in one of the occasions that you’re speaking about, the entire purpose of the dinner was to present, and there was a big screen at the end of the room. I got up and made a presentation.”

“I think another dinner you’re talking about was actually on my actual birthday, and my dad stopped by because it was my actual birthday.”

“If my mom wasn’t there or if my mom was home in Delaware, he would, you know, stop and have a bowl of spaghetti with me or whoever I was sitting with.”

One of the people at one of those dinners, Yelena Baturina, later paid Hunter Biden millions of dollars. Another attendee bought him a car. (example)

Baturina did attend a dinner, but did not give Hunter Biden any money. That investment was with Archer and went to the purchase of buildings in New York, as Archer testified.

The car, Hunter Biden said, was bought by Archer, who was working with a Kazakh businessman named Kenes Rakishev.

“I had nothing to do with Rosemont-whatever entity, the realty or whatever it is. That was Devon’s. I never received a dime from Ms. Baturina. I didn’t have any involvement with her in any way.”

“Kenes Rakishev was a guest at the dinner that I had for the presentation about the World Food Program. My dad stopped by. I never did anything on behalf of Kenes Rakishev or asked anyone to do anything on behalf of Kenes Rakishev.”

A $40,000 check to Joe Biden was money that had come from a deal involving a Chinese company. (example)

Hunter Biden and his uncle were partners in a venture that saw Hunter pay James Biden for his work. James Biden later paid back a loan that Joe Biden had extended him. (The Washington Post has seen documentation of the original loan.)

“This is the most ridiculous thing that — I mean, so far. Are you saying to me, do I understand the fungibility of dollars?”

“You’re saying that, because I paid my uncle from a Delaware corporation that was fully transparent as to the purpose of that corporation, that had a business partner that happened to be from China, and then that money moved over into my Owasco PC account, which didn’t just have that money but had other money in it, you’re acting as if there’s, like, a dollar here that somehow was traced all the way down to here to repay a loan that you guys say that my father made to him.”

Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma came despite his lack of experience. (example)

The value to Burisma came from Hunter Biden’s experience as a lawyer working on corporate governance issues. He’d been encouraged to join the board by the president of Poland, who viewed Burisma as an important bulwark against Russia in the wake of the seizing of Crimea in 2014.

“They became a client of mine initially at Boies Schiller Flexner. And in that time I asked them, because I wanted to do a background and security check on them to make certain that they are who they say they were.”

“I would like you to understand what a board is. If you look at any board, most boards do not pick board members that are necessarily members of the particular industry in which they are in. What they do is they pull from different areas in which there is a need. They didn’t need anyone to tell them about how to drill natural gas. What they needed someone to do is to be able to help them with oversight and accountability and to do corporate governance.”

Hunter Biden called his father to get him to relieve investigatory pressure on Burisma. (example)

Every part of this is disputed. Hunter Biden says he didn’t call his father; Archer suggested he did before admitting he wasn’t privy to such a call. There was no known investigation into Burisma that needed to be addressed; in fact, Burisma viewed Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor general, as an asset. Joe Biden and others in the international community were already calling for the ouster of Shokin. Joe Biden was already planning to travel to Ukraine at the time of the purported call.

In his response, Hunter Biden invoked the name of Alexander Smirnov, charged last month by the Justice Department with having invented a story about the Bidens being bribed.

“There is not a single person other than Alexander Smirnov who says that Shokin, that Shokin was fired because I was on the board of Burisma. It’s literally the exact opposite, and that has been a fact now since it was first claimed.”

“The one thing also to make absolutely clear is I never spoke to my dad about it. Never had any discussions with him about it, because the only honest — the only thing that would be of value here would be for Viktor Shokin to stay in place, not the opposite.”

An email suggesting that money be held for the “big guy” indicates that Joe Biden had a financial stake in a deal. (example)

The email was written by a third party who was speculating that maybe Joe Biden could get involved. Hunter Biden said that he didn’t remember seeing the email but that he would have rejected the idea out of hand if he had. The consummated deal did not include Joe Biden.

This was bolstered by text exchanges between that man and Tony Bobulinski, who was very briefly an associate of Hunter Biden’s. One message suggested they “get the company set up” and then “tell H and family the high stakes and get Joe involved.”

“James [Gilliar] is probably, like, wow, wouldn’t be great if a former vice president could be in our business together? ”

“If I had seen it, I’m certain that what I would have done is I would have picked up the phone and said, ‘You’re out of your mind.’ ”

“I told Tony literally weeks after I met him that he was out of his mind, that he was going around, trying to promote the idea that my dad was somehow going to be involved in this. And that’s why I never did business with Tony.”

A message from Hunter Biden referring to “my chairman” was a reference to his father. (example)

Hunter Biden and his business partners were each working with one of two Chinese business executives, each of whom was referred to as chairman. This is a reference to the chairman with whom Hunter was working.

“Tony and James were talking to Zhang. I was talking to Ye, which is one of the conflicting things between us to begin with. That’s the chairman I’m referring to.”

“Now, you have my answer under oath that I did not refer and never have referred to my father as ‘chairman’.”

In one message, Hunter Biden tried to pressure a business partner by noting that his father was sitting next to him. (example)

Biden testified that, if legitimate, the message was apparently sent when he was intoxicated, since he sent it to the wrong person. He insisted that his father was not with him when it was sent.

“I am more embarrassed of this text message, if it actually did come from me, than any text message I’ve ever sent. The fact of the matter is, is that there’s no other text message that you have in which I say anything remotely to this. And I was out of my mind. I can also tell you this: My father was not sitting next to me. My father had no awareness. My father had no awareness of the business that I was doing. My father never benefited from any of the business that I was doing.”

Hunter Biden sought out a shared space for him and his father to do business. (example)

Biden says that this occurred during the worst period of his addiction and that he hoped to demonstrate that the family could go back to normal. There ultimately was no shared space.

“My lease was up for renewal, and they were not going to renew my lease. And I said to them, ‘Look, I’m not going to be the sole person that’s in this. I want it for the Biden Foundation, and this could be an office space. It was a beautiful office space. It can be for my mom and my dad.’ ”

There were other issues presented to Hunter Biden, but those didn’t centrally allege wrongdoing by his father. This was the intent of the hearing after all — and as Biden and his attorney had to remind Republicans at times — not to tear down Hunter Biden but to show how Joe Biden allegedly benefited from these business deals.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived at a midtown Manhattan law firm’s office on a summer night in 2000 ready for a fight. His adversary was not one of the polluters he had spent years driving from the Hudson River. It was his mentor, friend and boss, the renowned environmentalist Robert H. Boyle.

Boyle had helped Kennedy rehabilitate himself, personally and professionally, after an arrest for heroin possession in 1983 at the age of 29. But now the two men were locked in a power struggle for control of Riverkeeper, the group that Boyle founded and where Kennedy had built a career as a crusading environmental attorney.

Their battle at that night’s board meeting was over Kennedy’s push to hire a staff scientist who had just been released from federal prison. His crime: running an international wildlife smuggling ring that prosecutors said had damaged rare bird populations.

Boyle argued that employing such a figure at one of New York’s premier environmental organizations was like hiring a robber as a bank teller. Kennedy was equally insistent that the man be brought on.

By the time Riverkeeper’s board adjourned that night, Kennedy had won, leading Boyle and seven other directors to resign. It was a pivotal moment for the group — whose board would henceforth be dominated by the faction of celebrities and socialites who had backed Kennedy — and for Boyle, who never recovered emotionally from what he saw as his former protégé’s betrayal, according to people close to him.

Above all it was a crucial victory for Kennedy, who for the next two decades would indelibly merge his public profile with that of Riverkeeper, eventually claiming — falsely — that he had co-founded the organization. He would frequently invoke his bona fides as a warrior for New York’s waterways as he took up anti-vaccine activism, the cause he is most associated with today.

Kennedy’s detractors often divide his career into two phases: a laudable period as a workhorse of the environmental movement and a swerve into the conspiracist worldview that defines his independent bid for the White House.

But a close examination of Kennedy’s early years as a lawyer in the Hudson Valley shows that the same qualities that today inspire his supporters and alarm his critics — obstinacy, an itch to challenge authority, a mastery of scientific minutiae that is paradoxically coupled with a loose allegiance to facts — were causing controversy long before he trained his sights on Bill Gates or Anthony S. Fauci.

No episode was more remarkable than the schism Kennedy precipitated at Riverkeeper, a sprawling melodrama starring a political dynasty’s prodigal son, a secretive circle of master falconers and a network of daring cockatoo egg smugglers whose reach extended from Western Australia to New Paltz, N.Y.

The feud’s details may have seemed outlandish, but the fallout was concrete. Boyle, who literally wrote the book on the Hudson River (title: “The Hudson River”), spent his last years in self-imposed exile — unable, according to his children, to bear looking at a body of water that reminded him of Kennedy. He died in 2017 in Cooperstown, N.Y., more than 100 miles from the valley where he did his life’s work.

“He felt like somebody who had been the victim of a carjacking,” said his son Alex Boyle, 61. “He felt it was a form of betrayal.”

Kennedy, who retired from Riverkeeper several years ago, said in an interview that he had not done anything improper by hiring a former wildlife smuggler at the group. On the contrary, he said, it would have been wrong to deny someone employment simply because of a criminal record.

But though he believes he was right to stand up to Boyle, he lamented the consequences for their relationship.

“Bob still abides as one of the great heroes of the environmental movement and one of my personal heroes,” Kennedy said. “It was kind of heartbreaking.”

Alexander Zagoreos, a former Riverkeeper treasurer who resigned from the board with Boyle in 2000, said Kennedy had a disconcerting tendency even then to persuade people by eliding, distorting or simply ignoring facts that got in his way.

Today, he worries that Kennedy is using the same abilities to garner support for a presidential candidacy based on conspiracy theories about the U.S. government and debunked arguments against lifesaving vaccines. Recent polls show that Kennedy garners the support of about 1 in 5 voters.

“You have to be concerned about that, especially if somebody like that has a lot of power,” Zagoreos said.

The Kennedy he sees and hears today on the campaign trail, he said, is no different from the one whose actions split Riverkeeper on that night 24 years ago.

“Who the man is now,” Zagoreos said, “I think a lot of it started there.”

Redemption on the river

On Sept. 11, 1983, Kennedy was found sick and disoriented in the lavatory of an airplane on its way to Rapid City, S.D. It would later emerge that he was traveling to the Black Hills to seek treatment for drug addiction, but his decision came too late to avert scandal. He was greeted at the airport by paramedics and police, who discovered that he was carrying a small amount of heroin.

Kennedy was charged with heroin possession, punishable by up to two years in prison. It was a low point for the young man, who had struggled with drug abuse since his teenage years — lived in the shadow of the assassinations of first his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, and then his father, former attorney general Robert F. Kennedy.

“I had accepted as a child a very religious moral code which forbade dishonesty, and illegal activities in general,” Kennedy later wrote in “The Riverkeepers,” a book on the movement to clean up the Hudson River that he co-authored with environmental activist John Cronin. “The addiction increasingly challenged my capacity to live up to my values and the dictates of my conscience.”

In 1984, a judge sentenced Kennedy to two years’ probation. Abandoning his former career path as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he entered rehab and eventually began working on a former estate in the Hudson Valley to fulfill his community service requirement. There he encountered the Hudson River Fishermen’s Association, later renamed Riverkeeper, which was setting up its office in a farmhouse on the grounds.

Founded in 1966 by Boyle, an ornery ex-Marine and Sports Illustrated writer, the association was running a kind of guerrilla campaign to clean up one of the most despoiled waterways in North America. A river that in the 19th century had been synonymous with bucolic landscape paintings was dotted with power plants and fouled by raw sewage.

By the time Kennedy arrived, the fishermen had notched impressive legal victories against corporations including Exxon and Con Edison and used settlement money to build a private patrol boat, Riverkeeper, in which Cronin cruised the Hudson seeking environmental scofflaws.

Kennedy began volunteering with the association, and in 1985 he worked extensively on cases against more than a dozen polluters of Quassaick Creek in Newburgh, N.Y. The offenders were forced to pay $200,000 toward a fund to improve the creek, marking what Kennedy later called “my first successes as an environmental attorney.”

In 1987, he co-founded an environmental litigation clinic at Pace Law School that worked primarily on cases for Riverkeeper. John Humbach, a former Pace law professor and associate dean, said Kennedy quickly became famous among students as a dazzling instructor.

“They were just superb sessions. His students were extremely engaged. He was extremely engaged,” Humbach said.

Kennedy also had a more far-reaching fame, of course, and Humbach said the law school’s reputation — and the prominence of the Hudson River as an environmental cause — benefited from it.

“At one point I remember sitting in his office talking to him. He said, ‘I can get on the phone and call up’ — he mentioned some civil rights leader at the time — ‘and they’ll pick up the phone,’” Humbach recalled. “He said, ‘I have these abilities, and I want to put them to work to get some good result out of them.’”

Yet within Riverkeeper, not all were as smitten with their new celebrity litigator.

Robert Boyle’s son Alex Boyle, then 22, was among the volunteers who helped collect samples from a polluted tributary of Quassaick Creek. He said Kennedy was initially friendly but one day went on a furious tirade in which he falsely accused the younger man of inappropriately labeling sample jars.

After that, Alex Boyle said, he was wary of Kennedy — and warned others to be as well.

“I said to my father, ‘You have a pet rattlesnake,’” he recalled. “‘Eventually he’s going to bite you.’”

Enter the cockatoo

By the late 1990s, Riverkeeper was prospering, thanks in no small part to Kennedy’s ability to court donors. Zagoreos, the former treasurer and board member, estimated that the group’s annual fundraising haul quintupled after Kennedy joined. He also recruited board members far outside Riverkeeper’s original orbit of commercial fishermen and grass-roots environmental activists, including actors Alec Baldwin and Lorraine Bracco.

In 1997, Cronin and Kennedy published “The Riverkeepers.” Although the book credited Robert Boyle’s foundational role, the older man felt he had been upstaged, and his relationship to his lieutenants “changed dramatically,” Kennedy said.

“He just became very hostile,” Kennedy said. “Let me put it this way: Bob Boyle was always a curmudgeon, and that was part of his charm. And he became increasingly charming with age.”

Cronin, who left Riverkeeper in 1999, declined to comment for this story.

A year after the book’s publication, Boyle and Kennedy clashed over Kennedy’s desire to start a bottled water company, using the Riverkeeper name, whose profits would go to environmental causes. Boyle persuaded the board to dismiss the proposal, but hard feelings lingered. Fletcher Hodges, who took over the group’s day-to-day operations after Cronin’s departure, said Kennedy regularly skipped staff meetings.

“Everything that Bobby Kennedy did at Riverkeeper was about Bobby Kennedy and not about Riverkeeper,” Hodges, now 90, said in an interview. “I thought he was a liability.”

The breaking point came in November 1999, when Kennedy hired an employee at Riverkeeper named William Wegner. Kennedy described him as a skilled scientist, but Riverkeeper had not been looking for a scientist. As Boyle later described it, he became suspicious — and then horrified — as he began digging into Wegner’s background.

Wegner, then 49, had been released from federal prison just a few months earlier, after serving about 3½ years of a five-year sentence for tax fraud, perjury and conspiracy to violate wildlife protection laws. The charges all sprang from his roughly decade-long run as the alleged kingpin of a smuggling ring that trafficked in Australian cockatoos.

According to prosecutors, Wegner recruited a team of at least 10 “mules” who raided tree hollows in Australia to steal the birds’ eggs. The mules incubated the eggs using Styrofoam and hair dryers and then hid their contraband in special vests as they flew back to the United States. If the eggs hatched en route, Wegner’s couriers had instructions to flush the chicks down the airplane toilet.

The birds that survived were sold for $1,500 to $12,500 apiece to American collectors, who were willing to pay a premium on the black market for animals that were illegal to export from Australia. Investigators estimated the operation generated $1.5 million over about eight years. Wegner managed the sales through outlets including an associate’s business in New Paltz, Planned Parrothood, and a trailer in Malibu, where he tried without success to sell a screenplay about bird smuggling.

“It was a very calculated undertaking that he did, with quite a bit of hubris,” said former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent Robert Jarmuz, who led the investigation and personally arrested Wegner. “He ruined the lives of many people along the way that were impressionable and younger.”

Wegner, now 73, did not respond to requests for comment.

Boyle was livid when he learned about Wegner’s past and ordered that he be fired. Kennedy objected, taking his case to the board. Among other things, he argued that Wegner was an experienced scientist who would come cheap because of his inability to find other work and that his crimes had involved birds so common in Australia they were considered agricultural pests.

Kennedy made the same points in a recent interview with The Washington Post.

“Every species that he smuggled was a vermin species that the Australian government was paying people to destroy,” he said.

Records from the investigation tell a different story.

In a 1994 memorandum that Jarmuz shared with The Post, federal prosecutors anticipated that Wegner’s defense attorneys would similarly argue that because one of the species his mules smuggled — the rose-breasted cockatoo — was abundant, his actions were “at least morally defensible.”

However, prosecutors stated: “These arguments are either untrue or irrelevant. Of the seven species at issue, several are genuinely rare and probably endangered in Australia.” (Today at least three of the species targeted by Wegner’s ring are listed as endangered by the Australian government.) The rose-breasted variety “is indeed common in Australia,” prosecutors added, “but farmers may not kill the birds without express permission from the Parks department, which is difficult to obtain.”

Kennedy told The Post that Wegner, before his arrest, had worked on river issues for two environmental consulting firms in the Hudson Valley. Spokespeople for those firms said they did not have personnel records dating back that far and could not verify his employment.

However, the 1994 prosecutors’ memorandum states that during the 10-year period covered by the investigation, “Wegner held no job and no source of income except for the money he earned selling cockatoos.” Jarmuz, who subpoenaed Wegner’s Internal Revenue Service records, said he never saw evidence that Wegner worked in jobs similar to those Kennedy described.

“He was living kind of a bohemian lifestyle,” Jarmuz said.

But Wegner pursued another vocation along with smuggling. And in it lay the key to why Kennedy was determined to find him a job, even if it meant tearing Riverkeeper apart.

‘My devotion to raptors’

When he was a child, Kennedy has written, his interest in wildlife begot a dizzying menagerie at his family’s Hickory Hill estate in Northern Virginia, including lizards, frogs, snakes, starlings, sparrows, pigeons, field mice, rats, raccoons, squirrels, possums and a giant tortoise that the young Kennedy had captured while on safari in Kenya with his aunt’s husband, founding Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver.

But there was one kind of animal that fired his imagination above all others. Inspired by the Camelot mythology attached to his father and uncle, Kennedy read “The Once and Future King” by T.H. White and was mesmerized by its descriptions of falconry, the practice of capturing wild raptors and using them to hunt smaller birds or mammals.

At age 14, after his father’s assassination, Kennedy began boarding at the elite Millbrook School in the Hudson Valley, where he fell in with “a tight-knit cadre of boys who shared my devotion to raptors,” he wrote in a 2007 column in Vanity Fair. Through the turmoil of the ensuing years he kept up his hawking, and when he returned to the valley in 1984 he reconnected with its community of dedicated falconers.

Among them was Wegner. Kennedy said he and Wegner hunted with hawks together for years but never grew particularly close.

“We weren’t friends,” he said in an interview. “I mean, we’re friends in terms of — you know, I’m kind of a friend with anyone who’s flying a hawk. You have an instant basis for friendship.”

The men nevertheless had an important connection through a close mutual friend and fellow Hudson Valley falconer, Thomas Cullen III. Cullen, whom Kennedy described to The Post as “one of my best friends,” appears in a November 2023 campaign video about the presidential candidate’s love of falconry.

Cullen himself is no stranger to ornithology’s criminal underbelly. In 1984, he was arrested by Australian authorities, who alleged he had been climbing a tree with a hatchet in a wildlife sanctuary in Western Australia, trying to steal eggs from a cockatoo’s nesting hollow. He pleaded guilty to charges in Australia and paid a fine.

Cullen was never charged by U.S. officials in connection with Wegner’s smuggling conspiracy, which according to federal records involved several falconers from the Hudson Valley. But in 2006, Cullen was sentenced to four months in prison and a $1,000 fine for importing black sparrow hawks in violation of the Wild Bird Conservation Act and making false statements to the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Kennedy has never been implicated in illegal activity involving birds or other wildlife and said Cullen never discussed smuggling schemes with him. But they talked about many other things on their autumn expeditions to capture wild hawks, and Kennedy said he probably learned of Wegner’s 1999 release from prison during one of these forays.

“I was going hunting with Tom, at that point, every weekend,” Kennedy recalled. “We would sit up on hills all day long, for 10 hours. And, you know, we’d talk about falcons and falconers.”

From Cullen, he added, “I would have known what Bill [Wegner] was doing” as he sought to get back on his feet.

Approached at his home in Goshen, N.Y. (“The Eyrie,” reads a sign in the driveway), Cullen, 72, declined to comment. So did his wife, Peggy Cullen, a former member of Riverkeeper’s board.

Their 36-year-old son, Thomas Cullen IV — also a master falconer — would not discuss the details of the elder Cullen’s criminal history. However, he said the 1980s and 1990s were a dark time among practitioners of their ancient hobby, and that many felt they were the victims of overly zealous enforcement actions by wildlife protection agents.

“Back in those days, the federal government was convinced that bird people were as bad as drug people, thinking we were running this huge cabal of illegal smuggling,” he said. “And that just wasn’t the case at all.”

The younger Cullen took a Post reporter on a tour of The Eyrie’s basement, where more than a dozen magnificent birds of prey perched, shuffling their gleaming talons as they glared at the intruder. Cullen pointed out his Harris’s hawks — rust-colored Southwestern birds that hunt in packs, like wolves — some of which he said were descended from one of Kennedy’s hawks.

A gyrfalcon in the bunch was the offspring of a raptor owned by Wegner, he added.

Cullen acknowledged the spiritual kinship among falconers, sometimes matched by literal kinship among their birds. But he said he did not think Kennedy did anything wrong by helping out another member of their avian fraternity.

“All it came down to is Bobby gave someone a second chance,” Cullen said. “The way he had a second chance.”

‘To rewrite history’

As Riverkeeper’s board prepared for the showdown at its meeting in Manhattan in June 2000, the man who had given Kennedy his second chance wasn’t buying this argument. Boyle was adamant that Wegner not be hired, and he threatened to resign if Kennedy got his way.

Riverkeeper risked its credibility as a guardian of the environment, Boyle said, if it hired a man who had systematically exploited a continent’s wildlife for the better part of a decade. He was also exasperated over Kennedy’s stubborn desire to find Wegner a job.

“I found it absolutely bizarre, reckless and very damaging to the environmental movement,” Boyle told Talk magazine in 2000.

But Kennedy was bringing Riverkeeper’s board of directors around to his point of view. After a heated discussion, Kennedy’s side prevailed in a 13-to-8 vote. Boyle and those who agreed with him immediately quit.

Some of the castoffs went for drinks at the nearby New York Yacht Club, absorbing the realization that Boyle, after 34 years, was no longer a part of the organization he had created. But in the long run, the pain caused by the episode wasn’t easily salved. Boyle, Zagoreos said, “wasn’t the same after that.”

Neither, some say, was Riverkeeper. Ann Tonetti, a board member who resigned out of loyalty to Boyle, later rejoined, convinced the organization was still doing good work. But she eventually quit again.

“The enchantment of the people working for the river, and having Bobby [Kennedy] and Bob Boyle lead us, had kind of dwindled,” said Tonetti, now 83 and retired in West Palm Beach, Fla. “It had turned into kind of a society thing.”

Under Kennedy’s influence, the group continued to grow as a fundraising juggernaut; by the time he left in 2017 its annual revenue had surpassed $4 million, according to tax records. It has also expanded its reach, helping to seed nearly 300 affiliate organizations around the world under the Waterkeeper Alliance.

Wegner remained on staff at Riverkeeper for the next 22 years. Karen Klopp, a former board member who supported Kennedy, said Wegner was a model employee who never created the kind of problems Boyle predicted.

“All I know is he was a terrific addition to the already wonderful staff,” she said of Wegner. “I loved and respected Bob Boyle. He was a terrific guy. But those allegations did not come to pass.”

Two years after the Riverkeeper split, Boyle left the Hudson Valley, moving upstate to Cooperstown. He was there in 2005 when Kennedy published an article falsely asserting that vaccines caused autism — after multiple corrections, it was eventually retracted by Rolling Stone and Salon — and in the ensuing years as Kennedy doubled down on the article’s debunked premise.

To Boyle, his son said, Kennedy’s willingness to distort facts was familiar. But there was one set of falsehoods he would not let go unchallenged.

In March 2017, Kennedy resigned from Riverkeeper, citing the toll on his family by his cross-country commute from California and the demands of his work with World Mercury Project, the anti-vaccine group that would soon become Children’s Health Defense. Under Kennedy’s leadership, the annual revenue of Children’s Health Defense would balloon from a half-million dollars to more than $23 million, placing it in the vanguard of anti-vaccination advocacy groups.

In a resignation letter that was published on Riverkeeper’s website, Kennedy made claims that appear to be at odds with the historical record. The man who had discovered an already successful environmental group while doing court-imposed community service now falsely claimed to have founded Riverkeeper, which he said had “a budget of zero” before he arrived.

“It is extraordinarily difficult to leave the organization which I co-founded thirty-three years ago, built from the ground up and to which I’ve devoted most of my career,” Kennedy wrote.

In an interview with The Post, Kennedy said his resignation letter “was certainly accurate as to what I believed at that time.”

He added, “I have no memory of writing that letter, and I have no memory of anybody disputing anything that I said about my role at Riverkeeper.”

But somebody did.

By the time Kennedy resigned, he and Boyle had not spoken to each other for almost 17 years. But Boyle, then 88, called his former employee’s claim to have founded Riverkeeper “nonsensical” in an interview with the writer Jerry Oppenheimer for an article in the Daily Mail.

“He co-founded nothing. He founded nothing,” Boyle said. “When I read his letter, I wanted to throw up. He lives in a fantasy world.”

He said it was “very difficult to rewrite history when the man who made it is still alive.”

About two months later, Boyle died of cancer.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The milestone signaled that backers had clinched enough support to clear it out of the Senate, a step that would make it the most significant piece of internet regulation to do so in decades.

But now a group of lawmakers is pushing to couple the proposal with a separate bill banning kids under 13 from social media altogether , which could muddle the talks.

In April, Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Katie Britt (R-Ala.) unveiled the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, which would establish that age minimum and require that parents consent for teens 13 to 17 to access social media. The bill would also prohibit platforms from deploying algorithms to feed content to kids under 18.

The lawmakers behind it, all fathers or mothers, billed it as a way to keep kids safe online and empower their parents.

The measure resembled recent laws in GOP-led states like Utah and Arkansas restricting kids from accessing social media — but diverged from other state and federal efforts to force companies to build more safeguards for children and controls for parents, like KOSA.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a KOSA lead sponsor, criticized the Schatz bill at the time, saying it “appears to shift responsibility from tech companies to parents.” Digital rights and tech industry groups also spoke out against the bill, arguing it would infringe on younger users’ rights, bar them from partaking in positive online communities and force companies to collect far more data.

Schatz is now pushing for a key Senate panel to take up his bill to potentially pair it with KOSA, a prospect that’s prompting concern among some that it could bog down talks.

Schatz said Wednesday he’s “working toward a markup” with Senate Commerce Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who voiced support for taking up the bill last year , and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), the top Republican on the committee.

“We’re feeling optimistic that we can land this bill on a bipartisan basis,” Schatz said. Cantwell and Cruz each confirmed on Wednesday they are discussing the possibility.

Schatz argued coupling his and other child safety bills on the floor made the most sense.

“I imagine there’s only going to be one moment for all of the tech bills,” he said. “I imagine that all of these efforts are going to be merged in the floor process.”

But the proposal to ban kids under 13 from social media is facing significant roadblocks, with its lead Republicans pulling back their support, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke anonymously to discuss the private deliberations.

The bill is also undergoing major potential revisions. A recent updated draft, obtained by The Technology 202, stripped the measure’s provisions requiring that parents sign off for their teens to access social media and forcing companies to verify the ages of its users.

The bill would still prohibit those under 13 from having social media accounts and limit algorithmic recommendations for those under 17. Many social media platforms already prohibit users under 13 from joining, but the bill would make it a legal requirement.

The draft lists only Schatz as a sponsor. Spokespeople for Britt and Murphy declined to comment. Spokespeople for Cotton did not return a request for comment.

Schatz declined to comment on the bill’s original co-sponsors on Wednesday, but said that “none of those changes have been finalized.”

“No decisions have been made until we get to the markup, but for me the objective here is to get something enacted into law, not to be the mayor of this issue,” he said. “If we have to make compromises along the way … I’ll do whatever I need to do to pass this damn thing.”

The renewed consideration of Schatz’s proposal is sparking concern among proponents of KOSA that it could delay its timetable for getting to the floor or even endanger its prospects for passage, one of the people and another familiar with the dynamics said.

Blumenthal said Wednesday that there are “good and very viable concepts” in Schatz’s bill, but he cautioned that “time is not on our side” when it comes to getting a vote in the Senate.

“We should move forward with the proposals that have the broadest support, but at the same time, have open minds about what may add value,” he said. “This process is the art of addition not subtraction often … but we should make sure that we’re not undermining the base of support.”

Even as justices expressed concern about the power of social media giants that have become the dominant modern public forum, a majority of the court seemed to think the First Amendment prevents state governments from requiring platforms such as Facebook and YouTube to host certain content.

The high court’s decision in the two cases, likely to come near the end of the term in June, will have a significant impact on the operation of online platforms that are playing an increasingly important role in U.S. elections, democracy and public discussion.

The justices were reviewing a challenge from two tech industry associations, whose members include YouTube, Facebook and X, to Texas and Florida laws passed in 2021 in response to concerns from conservatives who said their voices are often censored by the editorial decisions of tech companies.

At issue for the court is whether the First Amendment protects the editorial discretion of large social media platforms or prohibits censorship of unpopular views. Social media posts have the potential to spread extremism and election disinformation, but taking down controversial views can silence discussion of important political issues.

A key question, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said during almost four hours of argument Monday, is whether the power to decide who can or cannot speak on a particular platform belongs to the government, or to social media companies.

“The First Amendment restricts what the government can do, and what the government is doing here is saying, you must do this, you must carry these people; you’ve got to explain if you don’t,” said Roberts, a conservative. “That’s not the First Amendment.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, also called the Florida and Texas laws problematic, saying they are “so broad that they stifle speech just on their face.”

But many justices also seemed unconvinced that the First Amendment protects all aspects or types of digital platforms. Some suggested that sections of the state laws prohibiting the removal of certain content or users could be constitutional as applied to e-commerce and communications sites such as Uber and Gmail.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked whether Gmail, for instance, has a First Amendment right to delete the email accounts of conservative commentator Tucker Carlson or liberal commentator Rachel Maddow if Google does not agree with one or the other’s viewpoints. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson raised similar concerns about Facebook’s messaging feature.

A majority of justices seemed to agree, however, that the First Amendment protects the right of Facebook and YouTube to rank and moderate posts on their platforms, just as newspapers can make editorial decisions and bookstores and theaters may choose which content to promote.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked whether Florida could enact a law ""telling bookstores that they have to put everything out by alphabetical order and that they can’t organize or put some things closer to the front of the store that they think, you know, their customers will want to buy?”

When platforms choose to remove misinformation about elections or take down content from anti-vaccination advocates or insurrectionists, Justice Elena Kagan suggested, they are exercising judgments “about the kind of speech they think they want on the site and the kinds of speech that they think is intolerable.”

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh also pushed back on the assertion by Florida’s solicitor general, Henry Whitaker, that the First Amendment is designed to prevent suppression of speech by private entities. “You left out what I understand to be three key words,” Kavanaugh said, emphasizing the amendment’s inclusion of the words “by the government.”

State government officials argued that regulations are needed to ensure the public has access to diverse sources of information. Unlike traditional media, the platforms make money not from speaking themselves, they said, but from attracting users to their platforms to speak, and therefore are more akin to utilities such as phone companies that must provide open access to all.

Tech companies “contend that they possess a broad First Amendment right to censor anything they host on their sites, even when doing so contradicts their own representations to consumers” that their platforms are neutral forums for free speech, Whitaker said.

Noting that millions of Americans rely on social media to work or socialize with family and friends, Texas Solicitor General Aaron Nielson said allowing those platforms to remove problematic content would mean ""there will be no public square to speak of.”

The hearing gave a rare glimpse into how the nine justices — who have joked that they are not the world’s foremost internet experts — use technology themselves. Justice Clarence Thomas appeared to suggest he was not a social media user, saying he was “not on any” when pressing the lawyer for the trade association NetChoice about how the companies’ algorithms functioned. Some justices appeared familiar with the workings of popular tech services, with Barrett describing Etsy as an online “flea market” and Alito asking repeated questions about Gmail.

Thomas and Alito, two of the court’s most conservative justices, sharply questioned the companies’ claims that they are engaging in editorial discretion when they take down objectionable posts or remove users. Alito pressed NetChoice to define the term “content moderation,” asking whether the term was “anything more than a euphemism for censorship.”

“If the government’s doing it, then content moderation might be a euphemism for censorship,” said attorney Paul Clement, representing NetChoice. “If a private party is doing it, content moderation is a euphemism for editorial discretion.”

Thomas and Alito also questioned how that stance squared with decades in which the companies argued against changes to a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act provision — Section 230 — that immunizes the platforms from lawsuits over posts that users share on their services. In making those arguments, Thomas said, the companies described their services as “merely a conduit” for those making the posts. On Monday, he continued, they described themselves as engaged in “expressive conduct,” effectively taking on the role of a publisher that would traditionally be liable for the content it hosts.

“Either it’s your message or it’s not your message. I don’t understand how it can be both,” Alito added. “It’s your message when you want to escape state regulation, but it’s not your message when you want to escape liability.”

But Clement disputed the characterization, focusing instead on the aspect of Section 230 that protects companies from lawsuits over their decisions to remove content from their websites. He argued that “the whole point” of the provision was to allow online platforms to “essentially exercise editorial discretion” in removing harmful content without fear that it would expose them to liability as a publisher of user speech they don’t moderate. If the Texas and Florida laws were to take effect, Clement said, platforms would be forced to carry the type of content that Congress was trying to prevent when it drafted Section 230 nearly 30 years ago.

Throughout the marathon arguments, the justices struggled to identify a specific path for resolving the challenges to the state laws. They seemed interested in suggestions from Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, who urged them to rule narrowly that the laws interfering with content placement decisions are unconstitutional, while leaving open for another day questions about other aspects of the laws.

Even if state officials have concerns about a social media company’s dominance, she said, the government cannot take over a private party’s judgment about how to present a product. But Prelogar acknowledged legitimate concerns about the kind of power and influence that social media platforms wield.

“It’s not like the government lacks tools to deal with this,"" she added, pointing to ""a whole body of government regulation that would be permissible that would target conduct, things like antitrust laws that could be applied or data privacy or consumer protection, things that we think wouldn’t come into any conflict with the First Amendment at all.”

The Supreme Court decided to take up the issue after two appeals courts issued conflicting rulings, both written by judges nominated by former president Donald Trump. In Florida, a unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that the restrictions of that state’s law probably violate the First Amendment. A divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, however, upheld the Texas law that bars companies from removing posts based on political ideology.

At its core, the First Amendment protects against government infringement on speech. Courts have also held that the First Amendment protects the right of private companies, including newspapers and broadcasters, to control the speech they publish and disseminate. It also includes the right of editors not to publish something they don’t want to publish.

In the 11th Circuit ruling, Judge Kevin Newsom said social media platforms are distinct from other communications services and utilities that carry data from point A to point B, and their “content-moderation decisions constitute the same sort of editorial judgments” entitled to First Amendment protections when made by a newspaper or other media outlet.

Judge Andrew Oldham of the 5th Circuit ruled the other way, saying social media companies had turned the First Amendment on its head by suggesting that a corporation has an “unenumerated right to muzzle speech” by banning users or removing certain posts. Oldham compared social media platforms to “common carriers” such as telephone companies.

Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said it was difficult to determine from the Supreme Court argument on Monday how the court would rule.

“It was very clear at today’s hearing that the platforms want a First Amendment that immunizes them from regulation altogether,” he said. ""And the states think the First Amendment shouldn’t be relevant here at all. The court should really reject both of these arguments. Whether it will, I guess we’ll see.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Bracelets like Scherwitz’s, adorned with the name of Taylor Swift’s sophomore album, have had a resurgence in the past year and have even made their way to the presidential campaign trail, where Scherwitz attracted the attention of Haley, who knelt to accept the bracelet.

“I love that it says fearless,” Haley said. “Because that’s what we have to be, right?” Haley promised to wear the bracelet, then posed for a photo with Scherwitz, her 11-year-old sister and 10-year-old friend, who all squealed.

Haley, a disciplined candidate who rarely departs from her stump speech, is often at her most animated while talking to the young girls who make up an unusually large segment of the crowds at her rallies. At dozens of campaign stops across multiple states, Haley beelined to talk to the girls, frequently offering them an extra touch of attention, such as adding a bonus message or hand-drawn heart to her autograph, or urging them to be “strong girls.”

The interactions may prove to be something of a legacy for the Haley campaign, which has netted few electoral accomplishments. She trails former president Donald Trump by nearly 30 points in polls ahead of Saturday’s primary in her home state of South Carolina but insists she will remain in the race.

Haley has walked a fine line on gender in her campaign, seeking to highlight her differences from her opponents as a woman of color but insisting that she does not believe in identity politics, or that there are “glass ceilings” limiting women. Her critics have accused her of diminishing barriers women face and selectively using her identity — and they’ve noted her opposition to abortion rights, an animating issue for many female voters.

She’s also deployed her rallying cry for “strong girls” politically — to oppose trans athletes playing on girls sports teams, a debate she has called the “women’s issue of our time.” One of her biggest applause lines on the campaign trail is: “Strong girls become strong women, strong women become strong leaders, and none of that happens if you have biological boys playing in girls sports.”

Still, her approach is an obvious contrast from Trump, who has a history of publicly denigrating women and was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil trial last year. And it’s a reminder of the ways that Republicans continue to struggle to appeal to women, as the party consolidates behind Trump rather than backing a candidate who could be the nation’s historic first female president and who has preformed better with suburban female voters, many of whom left the party because of Trump.

“When these girls see me, what it is they’re seeing is they just want to see what they can be,” Haley said in an interview this week aboard her campaign bus before a stop in Clemson, S.C., noting she never saw women or “any brown people” in leadership positions as a child. “They just want to see someone that looks like them.”

She compared men who “jump first and think after” to women who “think and think and think and think, and you have to almost push them to jump.” That difference, she said, is why she encourages women and the girls who attend her events “to push through the fear.”

“If I wouldn’t have pushed through the fear, I certainly wouldn’t be doing this,” she said.

Some of the girls’ excitement about Haley has helped win over voting-age relatives, like Jessica, a New Hampshire woman who attended a Haley meet-and-greet last month with her 5-year-old daughter, Cora, who brought a drawing of Haley that the candidate autographed. Cora, her mom said, became a fan of Haley after responding to seeing a woman running on TV and on the political mailers the family received.

“Cora’s been with her since day one,” said Jessica, who asked that only her first name be used to protect her daughter’s privacy. While she originally supported former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, she decided to support Haley after he suspended his campaign, in part due to Cora’s enthusiasm for her. Haley had her best showing in New Hampshire, securing 43 percent of the vote, but lost to Trump.

Penny Cannon, 71, brought her three granddaughters to a bus tour stop in Greenwood, S.C., this month. As the girls — 9, 6 and 4 — watched from coordinated small pink folding chairs with Minnie Mouse on them, Cannon said she is a Democrat but planning to vote for Haley.

“I want them to know that a woman can be president one day,” said Cannon, of Ninety Six, S.C. She said she was supporting Haley in part because she thinks she would be “a great role model for our girls.”

Some of the parents and grandparents at Haley’s events expressed a desire for their daughters and granddaughters to see Haley’s example of how to stand up to sexism, noting her aggressive rejoinders to her primary opponents’ gender-based attacks.

Haley said she is aware girls viewed her responses as instructive. “They want to know that they can fight back, that it doesn’t make you bad for fighting back,” she said.

Her young supporters have brought signs to her event proclaiming themselves “in our Nikki Haley era,” another reference to Swift, and — when she wore a hot pink blazer on the trail — compared her to Barbie. (Haley said her favorite Swift song is “Anti-Hero,” “the one that, like, where she talks about her daughter-in-law killing her for the money.”)

“In history class you hear about all these famous men and people, but they’re all men. There’s no women,” said Mary Claire Griffith, 12, who attended a Haley event in Greenwood, S.C., this month with her grandmother. “And I’m really excited to see what she’s going to do and what she can do for America.”

Added her 8-year-old sister, Carolina: “These boys over here, they think they got everything. They can just do whatever. And they try to [do] what they want to do, and they don’t care about what we think.”

After Haley signed an autograph for the sisters, Mary Claire said she told them “that we needed to be strong girls because America needs girls.”

On her bus, as Haley sorted through a pile of the friendship bracelets she has received from girls on the trail, she described the tokens as “their way of speaking without saying anything.”

“I just try and make them feel like they’re the most important person in the room,” said Haley, who has worn some of the bracelets on key dates, like the New Hampshire primary or for a speech Tuesday during which she promised to continue her campaign.

Haley’s interactions with young girls are reminiscent of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) pinkie promises with girls during her 2020 bid for the White House, asking them to pledge to remember that running for president is “what girls do.”

Reflecting last year on those exchanges, Warren distinguished them from the work of challenging gender disparities. “Everyone, men and women, progressive and conservative, can all say they support girls,” she said at the time. “That feels non-threatening to all the boys in the room.”

Asked about Warren’s perspective on the difference between campaigning on supporting girls versus broader gender inequalities, Haley downplayed such challenges for female candidates.

“Obviously women and male candidates have different experiences,” she said. “I don’t think one has it harder than the other. I just think that the experiences are different, and so I’ve never focused on the challenges of it.”

Haley said she wants her campaign to build girls’ confidence in speaking their minds and still being respected.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

In the early months of his presidency, as the pandemic dragged on with its stifling restrictions, President Biden often delivered a favorite monologue to aides: He was worried about young people’s mental health, he said. High school seniors were missing prom and graduation. He wanted to know how college students went on dates.

Specifically, Biden wondered how young people could “make love” under the circumstances, according to two aides who heard the president use that phrase multiple times during his first year in office. Biden’s fixation on loneliness among young people, the aides said, grew out of his near-daily conversations with his grandchildren.

Biden brought those concerns to Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy, who had written a book on loneliness, and encouraged him to prioritize the issue. Last May, Murthy released a National Strategy to Advance Social Connection, accompanied by guidance “calling attention to the public health crisis of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection in our country.”

Skip to end of carousel How Biden Leads arrow left arrow right This story is part of a three-part series scrutinizing Biden’s leadership style, and how he has run the most complex government in the world, as he asks voters to return him to the White House for a second term. Part 1: Absorbing information

Absorbing information Part 2: Making decisions (coming soon)

Making decisions Part 3: Speaking to America (coming soon) 1 / 2 End of carousel As president of the United States, Biden has access to practically unlimited information. He receives a daily classified briefing from the world’s most powerful intelligence apparatus. He can mobilize the vast machinery of the U.S. government to deliver data on various topics. He can convene meetings with world leaders, Cabinet officials or experts in any field — and often does. But to a remarkable degree, Biden relies on direct personal interaction for information: catch-up chats with his children and grandchildren; talks with fellow parishioners after Mass; exchanges with workers on his property in Wilmington, Del; spontaneous calls to former colleagues. From consumer prices to masking guidelines to loneliness, the president brings their worries to the Oval Office. The informal channels allow Biden to get authentic information and break out of the presidential bubble. But the chance encounters and informal chats also give the information a random, limited quality, seeming to depend on whom Biden runs into and their concerns of the moment, leaving some aides to marvel at the influence these casual interactions have on setting the governing agenda.

“There’s nobody that has been president of the United States in the last 50 years that spends as much time doing that and enjoying doing that and gaining information by doing that,” said former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), a close friend and longtime staffer. “If you know what Joe Biden is about, that’s what Joe Biden is. You couldn’t change him.”

Now in his fourth year in office, Biden has compiled an extensive record as chief executive of the most powerful organization in the world. Voters’ judgment on how he has filled that role will be critical as they decide whether they grant him a second term. The Washington Post is examining three pillars of Biden’s leadership — how he absorbs information, how he makes decisions and how he talks to Americans — based on interviews with more than 100 current and former White House staffers, political allies and adversaries, and close friends of the president.

“There’s nobody that has been president of the United States in the last 50 years that spends as much time doing that and enjoying doing that and gaining information by doing that.

The result is a rare portrait of a very private president based on details and incidents that have not been previously reported. The White House declined to make Biden available for an interview.

The Monday barrage

Biden’s aides concede privately that Americans’ perception of him as a declining octogenarian is now his biggest political hurdle. That comes partly from his physical appearance: At 81, he walks stiffly, speaks haltingly, squints awkwardly. The concerns were underlined by special counsel Robert Hur’s recent report that his decision not to prosecute Biden for mishandling classified documents was partly due to the president coming off as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”

Aides and allies of the president insist that description bears no resemblance to the man they know, saying their jobs would be much easier if it did. In private, they say, Biden swears. He raises his voice. He demands more information. He dresses down aides, on occasion threatening to fire them, though he never does.

Staffers have learned to brace for a particularly fierce barrage from the president on Mondays after he returns from his regular weekend trips to Delaware, as he demands answers to questions from residents of Wilmington or Rehoboth Beach with whom he has chatted.

One week, Biden told aides that a gardener on his property in Wilmington was complaining about rising prices. Biden knew inflation was a problem, but now he directed his team to find better ways to tell Americans how he was fighting it.

On another Monday, Biden walked into the Oval Office with detailed questions about the renewable-fuel standard, a little-known rule designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In Wilmington over the weekend, he had heard from a resident worried that the rule could lead to job losses at a nearby refinery.

After attending Mass one weekend in Delaware, the president told his aides that congregants were confused about the government’s covid-19 masking policy. He told his team to clarify the guidelines on when people were still required to wear face coverings.

All presidents look for ways to gather information from outside the golden cocoon of the White House. Barack Obama read 10 letters a night from ordinary Americans, studying them in the solitude of the White House residence. Donald Trump made late-night calls to his well-connected, often wealthy friends, soliciting advice and sharing grievances.

Decades ago, the presidency was far less insular. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on his trips to Warm Springs, Ga., would pull into farmers’ driveways to ask about their crops, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said.

Biden is in many ways extending the habits of his 36 years as a senator, when he rode Amtrak to and from Wilmington each workday, chatting with conductors, listening to passengers and getting real-time feedback. While his bubble has shrunk dramatically, informal communication still influences his priorities; the encounters may be fewer, but that means each one carries greater weight.

Biden loves to make unannounced calls to current and former lawmakers, to seek advice or just check in. But the outreach is largely one-way; longtime friends have been surprised at how difficult it is to get to the president these days. One old friend said that one of the rare times he heard from Biden was by accident, when the president inadvertently dialed him while playing with his dog in his yard in Wilmington.

Biden does speak regularly to Obama and former president Bill Clinton. Aides say Biden is more regularly in contact with Clinton — whose outgoing style he shares — even though he spent eight years as Obama’s vice president.

For all his gregariousness, though, Biden has always kept an unusually tight circle of advisers, several of whom are now in the White House with him. Many top aides have worked for Biden for decades and become personally close with the president and his family. Kaufman, now his best friend, was initially Biden’s chief of staff in the Senate. Another close confidant, Mark Gitenstein, worked for Biden in the 1980s on the Senate Judiciary Committee and is now ambassador to the European Union.

Biden has remarked on how restricted his life has become, saying at a town hall in 2021 that the White House is a “little like a gilded cage in terms of being able to walk outside and do things.” That has led him to leave the confines of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue nearly every weekend, mostly to spend time at his homes in Delaware or visit the presidential retreat at Camp David.

A classic retail politician, Biden has long relished a rope line or a parade. As a presidential candidate, he was notoriously late to campaign appearances because he had stuck around at an earlier event to talk with voters for much longer than his aides planned — or wanted. The pandemic put an abrupt end to that near the end of the 2020 primaries, and now that he has resumed chatting with ordinary people, he is surrounded by a phalanx of Secret Service agents who limit his interactions.

Biden’s bookshelf

Unlike other presidents, Biden is not an avid reader of books, consumer of pop culture or follower of professional sports. Aides and friends say he is likely to hear about sports scores from his wife, an enthusiastic fan of Philadelphia’s teams, rather than by watching a game himself. That makes personal conversation one of his only unofficial sources of information.

“Biden is not a recreational reader,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff. “He’s a voracious reader of briefings.”

In the evenings, if Biden is not talking to his children or grandchildren, he is usually diving into a report prepared by his aides.

On a typical day, Biden leaves the Oval Office at dinnertime to eat with his wife. He then spends about two hours poring over his daily briefing book, which often runs more than 100 pages and can include as many as 300, Klain said.

His news consumption comes from three main sources: cable television, print newspapers and the Apple News app on his iPhone. Biden is a loyal watcher of “Morning Joe” on MSNBC, tuning in most mornings while he works out. If the show runs a negative segment on Biden, he often complains to aides in the morning when he arrives at the Oval Office.

Biden also watches CNN and Fox News, aides say. Although he is not nearly as glued to the television screen as Trump was, some aides wish the president would spend less time watching cable news.

A stack of print newspapers awaits Biden outside the Oval Office each day, and he often thumbs through them in the outer lobby or reads them aboard Air Force One — or the Marine One helicopter, where it’s too loud to talk. One aide said his favorite newspaper is the Financial Times, a British-based business daily.

Biden regularly calls a top aide when a story catches his attention. Late last year, Biden phoned Jeff Zients, his chief of staff, after reading about a letter that Democratic lawmakers had written to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona urging the administration to expand its student debt relief plan.

“Biden is not a recreational reader. He’s a voracious reader of briefings.” Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff “Biden is not a recreational reader. He’s a voracious reader of briefings.” Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff “Biden is not a recreational reader. He’s a voracious reader of briefings.” Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff “Biden is not a recreational reader. He’s a voracious reader of briefings.” Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff

Biden pressed Zients, wanting to make sure his team was making the relief as expansive as possible. White House officials say they are still formulating the policy, adding that their goal is indeed to make relief accessible to large numbers of people.

Just before the 2022 midterm elections, Biden read a news story about a spike in online chatter about “civil war.” The president had just spoken in Philadelphia to warn that Trump and his supporters threatened “the very foundations of our republic,” and after reading the story, he decided he wanted to give another sweeping speech.

He called Mike Donilon, one of his closest aides, saying he wanted to address the embrace of violence in the country. So six days before Election Day, Biden went to Washington’s Union Station and spoke about democracy again, this time with a focus on the rise of political violence.

Biden seems rarely to read for pleasure. Clinton was known to walk around the West Wing holding a book, often a work of fiction. He came up with the idea for a national stockpile of critical medical supplies after reading “The Cobra Event,” by Richard Preston, about a fictional bioterrorism attack. Obama as president posted lists of his favorite books, including a summer reading list timed to his annual vacation to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Trump, while not a big reader, commented regularly on events in pop culture. Biden, in contrast, rarely discusses what he is reading or pop culture.

When he does read for leisure, he appears to focus almost exclusively on policy and history. According to Biden’s aides, some of the books he’s read recently include “Ten Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World,” by Fareed Zakaria, and “Why England Slept,” the published version of President John F. Kennedy’s senior thesis from Harvard.

Before the 2022 midterms, Biden was spotted carrying a copy of “And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle,” by Jon Meacham, who advises the president on speechwriting. And while shopping in Nantucket, Mass., where he was celebrating Thanksgiving last year with his family, Biden emerged from a bookstore holding “Democracy Awakening: Notes on the State of America,” by Heather Cox Richardson, a historian who met with Biden at the White House in 2022.

Sharing wacky stories

Much of his leisure time, though, is spent with family, either in person or on the phone. Aides say the president rarely goes a day without talking to his two surviving children, Hunter and Ashley, as well as his five grandchildren, who are in their teens or older.

This younger generation has become an important source of information for the 81-year-old president. As vice president, Biden made headlines — and angered Obama aides — by telling a television interviewer that he supported legalizing same-sex marriage at a time when Obama had not yet announced his own support. Aides to Biden say his grandchildren were especially influential in his embrace of that policy, and since then, the grandkids have affected his views on issues such as climate change, which the president has put at the center of his agenda.

Like many presidents, Biden also relies on mail as a way to hear directly from ordinary people. The White House Office of Presidential Correspondence, which dates to President William McKinley more than 120 years ago, oversees the thousands of letters — now mostly emails — the president receives every day.

Each president interacts with that outpouring from the American public in their own way. Clinton received a batch of letters every few weeks, while President George W. Bush received them less frequently. Obama was characteristically systematic, asking his staff to insert 10 letters into his briefing materials each night.

Biden is given five letters a week, often setting them aside for weekend reading. While Obama sought a representative sample of letters, Biden aides have asked staffers in the correspondence office to select letters that skew toward the positive. In particular, officials are asked to select letters from Americans who focus on how Biden’s policies have improved their lives.

But if the letters are carefully chosen, other streams of information are more random. In his regular use of Apple News, the president sometimes comes across wacky trending stories, including articles on unusual animal behavior, which he then eagerly shares with staffers sitting nearby.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

In the early months of his presidency, as the pandemic dragged on with its stifling restrictions, President Biden often delivered a favorite monologue to aides: He was worried about young people’s mental health, he said. High school seniors were missing prom and graduation. He wanted to know how college students went on dates.

Specifically, Biden wondered how young people could “make love” under the circumstances, according to two aides who heard the president use that phrase multiple times during his first year in office. Biden’s fixation on loneliness among young people, the aides said, grew out of his near-daily conversations with his grandchildren.

Biden brought those concerns to Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy, who had written a book on loneliness, and encouraged him to prioritize the issue. Last May, Murthy released a National Strategy to Advance Social Connection, accompanied by guidance “calling attention to the public health crisis of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection in our country.”

Skip to end of carousel How Biden Leads arrow left arrow right This story is part of a three-part series scrutinizing Biden’s leadership style, and how he has run the most complex government in the world, as he asks voters to return him to the White House for a second term. Part 1: Absorbing information

Absorbing information Part 2: Making decisions (coming soon)

Making decisions Part 3: Speaking to America (coming soon) 1 / 2 End of carousel As president of the United States, Biden has access to practically unlimited information. He receives a daily classified briefing from the world’s most powerful intelligence apparatus. He can mobilize the vast machinery of the U.S. government to deliver data on various topics. He can convene meetings with world leaders, Cabinet officials or experts in any field — and often does. But to a remarkable degree, Biden relies on direct personal interaction for information: catch-up chats with his children and grandchildren; talks with fellow parishioners after Mass; exchanges with workers on his property in Wilmington, Del; spontaneous calls to former colleagues. From consumer prices to masking guidelines to loneliness, the president brings their worries to the Oval Office. The informal channels allow Biden to get authentic information and break out of the presidential bubble. But the chance encounters and informal chats also give the information a random, limited quality, seeming to depend on whom Biden runs into and their concerns of the moment, leaving some aides to marvel at the influence these casual interactions have on setting the governing agenda.

“There’s nobody that has been president of the United States in the last 50 years that spends as much time doing that and enjoying doing that and gaining information by doing that,” said former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), a close friend and longtime staffer. “If you know what Joe Biden is about, that’s what Joe Biden is. You couldn’t change him.”

Now in his fourth year in office, Biden has compiled an extensive record as chief executive of the most powerful organization in the world. Voters’ judgment on how he has filled that role will be critical as they decide whether they grant him a second term. The Washington Post is examining three pillars of Biden’s leadership — how he absorbs information, how he makes decisions and how he talks to Americans — based on interviews with more than 100 current and former White House staffers, political allies and adversaries, and close friends of the president.

“There’s nobody that has been president of the United States in the last 50 years that spends as much time doing that and enjoying doing that and gaining information by doing that. If you know what Joe Biden is about, that’s what Joe Biden is. You couldn’t change him.” Former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), a close friend and longtime staffer “There’s nobody that has been president of the United States in the last 50 years that spends as much time doing that and enjoying doing that and gaining information by doing that.

If you know what Joe Biden is about, that’s what Joe Biden is. You couldn’t change him.” Former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), a close friend and longtime staffer

The result is a rare portrait of a very private president based on details and incidents that have not been previously reported. The White House declined to make Biden available for an interview.

The Monday barrage

Biden’s aides concede privately that Americans’ perception of him as a declining octogenarian is now his biggest political hurdle. That comes partly from his physical appearance: At 81, he walks stiffly, speaks haltingly, squints awkwardly. The concerns were underlined by special counsel Robert Hur’s recent report that his decision not to prosecute Biden for mishandling classified documents was partly due to the president coming off as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”

Aides and allies of the president insist that description bears no resemblance to the man they know, saying their jobs would be much easier if it did. In private, they say, Biden swears. He raises his voice. He demands more information. He dresses down aides, on occasion threatening to fire them, though he never does.

Staffers have learned to brace for a particularly fierce barrage from the president on Mondays after he returns from his regular weekend trips to Delaware, as he demands answers to questions from residents of Wilmington or Rehoboth Beach with whom he has chatted.

One week, Biden told aides that a gardener on his property in Wilmington was complaining about rising prices. Biden knew inflation was a problem, but now he directed his team to find better ways to tell Americans how he was fighting it.

On another Monday, Biden walked into the Oval Office with detailed questions about the renewable-fuel standard, a little-known rule designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In Wilmington over the weekend, he had heard from a resident worried that the rule could lead to job losses at a nearby refinery.

After attending Mass one weekend in Delaware, the president told his aides that congregants were confused about the government’s covid-19 masking policy. He told his team to clarify the guidelines on when people were still required to wear face coverings.

The front-runners for the post, Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.), have more than 20 years each in congressional tenure, hailing from the traditional Reagan-Bush orthodoxy that most Republican senators still find comfortable. A third aspirant, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), has lurched rightward in recent years as Donald Trump’s nativist populism took root.

And as the surprise McConnell news broke open, with his stepping out of leadership at year’s end, the more junior Republicans began floating other contenders who are more reflexively accommodating to Trump’s wishes.

“There’s no doubt it’s time to turn the page. I mean, we’ve got to turn the page here as a party. We’ve got to get back to supporting working people over corporate interests. We’ve got to get rid of the corporate money that has gushed into our politics,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a frequent McConnell critic, told reporters.

In many ways, the Senate Republican Conference has served as the last bulwark of traditional conservatism as it’s been represented by McConnell, who won his first Senate race on the coattails of Ronald Reagan’s 1984 landslide reelection.

Even in recent years, a clear majority of Senate Republicans preferred lower taxes for the wealthy and far less government regulations, combined with a strong national defense that would reassure allies and intimidate our rivals.

But that orthodoxy has received its stiffest challenge over the last year, as Hawley and about a dozen other Republicans have vocally opposed McConnell and tried to exert pressure on his potential successors.

In a quick aside during his bombshell speech Wednesday, McConnell noted the GOP’s dramatic shift on global security after his bruising battle with his Trumpian wing to pass legislation that would provide more than $60 billion to Ukraine’s defenses.

“Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time. I have many faults — misunderstanding politics is not one of them,” he said.

Having turned 82 last week, McConnell has seen the entire party shift over the last 17 years, the longest service for any Republican or Democratic leader.

His allies were quick to defend McConnell as not getting pushed out by Trump, with whom he has had a political cold war since late 2020, or his enemies within the GOP conference. “No, I do not think he was forced out in any way. This was his decision,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said.

Since McConnell took a nasty fall last March that kept him out of the Senate for six weeks, many Republicans had been wondering how long he would stay on the job. Allies to potential successors engaged in whisper campaigns to try to explain who should get the job.

Now that campaign can be held out in the open, even as the aspirants paused on Wednesday. “Just hold that thought,” Thune said after reporters asked his intentions.

“That election is nine months away, and there’s a much more important election between now and then,” Barrasso said, suggesting the November general election should preoccupy senators’ minds.

Only Cornyn gave a slight admission of his plans. “I think today is about Mitch McConnell, but I’ve made no secret of my intention,” he said.

Some suggested that, behind the scenes, the potential successors have fully launched their bids. “I’ve had a lot of calls today,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters late Wednesday.

Every Senate leadership election is the most personal of transactions — sometimes a vote comes down to some political act done a decade or two ago, sometimes it comes from a key legislative favor offered years ago — but this race is shaping up to test those traditions more than ever.

And the decisive cluster of Republican votes is likely to come from those loudest anti-McConnell voices.

Thune starts out with a slight edge over Cornyn, in part because Thune’s current role as No. 2 in leadership, the whip, makes him a natural successor, according to multiple senior GOP aides.

A third of today’s 49 Senate Republicans took office after Cornyn, who served six years as whip and four years as head of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, left the ranks of elected leadership at the end of 2018.

But most Republicans believe Thune is short of a clear majority of the 49 currently serving in the GOP, with Cornyn maybe up to a handful or so votes behind.

That would leave about a dozen to 15 Republicans up in the air, almost all of whom come from the wing that voted against extending McConnell’s leadership run after the 2022 elections. If this group worked together, they could back Barrasso on a first ballot and possibly leave both Thune and Cornyn short of the majority, while trying to extract concessions from either of the top two to tip the balance on a second ballot.

“There are lots of conversations that are ongoing between all sorts of different collections of senators,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) told reporters.

For Democrats, McConnell’s departure marks a strange twist. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who won election in 2010, spent his first couple years marveling at how strong McConnell’s leadership team remained despite renegades such as Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in his ranks.

Paul had defeated a top McConnell acolyte in 2010, and Cruz knocked off a close Cornyn ally when he chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

“He managed to hold his caucus together. He managed to deliver on some of their core goals, in particular, capturing the Supreme Court and moving it far to the right,” Coons said, noting three conservative justices appointed under McConnell’s watch.

But Coons noted how much the GOP changed with each election, pointing to Tennessee’s swaps of two establishment Republicans, who were very close to McConnell, for two firebrands.

“There’s been a steady movement toward younger members of the Republican caucus who do not value and support compromise and bipartisanship and respect for leadership,” he said.

Rather than the bitter enemy they spoke of with anger and fury last decade, Democrats have recently appreciated McConnell’s help averting calamities such as government funding shutdowns or defaults on the national debt.

Just Tuesday, after a White House meeting with President Biden and congressional leaders, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) repeatedly praised McConnell for his strong words in support of Ukraine.

It’s the sort of thing that far-right Republicans despise. One antagonist, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), used his increasingly conspiratorial-driven social media accounts to talk about “The Firm” when criticizing McConnell and Schumer.

The ultimate wild card would be if Trump wins the presidency and wants to try to force GOP senators to elect someone he is most comfortable with.

That would benefit Barrasso, or some other wild-card contender, because Trump used to frequently criticize Thune for his lack of forceful support. Cornyn’s political sins, to the most conservative senators, came by working with Democrats on modest gun-violence legislation in 2022 and a bill to expand U.S. manufacturing of electronic chips.

While senators have traditionally guarded these leadership posts against such outside interference, one notable exception came after the 2002 midterm elections. George W. Bush’s presidential advisers helped push Trent Lott (R-Miss.) out of his expected ascension to majority leader after he made comments in support of Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), an avowed segregationist, at his 100th birthday party.

Instead, Republicans elected Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), just eight years as a senator to that point, as majority leader. Frist’s four-year tenure as leader came with lots of discussion about his own ambition to run for president in 2008, a rocky path in which the relative newcomer struggled. He eventually retired from politics altogether.

Veteran Republicans believe those aspirants to McConnell’s job, above all else, need to swear off any ambition beyond the Senate.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

John Thune (S.D.)

Senate Minority Whip John Thune (S.D.) is the No. 2 Republican in the Senate and one of McConnell’s closest allies. Thune has been in the Senate since 2005, rising through the party’s leadership ranks. Before that, he served in the House for six years. As minority whip, Thune serves as McConnell’s deputy, and it is his job to manage the logistics and math behind the whipping of votes across the conference.

Thune, 63, first joined the Senate GOP leadership in 2006 after then-Senate Republican Whip Trent Lott (Miss.) picked him as chief deputy whip. Thune went on to serve as vice-chair of the Senate Republican Conference before becoming the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, the No. 4 GOP position in the Senate.

He became the chairman of the Republican Conference in 2012, making him the third-most powerful Republican in the Senate — and the highest-ranking Republican senator in his home state’s history. By 2019, he was the Senate majority whip, a position he held until 2021, when Democrats took the Senate.

Thune also served as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee for four years until 2019.

After McConnell announced he was stepping away from leadership, reporters flocked to Thune’s office, which sits steps from the Senate floor. There, he said McConnell “leaves really big shoes to fill” but declined to say whether he would run to replace him.

On Thursday, a spokesman for Thune said the senator is “reaching out to each of his colleagues directly to discuss the future of the Senate Republican Conference and what they would like to see in their next leader.”

“He looks forward to having substantive conversations over the next few days and weeks about the future, but he intends on keeping those conversations private,” the spokesman said.

Thune endorsed former president Donald Trump’s White House bid on Sunday, despite a rift between the two. Trump became highly critical of Thune — and even called for him to be primaried — after Thune and McConnell refused to help Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Today, we’re left to put together the pieces of a couple of much-spun results in the Michigan presidential primary.

To recap: On the Republican side, Donald Trump continued his march to the nomination, but Nikki Haley still pulled roughly 27 percent as an effective protest vote. On the Democratic side, President Biden won even bigger, but about 13 percent of voters opted for “uncommitted,” in a more direct protest vote over his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza.

Advertisement

Neither is a game-changing result. But with a pair of front-runners whom the electorate is remarkably meh on — and with the general election having effectively begun — it matters which candidate has bigger problems with his base.

Let’s start with Biden and what the Gaza issue portends.

The big moment

To hear some tell it, Biden ceding more than 1 in 8 voters to “uncommitted” betrays a serious liability with his base in November — and the need to side more with the Palestinians’ cause. To hear others tell it, it’s pretty much a nothingburger.

The truth is somewhere in the middle. The defections were significant but far from a shock wave. This is clearly something Biden will have to mind — but mostly because Michigan is such a competitive state where even a minor shift could matter. And the war in Gaza, which both arouses huge passions and splits his party roughly in half, could play more of a role here than elsewhere.

Advertisement

The percentage of “uncommitted” votes on Tuesday was only slightly higher than it was in the last Michigan primary featuring an incumbent Democratic president, Barack Obama in 2012. Obama ceded 10.7 percent. He actually ceded even more votes to “uncommitted” or “no preference” that year in several other states.

The comparisons aren’t perfect, for reasons I broke down in my takeaways last night. This was obviously much more of a protest vote concerning a specific issue — and an issue that animates Biden’s left flank.

The question is whether people who lodge a protest vote in February might not still be punishing him over it — especially with Donald Trump likely the alternative — in November. We also don’t know what Biden’s stance might be on the war by the fall, and what the situation on the ground in Gaza will look like.

Advertisement

It’s very difficult to say how this affects November with any certainty; we don’t even have exit polls to tell us how many Democrats are threatening not to support Biden. (At least 1 in 5 voters have said that about Trump in Republican contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.)

But it’s hardly the only evidence that this could be a tough issue for Biden to massage in the months ahead. To wit:

The problem for Biden is that virtually any decision or statement he makes risks alienating at least one wing of his party.

If there’s some good news for Biden, it’s that this doesn’t yet appear to be a huge issue for lots of voters. The YouGov poll shows just 13 percent of Democrats “strongly” disapproved of his handling of the war. And even in that Fox News Michigan poll, just 24 percent labeled it an “extremely” important issue to them — less than among Republicans.

Advertisement

We don’t know how many of those people are dug in against Biden or view this as a tipping-point issue. Yes, Trump sides even more with Israel, so he’s not an obvious home for these voters. But there are third-party candidates more aligned with the Palestinians’ cause, and sometimes people lodge protest votes or stay home.

A small number of angry Democrats could matter greatly in a close race — in Michigan or elsewhere. But next to other Biden’s liabilities (his age/immigration) and Trump’s liabilities (his extremeness/his legal problems), it’s not clear this currently ranks terribly high.

What is clear is that it’s worth watching.

Trump’s suburban struggle moment

There were also plenty of protest votes on the Republican side, of course.

It’s not strictly comparable, given these votes were for an actual person (and established politician) by the name of Nikki Haley — whom voters might simply like better than Trump. But Trump is continuing to cede lots of votes.

Advertisement

And nowhere does Trump face bigger defections and questions than in the suburbs.

In Michigan, two of Trump’s worst counties were Washtenaw (44 percent Haley) and Oakland (33 percent Haley), just outside of Detroit. He also lost 34 percent in Grand Rapids-based Kent County and 36 percent in Kalamazoo County.

And even in his 20-point win in South Carolina on Saturday, Trump actually lost three counties by double digits — two in the Charleston area and Columbia-based Richland County.

It’s no secret that the Trump era has cost the GOP in the suburbs — owing in large part to his problems with educated voters. But it’s still been close in each of his two campaigns. Trump won the suburbs by four points in 2016, then lost them narrowly in 2020.

Recent polls suggest that might not hold up. A Marist College poll this month showed suburban voters disliked Trump 64-32 and favored Biden by 25 points. And a December New York Times/Siena College poll showed suburban voters disliked Trump 62-34 and favored Biden by 14 points.

Given the suburbs are roughly half the vote these days, this could matter greatly.

A moment when Super Tuesday went very wrong

Super Tuesday is nigh — more than a dozen states will vote March 5, and a third of GOP delegates are at stake — and that gives us a chance to share one of our favorite presidential primary stories.

The challenge of campaigning in multiple states is real, but in no case has it been more real than it was in 1984 for Gary Hart.

Aiming to recast the impending Democratic National Convention by sweeping the final of three “Super Tuesdays,” Hart’s campaign decided to dispatch his wife to California while he campaigned in New Jersey. At a later event, Hart reflected, “The good news for her is she campaigns in California and I campaign in New Jersey.”

“I got to hold a koala bear,” his wife said.

Advertisement

Hart responded: “I won’t tell you what I got to hold: samples from a toxic waste dump.”

Offense was taken at the seemingly tired New Jersey dig and stereotype. And while Hart had led in some New Jersey polls, Walter Mondale went on to win it by 15 points. His domination of the delegates there helped put an end to a very drawn-out race.

And if not for later events, this episode might be a bigger part of Hart’s political obituary.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The New York Senate voted down the map proposal Monday afternoon, followed by the lower chamber.

The rejection of the map is likely to spark a legal challenge ahead of the state’s June 25 primary.

The proposed map was approved earlier this month by the New York State Independent Redistricting Commission. It would have made it easier for Democrats to flip at least one seat this year — that of Rep. Brandon Williams — but otherwise did not make any major changes to district lines used in 2022.

After the commission adopted the map, the district lines drew criticism from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who is poised to become speaker if Democrats regain the majority. A spokesman for Jeffries said on Feb. 16 that state lawmakers needed to “meticulously” scrutinize the proposal, particularly whether it protected “historically under-represented communities.”

Democratic leaders in Albany had the option to pass the commission-approved map or try to advance another that is more favorable to their party.

After Republicans picked up four House seats in New York in 2022, the state is shaping up to again be pivotal in determining which party wins control of the House in November’s elections. Democrats need a net gain of four seats nationwide to retake the majority.

In a special election that many saw as a barometer for 2024, Democrats picked up a House seat for the rest of the congressional term earlier this month in New York when former congressman Tom Suozzi won the race to replace Republican George Santos, who was expelled from Congress late last year.

The New York congressional map has been under scrutiny since 2022, when Democrats drew one that was heavily favorable to themselves and the state’s highest court struck it down as unconstitutional.

After the votes Monday, the Republican leader of the New York Senate, Rob Ortt, said in a statement that Democrats were “once again poised to create their own gerrymandered maps in another shameful power grab.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Oregon’s drug decriminalization law may be on the line

Oregon lawmakers are on the brink of reversing the state’s pioneering drug decriminalization measure, driven by intense backlash amid surges in fentanyl use and overdoses.

The Oregon House of Representatives voted yesterday, 51-7, to reclassify possession of a minor amount of drugs as a misdemeanor. The bill now heads to the Oregon Senate, with Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek signaling potential support .

The state’s troubled implementation of Measure 110 has sparked heated debates over drug policy, public safety and justice — fracturing communities, activists and political figures in a solidly Democratic state. The tension surrounding the measure reflects a broader national debate on the role of law enforcement and courts in addressing the country’s drug crisis.

Championed by the Drug Policy Alliance, Measure 110 was lauded as an innovative public health approach and a rejection of the failed war on drugs that disproportionately harmed people of color. Inspired by Portugal’s model of decriminalization , nearly 60 percent of Oregon voters endorsed it in November 2020.

The measure eliminated criminal penalties for minor drug possession, replacing them with $100 citations that could be waived upon calling a state-funded hotline and enrolling in a treatment assessment. The law, enacted in February 2021, allocated significant marijuana tax revenue to bolster addiction services.

Identifying challenges

The proliferation of illicit fentanyl, which arrived later on the West Coast than in other regions, was among the confluence of factors that hampered Measure 110 from the start.

Oregon’s historical underinvestment in behavioral health services exacerbated the issue, creating a shortage of providers for drug users meant to benefit from the new law, said addiction doctor Andrew Mendenhall, CEO of Central City Concern, a Portland social services nonprofit.

State auditors also flagged concerns about the Oregon Health Authority's management of grants intended to enhance addiction services. While these grants are now flowing, it will take years to develop the treatment workforce and infrastructure, noted Mendenhall.

The pandemic further strained health-care services, exacerbating mental health issues and homelessness, contributing to a perception of rampant open-air drug use in cities like Portland, observed Marisa Zapata of Portland State University’s Homelessness Research and Action Collaborative.

Despite thousands of citations issued by police, the treatment hotline intended for those cited for drug possession received fewer than 300 calls since the law's inception, according to the health authority.

“Even as it destroys your life, fentanyl use feels so good in the short term that many people won’t try to give it up without the external pressure that Measure 110 eliminated,” said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University psychiatry professor and former White House drug-policy adviser.

Looking ahead

Public perception linking Measure 110 to spikes in petty crime and open-air drug use has fueled calls for its repeal in several Oregon counties.

Under the legislation passed by the House yesterday, drug possession will revert to a misdemeanor offense, accompanied by penalties of up to 180 days in jail or 18 months of probation. Additionally, the bill encourages diversion to state-funded “deflection” programs aimed at steering individuals toward treatment rather than incarceration. The state is also allocating grants for medication-assisted opioid addiction treatment within jails, among other provisions aimed at addressing addiction.

Officials estimate that the law will result in approximately 2,257 misdemeanor drug possession convictions annually in Oregon, with Black and Hispanic defendants disproportionately represented.

👀 Government shutdown watch

Congress passed legislation yesterday to keep the government’s lights on this weekend, teeing up another mad scramble over policy and spending negotiations with another shutdown deadline only about a week away, our colleague Jacob Bogage reports.

The stopgap spending bill cleared the Senate by a 77-13 vote last night after winning House approval by a 320-99 margin in the afternoon. The measure now heads to Biden’s desk for his signature.

A closer look: Without the short-term extender, financing for about 20 percent of the government was set to expire Saturday just after midnight.

The legislation pushes the funding deadline for those agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, to March 8. Funding for the rest of the federal government under the bill expires March 22, two weeks later than under current law.

Alabama lawmakers pass legislation to protect IVF treatment

Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature voted yesterday to protect IVF providers from criminal or civil liability if embryos they help to create are subsequently damaged or destroyed, The Post’s Molly Hennessy-Fiske reports.

The fast action by both the Alabama House and Senate on bills to shield IVF came less than two weeks after the state’s supreme court ruled that frozen embryos are people and that individuals could be liable for destroying them. Within days, nearly every clinic in the state either suspended IVF or halted embryo disposal .

Meanwhile, in Missouri …

Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey sued a Planned Parenthood affiliate yesterday, accusing the organization of helping minors travel out of state to obtain abortions without parental consent in violation of Missouri law.

In the lawsuit , Bailey cites undercover footage released by the conservative group Project Veritas last year that purports to show a Planned Parenthood Great Plains employee offering to arrange an abortion for a 13-year-old in Kansas without notifying her parents.

Bailey is seeking a court injunction prohibiting the organization, which operates clinics in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma, from helping minors terminate their pregnancies.

The view from Planned Parenthood: A spokesperson for the organization said the Project Veritas video was taken without staff’s knowledge and was “heavily doctored and edited.” They said Planned Parenthood Great Plains does not provide any transportation directly to patients, regardless of age or where they live, Anna Spoerre reports for the Missouri Independent.

Disruptions from Change Healthcare cyberattack aren’t going away anytime soon

Outages stemming from the cyberattack on UnitedHealth Group’s technology unit may persist for weeks , leaving hospitals and pharmacies to grapple with cumbersome workarounds, Stat’s Brittany Trang reports.

Key context: The insurance giant became aware of the attack against Change Healthcare last Wednesday, prompting a shutdown of its systems to safeguard patient data. More than a week later, the hack continues to disrupt billing and care-authorization portals nationwide, leading to delays in patients’ prescriptions and providers’ paychecks.

To alleviate frustrations, UnitedHealth is launching a loan program to assist providers unable to submit insurance claims while Change remains offline, the company’s chief operating officer, Dirk McMahon, said in a Tuesday conference call with hospital cybersecurity officers. The initiative will last “for the next couple of weeks as this continues to go on,” he said.

Administered through UnitedHealth’s Optum Pay, the program will disburse weekly amounts to providers based on their claim history in the last year. The company would expect providers to pay it back after Change resumes normal operations.

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Biden will visit Brownsville, making his second trip to the border since becoming president. His trip is part of a recent effort to take the initiative on the issue of illegal immigration, which polls suggest has been politically damaging for him.

Trump, the leading Republican presidential contender, will visit Eagle Pass, a city that has become a symbol of Republican defiance against Biden’s handling of immigration. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, seized a park in the city earlier this year, shutting out U.S. Border Patrol agents who had long used it as a staging point.

Biden’s visit underscores his political vulnerability after enduring sustained Republican attacks over record levels of migrants at the border. Biden recently embraced a tough bipartisan Senate proposal on immigration, saying he would use its provisions to shut down the border if crossings reached a certain level.

Republicans, who had demanded that border enforcement measures be added to a foreign aid package, blocked the measure after opposition from Trump, who said he feared its passage would help Biden address a political liability.

Frustrated by Congress’s inaction, Biden has been considering executive actions that could limit unauthorized migration and restrict the asylum process, according to administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

It is not clear if Biden’s border visit — along with his potential executive actions and newly fiery rhetoric — can change the political dynamic on immigration. But the White House hopes a tougher stance can at a minimum blunt Republicans’ advantage on the issue.

A White House official said Biden on Thursday will “discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement” and “reiterate his calls for congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers” and other resources.

The president also will meet Thursday with Border Patrol agents, law enforcement officials and local political leaders, the official said. The Senate border compromise would have funded the hiring of thousands of Border Patrol and asylum officers, as well as increased detention capacity.

Trump and other Republicans have made it clear they will resist any effort by Biden to deflect the political damage caused by periodic scenes of chaos at the border over the past three years.

In a statement Monday, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt attacked Biden for his border visit, saying he “had three years to visit the border and fix the crisis he created” and suggesting that the president was only traveling there for political reasons.

“Now Biden’s handlers are sending him there on the same day as President Trump’s publicly reported trip, not because they actually want to solve the problem, but because they know Biden is losing terribly,” Leavitt said. “Biden’s last-minute, insincere attempt to chase President Trump to the border won’t cut it — Americans know Biden is single-handedly responsible for the worst immigration crisis in history and the ensuing Biden Migrant Crime Crisis affecting every community in our Country.”

The president’s actions, less than a month after he said he had “done all I can do” to secure the border unilaterally, reflect how the surge in migration continues to vex his administration. Biden in recent weeks has signaled a new willingness to take aggressive actions that have long been anathema to many Democrats.

Administration officials said last week that no final decisions had been made on possible executive actions and that it remained possible that Biden ultimately would not take such measures.

In December, record numbers of migrants surged to the border, though illegal border crossings have fallen 50 percent since then.

Trump, who attracted support for his first presidential run in 2016 in part with his harsh rhetoric on immigration, including a promise to build a border wall, is seeking to put the issue at the center of his current campaign as well.

The former president often has used dehumanizing language to describe undocumented immigrants, suggesting they have launched an “invasion” of the United States and accusing them of “poisoning the blood of the country,” language that has drawn comparisons with Nazi rhetoric.

Trump has taken credit for killing the Senate border compromise, which was hammered out by a bipartisan group of senators over a period of weeks. GOP lawmakers abandoned the deal after Trump said that such a measure “would be another Gift to the Radical Left Democrats.”

Polls show a majority of voters are unhappy with Biden’s handling of border issues.

A Monmouth University poll this month found that 71 percent of Americans disapproved of Biden’s handling of immigration and 26 percent approved. Disapproval of the president’s handling of immigration was 13 points higher than disapproval of his overall job performance, which is at 58 percent.

The same poll found 61 percent saying illegal immigration is a “very serious problem,” up from 46 percent in 2019 and 45 percent in 2015. While concern about the issue varies sharply by party, the level of concern was up among Democrats, Republicans and independents.

Biden, who at a fundraiser last week said the “border is in chaos,” has continued to hammer Republicans for tanking the bipartisan legislation, which would have provided more funding for border enforcement and given the president new authority to restrict migration.

The White House has touted the conservative Border Patrol union’s support for the bill and has continued to call on Republicans to pass the legislation, though its prospects seem dim. Without the benefit of additional funding in the legislation, White House aides say any executive order by Biden would have limited impact.

“Congressional Republicans chose to put partisan politics ahead of our national security, rejected what border agents have said they need, and then gave themselves a two-week vacation,” White House spokesman Angelo Fernández Hernández said in a statement Thursday, referring to a recent congressional recess.

“No executive action, no matter how aggressive, can deliver the significant policy reforms and additional resources Congress can provide and that Republicans rejected,” he added.

At the same time, Biden is facing pressure from progressives in his party unhappy about his apparent shift to the right on immigration.

“Doing Trump impressions isn’t how we beat Trump,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) posted last week on X, formerly known as Twitter, pointing to reports that Biden planned to use powers championed by Trump to block migrants from entering the country. “Seeking asylum is a legal right of all people. In the face of authoritarian threat, we should not buckle on our principles — we should commit to them.”

Trump, however, continued his onslaught against both Biden and undocumented immigrants.

“When I am your President, we will immediately Seal the Border, Stop the Invasion, and on Day One, we will begin the largest deportation operation of illegal CRIMINALS in American History!” he posted on Truth Social.

In that post, Trump referenced the recent killing of Laken Hope Riley, an Augusta University nursing student whose body was found on the University of Georgia campus. Jose Ibarra, who crossed the border illegally, has been taken into custody.

“Crooked Joe Biden’s INVASION is destroying our country and killing our citizens!” Trump wrote. “The horrible murder of 22-year-old Laken Riley at the University of Georgia should have NEVER happened!”

A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said Ibarra was arrested in September 2022 “after unlawfully entering the United States near El Paso, Texas,” and was “paroled and released for further processing.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), the conference’s nascent leader who has spent the past four months learning on the job while being pulled by opposite poles in his party, is once again days away from a government shutdown and staring down competing demands from his members. The conference is split almost down the middle on two pressing issues that Senate leaders and President Biden largely agree on: how to fund the government and sending aid to foreign democracies, particularly Ukraine.

As he faces two government shutdown deadlines over the next 10 days and pressure from all corners to aid Ukraine, Johnson has to weigh warring factors to either find consensus with bipartisan Senate leaders and the White House or cave to the far-right’s wishes to walk away from negotiations. The former could cost him his job.

But the lack of unity among House Republicans, whose first year in the majority was defined by their inability to agree on must-address issues, has weakened Johnson’s hand as he negotiates without a cohesive message on conservative demands. And many GOP lawmakers and aides said Johnson’s thinking is further complicated as he struggles to marry his own hard-line conservative ideology with his desire to govern.

Johnson has agreed with appropriators and other congressional leaders that they need to buy more time to pass funding bills through each chamber, proposing to Democrats late Tuesday the option to extend Friday’s deadline by a week and the March 8 deadline by two weeks, according to two people familiar with the offer. The deal, which the four congressional leaders and top appropriators agreed to Wednesday, is contingent on passing half of the 12 appropriations bills by next week, allowing for more time to work through more controversial funding legislation as Johnson aims to ensure this is the last short-term funding extension. The House is expected to vote on the stopgap measure on Thursday.

While Republican lawmakers acknowledge the unworkable position Johnson is in, concerns about Johnson’s “listen, then decide” approach have also amplified over the past month, leaving the conference feeling united in at least one thing: its disillusionment about a path forward.

Advertisement

“I have no confidence this ends well for House GOP,” said one House Republican, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about feelings within the conference.

The speaker’s allies argue that Johnson was put in an impossible position to lead a divided conference — a job he sought — and that the conference should unite behind him to strengthen his hands in negotiations. Johnson himself has been open publicly and in closed-door meetings with Republicans that there is only so much their two-seat majority can do if they remain fractured.

Complicating Johnson’s fate are the taunts from some lawmakers who have floated ousting him from the speakership — a move that would descend the House into further chaos, as it did last year when Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was removed. Detractors have decried another possible stopgap measure — the third in four months — that would extend current funding levels while giving appropriators more time to finish fiscal year funding bills, even though the group has contributed to the delay by moving the goal posts on their demands. They also are vehemently opposed to putting a Ukraine funding bill on the floor for a vote.

Members of the House Freedom Caucus also are angry with Johnson for trying to sell the previous stopgap measure as necessary to negotiate a number of conservative funding wins, only to tell lawmakers in a call last week to lower their expectations.

Advertisement

“I don’t think anybody on this call thinks that we’re going to be able to use the appropriations process to fundamentally remake major areas of policy,” Johnson told members on a Friday call, according to multiple people familiar with his comments. “If you’re expecting a lot of home runs and grand slams here, I admit you’ll be disappointed.”

Several Freedom Caucus members were critical for what they claimed was Johnson moving the goal post. After meeting with Johnson on Wednesday evening, Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), who chairs the group, said he would vote against the stopgap measure and hoped the speaker wouldn’t bring a bill to the floor that does not have a majority of Republican support.

Freedom Caucus members are instead pushing Johnson to pass an extension of current funding levels until Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year — a plan they initially were against — which would trigger a 7 to 10 percent cut in nondefense discretionary spending based on parameters agreed to by Biden and McCarthy in last year’s debt ceiling deal. But if lawmakers continue to use temporary funding extensions beyond April 30, that would instead trigger a 1 percent cut of current funding, which would include defense, veterans, Pell grants and other priorities that Democrats and Republicans — particularly defense hawks — are eager to avoid.

Freedom Caucus members have also made other demands. In a letter sent to the speaker last week, they listed almost two dozen requests they would want to see addressed in appropriation bills that would sour support for approval in the Senate. They included reducing Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’s salary to $0, defunding Planned Parenthood, ending “radical” climate change initiatives by the Biden administration and other culture war measures.

Pragmatic lawmakers have urged Johnson to ignore the demands of the far right, arguing that they are likely to still vote against any proposal Johnson makes because it isn’t conservative enough. The latter perspective paired with a razor-thin majority has forced GOP leadership to rely on Democratic votes to pass legislation, which further irritates the far-right flank.

In a floor speech Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that a shutdown “is entirely avoidable” and urged House Republicans to give up on culture war demands.

“I’ll say at the outset what I’ve said every time Congress has faced this threat: Shutting down the government is harmful to the country. And it never produces positive outcomes — on policy or politics,” McConnell said. “As always, the task at hand will require that everyone rows in the same direction: toward clean appropriations and away from poison pills.”

In a meeting with Biden on Tuesday, top Democratic leaders and Johnson all expressed optimism that the first four funding bills could broker a compromise soon. House Republicans are largely in agreement to avoid a government shutdown where many know their party would get blamed for being unable to govern, especially ahead of consequential primaries Tuesday.

But the fissures between House Republicans’ persistent demand to include border security in any Ukraine funding bill led to what was described by congressional leaders as an “intense” and “honest” meeting with Biden. Johnson said his purpose in the meeting, with leaders and then separately with Biden, was “to express what I believe is the obvious truth, and that is that we must take care of America’s needs first.” He added that he was “clear with the president and all those in the room that the House is actively pursuing and investigating all the various options” to fund Ukraine but that fixing the border remains the priority.

According to multiple people familiar with the meeting, Biden and the congressional leaders hammered Johnson for not prioritizing aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia. One of those people said Johnson told leaders that it wasn’t helpful to gang up on him for expressing a dominant opinion among his conference and that exerting more pressure on him to cave wouldn’t garner a different outcome.

“I think Speaker Johnson has a decision to make. Is he going to go down in history as Neville Chamberlain, or is he going to write his own story?” said Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.), the Democrat who brokered the Senate bipartisan border deal. “So he just has to make a decision if he wants to hand deliver Ukraine to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin as the lead story on his political obituary.”

Schumer said that after the meeting that Johnson wants to find a way to fund Ukraine but that he also “made it clear he’s in a difficult position in a caucus with a margin of two.” McConnell, who Democratic leaders said was animated in his defense of Ukraine even though Republicans in his conference are split on the issue, said his hope was that the House would consider the Senate supplemental funding bill aiding foreign democracies, warning that any changes made to it would result only in “further delays.”

“Not only do we not want to shut the government down, but we don’t want the Russians to win in Ukraine. And so, we have a time problem here,” McConnell said at his weekly news conference Tuesday. “The best way to move quickly and get the bill to the president is for the House to take up the Senate bill and pass it.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Below: President Biden issues an executive order on data security. First: The Supreme Court revives debate over whether social media is a ‘public square’ Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Reviewing the constitutionality of Florida and Texas laws that would restrict how online platforms can moderate users’ speech, the Supreme Court on Monday revived a long-standing debate: whether social media has become the new “public square.”

The court ruled long ago that states can’t intervene in the editorial decisions of newspapers to promote political balance. But attorneys for Florida and Texas argued on Monday that tech platforms are fundamentally different from newspapers. As forums that represent themselves as being open to the public, sites like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and X can be held to standards of neutrality and non-discrimination in the name of upholding users’ speech rights, they argued.

At least a few justices seemed sympathetic to the argument.

“I think we agree that the government couldn’t make editorial judgments about who can speak and what they can say in the public square,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said. “But what do you do with the fact that now, today, the Internet is the public square? And I appreciate that these companies are private companies, but if the speech now is occurring in this environment, why wouldn’t the same concerns about censorship apply?”

At various points, justices Neil M. Gorsuch, Samuel A. Alito and Clarence Thomas also signaled interest in the idea. Gorsuch suggested that social platforms present themselves as “open to all comers,” making them more like a telegraph than a newspaper.

But the public square analogy could also cut the other way.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. acknowledged Texas and Florida’s concern about the “market power and ability of social media platforms to control” online speech. But he expressed skepticism about the idea of substituting the “power of the state” for those private companies’ power.

“I wonder, since we’re talking about the First Amendment, whether our first concern should be with the state regulating what we have called the modern public square?” Roberts said. In other words, if online platforms have become so essential to free speech, that could be all the more reason for the government to be wary of intervening in their policies.

The question of social platforms’ market power came up repeatedly.

If a site like Facebook has become an essential communications tool, thanks to its vast scale, then excluding users from it could start to look more like censorship than editorial judgment. While the Texas and Florida laws were motivated by Republicans’ frustrations with Big Tech, some left-leaning groups also worry that online platforms have grown too powerful to be granted a First Amendment right to discriminate among viewpoints.

“These are the public squares, the only difference is they’re privately owned,” says Lee Hepner, legal counsel at the nonprofit American Economic Liberties Project. “And just because they’re privately owned does not mean they can discriminate and censor speech based on viewpoint.” He pointed to the court’s 1980 ruling in PruneYard v. Robins that a venue can be a public square for speech purposes even if it’s privately owned, as in the case of a shopping mall.

But today’s tumultuous social media landscape may make it harder to argue that any given platform is a public square unto itself.

Justice Elena Kagan pointed to the changes Elon Musk has wrought at Twitter, now called X, to highlight how different platforms create different environments for speech. “Twitter users one day woke up and found themselves to be X users, and the content rules had changed, and their feeds changed,” she said. “And all of a sudden they were getting a different online newspaper, so to speak, in a metaphorical sense every morning.”

Advertisement

In reaction, rival platforms for text-based feeds such as Meta’s Threads and Bluesky sprang up, with their own distinctive speech policies. Meanwhile, Facebook’s hold on the public sphere arguably has been eroded by the rise of TikTok and its emergence as a force in politics and culture. It’s a point Roberts alluded to when he called social media “an incredibly dynamic market.”

NetChoice attorney Paul Clement said it would be one thing if Facebook could limit your access to the wider internet, like a cable company. But it doesn’t have that power. “There’s always a way to access the public square,” he said.

In other words, the true digital public square is not Facebook, YouTube or X, but the internet as a whole.

Mary Anne Franks, a First Amendment scholar at George Washington University Law School, says there are “many reasons to be concerned about the way that social media dominates people’s lives.” But she said that “the answer to those concerns is not to treat private companies as if they were governments.”

Advertisement

“A private square remains a private square no matter how popular it gets,” she said. “And, as we have seen in the last few years, there is not one private square, but a growing variety of private squares that people can migrate to and from or abandon altogether.”

As Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it: “The one thing I know about the internet is that its variety is infinite.”

Biden issues order blocking bulk sale of DNA, location data to foreign buyers

President Biden on Wednesday issued an executive order designed to block the bulk transfer of Americans’ most sensitive data to buyers in China and other “countries of concern,” my colleague Drew Harwell reports for The Tech 202.

The order, which the White House called “the most significant executive action any President has ever taken to protect Americans’ data security,” directs the Justice Department to establish clear protections for biometric, financial, genomic, geolocation and health data, some of which is legally sold by commercial data brokers. The process has for years fueled concern that the personal information could be collected by foreign governments or militaries for use in blackmail or espionage.



Harwell and Ellen Nakashima previously broke news of the impending order here.

Competing public health concerns are at the heart of a Supreme Court case on homeless encampments

Homelessness is a soaring public health crisis, with a record 653,000 unhoused people in the United States, according to federal estimates . Tent and recreational vehicle encampments have exploded in recent years, crowding streets and sidewalks from Portland, Ore., to New York . In California, where roughly a third of all the nation’s homeless people live, doctors are scheduling appointments at encampments to treat widespread chronic disease, rampant drug abuse and mental illness — health conditions that worsen with homelessness.

In April, the U.S. Supreme Court will delve into an issue central to the plight of those living in homeless encampments: whether they can be fined or slapped with criminal charges for living or sleeping outdoors when there’s no shelter or housing available.

The situation on the streets is causing major political upheaval. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is plowing $750 million into clearing encampments — with the elusive promise of shelter — while homeless advocates fight to stop it. But it’s a small city in Oregon called Grants Pass that took the battle to the Supreme Court.

City of Grants Pass v. Johnson centers on whether it’s cruel and unusual punishment to impose fines and criminal citations for camping or sleeping outside, which is against the law in many cities. Some homeless advocates fear the court’s conservative majority will give carte blanche to state and local officials to sweep encampments in the name of public health and safety.

Newsom is asking California voters to approve a $6.4 billion bond to create thousands of new homeless housing units and behavioral health treatment beds to get people off the streets. But he argued in an amicus brief that clearing encampments should be allowed and that it can help provide services to unhoused people living in “inhumane conditions,” he said. “The courts have tied the hands of state and local governments.”

He and other public officials also argue that encampments harm public health; a 2016-2018 outbreak of hepatitis A in San Diego linked to homelessness resulted in nearly 600 infections and 20 deaths .

Yet a growing body of evidence suggests sweeps can worsen the health of people in encampments while causing turmoil in their lives and for the people trying to care for them — potentially costing taxpayer-funded Medicaid programs even more money.

Advertisement

A study published last year in JAMA also found that displacing homeless people from encampments can lead to higher hospitalizations — raising health-care costs — and cause serious infections and early death.

“Sweeps prolong homelessness — you can make them disappear from this corner or that corner, but they’re just going to appear somewhere else,” said Eric Tars, senior policy director for the National Homelessness Law Center. “If you want to follow public health approaches, what we need to be doing is getting more people into housing, which evidence shows improves health.”

Sweeps also hurt fragile relationships between homeless people and their caregivers.

“A lot of people on the streets with mental illness live with the fear that anyone who’s trying to help them might get them hospitalized against their will or put in jail,” said Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness . “So when encampments are being cleared by law enforcement, it totally upends people’s lives and violates that trust in a way that they’re going to be more resistant to help.”

But with housed Americans in both parties clamoring for their streets to be safer and cleaner, the health concerns of homeless people aren’t always a priority for politicians.

Senate Democrats look to put Republicans on IVF defense

On tap today: On Capitol Hill, a group of Senate Democrats will try to force a vote on a bill aimed at codifying access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other fertility treatments in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are people .

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who conceived both her daughters through IVF, plans to call on her colleagues to pass her Access to Family Building Act through unanimous consent. She attempted the same maneuver in 2022, but Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) swiftly blocked it .

Reality check: Senate conservative are likely to once again scuttle the vote. But for Democrats the procedural move is a chance to put Republicans’ opposition to federal protections for fertility treatments on the record, further elevating the issue as election season intensifies.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.):

Without the miracle of IVF, I likely wouldn't have my two beautiful girls—and I know I'm not alone.



Tomorrow, I will head to the floor and call on my colleagues to pass my legislation through unanimous consent so we can protect access to IVF nationwide. pic.twitter.com/OTeU93GFQT — Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) February 27, 2024

Meanwhile, across the Capitol …

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) is circulating a nonbinding resolution to House members in both parties expressing “strong support for continued access to fertility care,” Axios’s Andrew Solender reports.

According to Mace, the five-page measure is meant to “build consensus” as she prepares IVF-related legislation.

And in Alabama …

Republican lawmakers in Alabama introduced a pair of companion bills yesterday that would shield IVF providers from both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, the Alabama Reflector’s Jemma Stephenson reports.

The proposed legislation doesn’t attempt to define the point at which human life begins, after bill sponsors scrapped draft language that referred to embryos as “potential life” unless implanted in the uterus.

Next steps: Lawmakers are aiming to fast-track the bills through the state Senate and House within five days, the minimum time frame required to send legislation to Republican Gov. Kay Ivey’s desk for consideration.

The Biden administration has initiated an antitrust probe into the nation’s largest health insurer, Anna Wilde Mathews and Dave Michaels report for the Wall Street Journal.

The details: Justice Department investigators have been actively interviewing industry insiders in recent weeks, particularly those in sectors where UnitedHealth Group competes, according to people familiar with the matter.

The conversations have included questions about the relationship between the company’s insurance unit and its health services arm, Optum .

Additionally, investigators have asked about the effects of UnitedHealth's extensive acquisitions of doctor groups on both competitors and consumers.

Key context: This isn’t the first time the insurance giant has faced scrutiny from federal antitrust authorities. In September 2022, UnitedHealth successfully defeated a challenge mounted by the Justice Department over its acquisition of Change Healthcare.

How Josh Shapiro thinks Biden can win back Arab Americans

Five questions for … Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro: We sat down with Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor, a member of the Biden campaign’s advisory board, to discuss how President Biden can win the crucial swing state this year.

Polls show a close race. A Quinnipiac University poll found Biden leading former president Donald Trump by three points in January, while a New York Times-Siena College poll late last year found Trump leading Biden by four points.

This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.

The Early: You’ve pointed out that Democrats have been running strong in Pennsylvania in the Biden era. You won by almost 15 points. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman won by almost five points in 2022. Daniel McCaffery won a state Supreme Court race last year by almost seven points. Why is the presidential race in Pennsylvania so close?

Shapiro: Let’s go back and look at the last two presidential contests. In Pennsylvania, it was settled by 44,000 votes in 2016 and 80,000 votes in 2020. I would expect it’s going to be close again. I frankly don’t pay a whole lot of attention to the polling now because we haven’t run a campaign yet. The race hasn’t really joined. My optimism is centered around the fact that Pennsylvanians have consistently voted for freedom and against Donald Trump-style extremism — and the president's got a good story to tell.

The Early: One bright spot for Biden in the Quinnipiac poll was that he was winning White voters who have college degrees by 25 points. That’s a much bigger margin than he won them by in 2020. On the flip side, the poll showed him struggling with Black voters compared to 2020. Do you have any insight into that divide?

Shapiro: I don’t look at Pennsylvanians that way. I don’t slice them and dice them into the kind of categories that maybe a poll does.

We’re looking at how to help communities all across Pennsylvania — Black, White, Latino, rich, poor, rural, urban, suburban — and focus less on what their degree of education is and instead focus on making sure everybody’s got opportunity to succeed. My first day in office, I signed an executive order doing away with the college degree requirement for 92 percent of state government jobs. It’s like 66,000 jobs or so. After one year, it led us to hiring — 60 percent of our new hires don’t have a college degree. The point behind this was really twofold. No. 1, to attract really talented people to work for us in state government. But, No. 2, to make clear we’re going to value skills, we’re going to value experience — military experience, workforce experience. We're not going to have arbitrary degree requirements get in the way.

The Early: There’s a lot of concern about Biden’s support with Arab American voters in Michigan. Pennsylvania has the second-highest share of Arab Americans of any swing state. What are you hearing from them about Biden's handling of the war in Gaza?

Shapiro: I meet with our Arab American, Muslim American neighbors; Palestinian Christians; others who were really impacted by this. I’ve met with them privately in my office in the Capitol. I've spoken to them over the phone. I understand the pain that they feel.

We’ve lost around 30,000 people in Gaza. Of course, this all started because 1,200 Israelis were murdered by Hamas, a designated terrorist group, in an unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation. We can’t forget the genesis of this, but we also can’t ignore the death and the destruction that’s occurred in Gaza. For those who are peacefully protesting, I support their right to do that and I’ll defend that, and I want to make sure they feel heard. And I think in Pennsylvania, they do feel heard.

The Early: What can the Biden campaign do to convince those voters not to stay home in November or to vote for Trump?

Shapiro: We need a solution that ends the war. We need every hostage to be returned home. We need Hamas to no longer be in power, whether that’s because they're defeated or put into exile. And there needs to be a meaningful conversation toward a two-state solution. And ideally, that conversation would happen with an Israeli government that is not led by [Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a destructive force for Israel over time.

I hope that with a better situation in the Middle East, combined with a clear and sober look at the two choices that they have — Donald Trump and Joe Biden — that at the end of the day my Arab American, Muslim American neighbors will understand that the stakes are just too high to either vote for Donald Trump or to stay home.

Advertisement

The Early: Pennsylvania hasn’t received the same influx of migrants in recent months as Colorado or Illinois or New York. How potent an issue do you think it will be in Pennsylvania in November?

Shapiro: Immigration is an important issue to many people in Pennsylvania and across the country — and it should be. It's an important issue to me. We need to secure our border. We need to make sure there is a path to citizenship for those who are here. And we need to clear rules of the road for those who want to migrate to this country.

I think it is shameful that we had an opportunity to pass a bipartisan bill on immigration and Donald Trump chose to put himself before country, as he always does, and inject more chaos into our immigration system by telling Republican sycophants to be against this in the House of Representatives. And that pathetic, sad sack of a speaker, instead of doing what our country needs — which is to secure our border — decided to pledge his allegiance not to the flag but to Donald Trump. And as a result, we are all worse off.

[Ed.: Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has criticized the border deal negotiated by Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) as insufficient and has urged Biden to act without Congress. “The president has authority to do something and he won't,” Johnson told reporters Thursday.]

White House Notebook

The private chats and chance encounters that change Joe Biden’s thinking

White House reporter Tyler Pager files this week’s White House Notebook:

Today, The Washington Post is publishing Part 1 of “How Biden Leads,” my new series scrutinizing President Biden’s leadership style and how he has run the most complex government in the world, as he asks voters to return him to the White House for a second term.

Part 1 focuses on how Biden absorbs information, revealing how the president, to a remarkable degree, relies on direct personal interaction. From near-daily conversations with his grandchildren to talks with fellow parishioners after Mass to exchanges with workers on his property in Wilmington, Del., Biden brings their worries to the Oval Office.

One example, from the story:

In the early months of his presidency, as the pandemic dragged on with its stifling restrictions, President Biden often delivered a favorite monologue to aides: He was worried about young people’s mental health, he said. High school seniors were missing prom and graduation. He wanted to know how college students went on dates. Specifically, Biden wondered how young people could “make love” under the circumstances, according to two aides who heard the president use that phrase multiple times during his first year in office. Biden’s fixation on loneliness among young people, the aides said, grew out of his near-daily conversations with his grandchildren. Biden brought those concerns to Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy, who had written a book on loneliness, and encouraged him to prioritize the issue. Last May, Murthy released a National Strategy to Advance Social Connection, accompanied by guidance “calling attention to the public health crisis of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection in our country.”

Now in his fourth year in office, Biden has compiled an extensive record as chief executive of the most powerful organization in the world. Voters’ judgment on how he has filled that role will be critical as they decide whether they grant him a second term. The Washington Post is examining three pillars of Biden’s leadership — how he absorbs information, how he makes decisions and how he talks to Americans — based on interviews with more than 100 current and former White House staffers, political allies and adversaries, and close friends of the president.

The result is a rare portrait of a very private president based on details and incidents that have not been previously reported. The White House declined to make Biden available for an interview.

At the White House

The government will be open for the State of the Union

The good news is that the government will not be shutdown during Biden's State of the Union address next Thursday as Congress last night extended government funding until next Friday, March 8.

Team Biden is already gearing up for the address that will be as much a campaign speech this election year as a status report of the country's affairs.

The president will tout his accomplishments in his first three years and highlight his efforts to protect Democracy and reproductive rights, according to a White House official.

But he'll also look ahead to a potential second term, where he will vow bipartisan wins on fentanyl, veterans issues and Big Tech, which he calls the “unity agenda.”

The White House, working to gain as much awareness of the speech as possible, will continue to roll out themes and excerpts of the address throughout next week.

What we're watching

From the courts

Today is another big court day for the former president and Republican front-runner.

U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who is overseeing the classified documents case, will hold the first public proceeding since November. She is expected to push back the previously scheduled start from May 20. Federal prosecutors on Thursday requested a July 8 start date, while Trump’s lawyers asked to delay the trial until 2025 — after the next presidential election. The proceeding starts at 10 a.m. and is expected run through the afternoon. Trump and his co-defendants, longtime aide Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago staffer Carlos De Oliveira, are expected to attend the hearing.

“Among the topics of discussion: Trump’s requests that the government produce more material for them to review as potential evidence, including emails and other documents that defense lawyers say could show political motivations for the prosecution of Biden’s probable general election opponent,” Trump’s requests that the government produce more material for them to review as potential evidence, including emails and other documents that defense lawyers say could show political motivations for the prosecution of Biden’s probable general election opponent,” per our colleagues Perry Stein and Devlin Barrett . “Cannon is also expected to discuss whether the names of witnesses and others involved in the case should be made public — the subject of a long battle between the two parties.”

Hundreds of miles away in Georgia, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee will hear closing arguments on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis should be disqualified from the state’s election interference case against Trump. Willis is accused of having an improper personal relationship with Nathan Wade, the lead prosecutor she hired to oversee the case.

What McAfee decides, “and when, could affect not only the outcome of a major criminal case against Trump but also whether that case proceeds before the presidential election in November, when Trump is expected to face off against Biden,” could affect not only the outcome of a major criminal case against Trump but also whether that case proceeds before the presidential election in November, when Trump is expected to face off against Biden,” USA Today’s Josh Meyer reports . “The bottom line, legal experts say, is that while Willis is very unlikely to be disqualified based on a strict interpretation of Georgia law, the time spent on hearing evidence about her affair with Wade threatens to push the actual election fraud trial back to either right before — or after — Election Day.”

No one wants to be the person tasked with suggesting that, anecdotal examples of horrible crimes notwithstanding, trends aren’t as bleak as they seem. Just as the conflation of anecdotes with trends triggered the need for the nuance, the nuance invariably suffers the same fate: It is presented as minimizing the anecdote rather than the trend.

But sometimes the nuance is important, even in the face of a particularly horrible criminal act.

Last week, Donald Trump sat down with Fox News host Laura Ingraham for a scattershot conversation about national politics. At one point, Trump was asked how, if he wins the presidency this year, he would go about finding undocumented immigrants to deport.

Trump said he would enlist local police. Then he pivoted to suggest that those immigrants were particularly dangerous — so dangerous that he had invented a “new category” of criminal activity.

“I don’t know if you’ve heard this, but I came up with this one,” he told Ingraham. “Migrant crime. This crime — there’s violent crime, there’s migrant crime. We have a new category of crime. It’s called migrant crime. And it’s going to be worse than any other form of crime.”

This is an unexpected claim from Trump, certainly, given that his 2016 presidential bid was focused on the same purported threat. He announced his candidacy in June 2015 with the declaration that foreign countries were willfully sending dangerous criminals into the United States over the border with Mexico. It was, in fact, the trigger for his eventual success in the Republican nominating fight, showing his willingness to buck conventional Republican qualms about making false claims about the dangers of immigrants. Trump repeatedly invoked the killing of a woman named Kate Steinle by an immigrant in the country illegally as anecdotal proof of this threat.

Once inaugurated, his administration continued to suggest that immigrants were particularly dangerous. An office focused on criminal activity by immigrants was created, and the administration for a time issued updates on that activity. But at no point was there evidence that immigrants, undocumented or not, committed crimes more often than native-born Americans. In fact, analysis repeatedly showed that they were less likely to do so.

Advertisement

But, again, there was political utility for Trump in suggesting the opposite. At the time, his party was largely skeptical, and deservedly so, but the focus on immigration activated a far-right base of support that has stuck with Trump since. And, thanks to years of repetition of that rhetoric by Trump and his allies, Republicans now broadly think that immigrants in the country illegally are more likely to engage in violent crime.

Share this article Share

Polling released by Monmouth University on Monday morning shows that nearly two-thirds of Republicans hold that view. Over time, that has helped push higher the percentage of the overall population that thinks immigrants commit more violent crimes as well. From 2015 to 2019, Monmouth found that at least half of respondents said that immigrants in the country illegally were no more likely than Americans overall to commit violent crimes. Now only a third of respondents hold that view.

Again, this has historically not been the case. And it is hard to say whether this is the case now.

Advertisement

Data on U.S. crime is collected in real time only in a piecemeal fashion, as we’ve written before. Generally, we learn about national trends only after annual data has been gathered and published, a process that takes months.

This gap has proved to be fertile ground for crafting anecdote-based narratives about crime. In the months before the 2022 midterm elections, for example, Fox News repeatedly hyped the idea that crime was surging, cherry-picking categories and locations to create an unending stream of horror stories. As it turned out, the data for 2022 showed that violent crime had declined the previous year. But we only learned that conclusively in late 2023.

Crime committed by immigrants is even harder to quantify, given that the immigration status of alleged criminal perpetrators is not always collected. When the New York Times recently tried to evaluate whether the increase in immigrants entering the United States was affecting crime in New York City, it found no evidence that it was — while recognizing the aforementioned limitation.

Advertisement

The paper was doing so in part because of a high-profile incident in which a group of immigrants fought several police officers in Times Square. That incident was not as clear-cut as it was initially presented in the media — and certainly not as clear-cut as the scores of mentions of it on Fox News in the past month might have suggested.

But Fox News, particularly since Trump first focused on this question in June 2015, has been hyperactive in discussing the idea that there is a link between immigration and crime. Fox has mentioned immigrants and crime 125 percent more than CNN and MSNBC combined since June 2015. Fox Business — ostensibly a business-focused channel — has mentioned it more than CNN or MSNBC.

Fox News has never mentioned it more often than this month.

Again, there is no evidence that immigrants in the country illegally have historically committed more violent crimes, and there is no evidence that such immigrants are committing more violent crimes. There is, however, obvious evidence that some immigrants have committed some crimes, and there is an obvious pattern of right-wing voices elevating those crimes, contributing to and reflecting the widespread belief among Republicans that immigrants are more likely to commit violent crimes. There also is an obvious motivation to do so by Trump, just as there was in 2015: suggesting to American voters that a Democratic administration is endangering their lives.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Dr. Kevin O’Connor, Biden’s physician, wrote that the president is adjusting well to a new device that helps control his sleep apnea and has experienced some hip discomfort but also works out five times per week.

“President Biden is a healthy, active, robust, 81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency,” O’Connor said in a six-page memo on the president’s health, following a physical that took Biden to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for more than 2 1/2 hours.

His memo added that Biden “feels well and this year’s physical identifies no new concerns.”

The oldest president in U.S. history, Biden would be 86 by the end of a second term, should he win one. His latest physical mirrored one he had in February last year when O’Connor described Biden as “healthy, vigorous” and “fit” to handle his White House duties.

Still, voters are approaching this year’s election with misgivings about Biden’s age, having scrutinized his gaffes, his coughing, his slow walking and even a tumble off his bicycle.

After he returned to the White House on Wednesday, Biden attended an event on combating crime and suggested that when it came to his health “everything is squared away” and “there is nothing different than last year.”

He also joked about his age and people thinking “I look too young.”

Former President Donald Trump, 77, is the favorite to lock up the Republican nomination later this month, which would bring him closer to a November rematch against Biden. Trump was 70 when he took office in 2017, which made him the oldest American president to be inaugurated — until Biden broke his record by being inaugurated at 78 in 2021.

O’Connor’s report said that Biden’s stiff walking was no worse than last year and was the result of arthritic changes in his spine. He said the president also noted “some increased left hip discomfort.” There were no signs of stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s or other similar conditions in what the report called an “extremely detailed neurologic exam.”

Biden, last summer, began using a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine at night to help with sleep apnea, and O’Connor wrote that the president had responded well to that treatment and is “diligently compliant” about using it.

A recent special counsel’s report on the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents repeatedly derided Biden’s memory, calling it “hazy,” “fuzzy,” “faulty,” “poor” and having “significant limitations.” It also noted that Biden could not recall defining milestones in his own life such as when his son Beau died or when he served as vice president.

Advertisement

Still, addressing reporters the evening of the report’s release, Biden said “my memory is fine” and grew visibly angry as he denied forgetting when his son died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that O’Connor was one of a team of 20 different medical specialists who helped complete the physical.

Asked why Biden wasn’t undergoing a cognitive test as part of the physical, Jean-Pierre said that O’Connor and Biden’s neurologist “don’t believe he needs one.”

“He passes a cognitive test every day, every day as he moves from one topic to another topic, understanding the granular level of these topics,” Jean-Pierre said, noting that Biden tackled such diverse issues as Wednesday’s crime prevention event before his planned trip to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday and next week’s State of the Union address.

“This is a very rigorous job,” she added.

That picture of the president doesn’t reflect the type of struggles with routine tasks that might indicate the need for further tests, said Dr. Michael Rosenbloom, a neurologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

“Constantly questioning older folks who may have an occasional lapse is a form of ageism,” Rosenbloom said.

From sleep apnea to arthritis, Biden’s health report “seems pretty run of the mill for an 81-year-old person,” said Dr. Jeffrey A. Linder, chief of general internal medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.

“His doctors are in a unique position to assess his cognitive ability on a daily basis,” Linder said. “These doctors are able to see how he’s functioning day to day. That’s much more useful” than a cognitive assessment.

Many Americans, including Democrats, have expressed reservations about Biden seeking a second term during this fall’s election. Only 37% of Democrats say Biden should pursue reelection, down from 52% before the 2022 midterm elections, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Biden counters that his age brings wisdom, and he has begun to criticize Trump for the former president’s recent public gaffes.

The president joked that his age was classified information and suggested during a taping in New York on Monday of “Late Night With Seth Meyers ″ that Trump mistakenly called his wife Melania, “Mercedes” during a weekend speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference -- though the Trump campaign says he was correctly referring to political commentator Mercedes Schlapp.

Trump has indeed had his share of verbal miscues, mixing up the city and state where he was campaigning, calling Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the leader of Turkey and repeatedly mispronouncing the militant group Hamas as “hummus.” More recently, he confused his Republican primary rival Nikki Haley with former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

While he was president, Trump’s annual physical in 2019 revealed that he had gained weight and was up to 243 pounds. With his 6-foot, 3-inch frame, that meant Trump’s Body Mass Index was 30.4. An index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone obese under this commonly used formula.

Wednesday’s report listed Biden as 6-foot tall and weighing 178 pounds.

Why McConnell's exit endangers the old GOP

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s announcement that he will not run for Republican leader again in November (but will finish out his Senate term) is a monumental moment for the chamber — and a pivotal juncture for the Republican Party.

McConnell has a long legacy of deep partisanship, drawing the ire of liberals for decades on issues of campaign finance, the Supreme Court (especially over his refusal take up the nomination of Merrick Garland) and Senate obstruction, leading to derogatory monikers such as the “Grim Reaper” (which he embraced) and “Moscow Mitch” (which he loathed).

Advertisement

But in recent years, McConnell became the final backstop against a complete Trumpification of the GOP as the party changed in front of him. McConnell has no relationship with Trump. He hasn’t uttered his name in years.

The longest-serving Senate leader still carries the dimming torch of Reagan Republicanism, advocating for American intervention in foreign affairs and a mighty defense. On domestic policy, he has also resisted at times the increasingly populist tendencies of the Trump faction — even as his personal poll numbers among Republicans are on a steady decline. (He has said he will support the Republican nominee, and Trump is close to being that.)

Now Republicans will elect their first new leader since McConnell succeeded Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) in 2007.

“It’s a clean break and a new day after a couple of decades for all of us to sort of unite,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said.

McConnell continues to fight for aid to Ukraine, a legacy-defining issue for him that he says will have major consequences for decades to come. He lost more than half of his conference on a recent vote to provide $60 billion in aid to Kyiv.

“Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time. I have many faults; misunderstanding politics is not one of them,” McConnell said in speech on the Senate floor, acknowledging that he is no longer the Republican standard-bearer.

Whom Senate Republicans choose to succeed McConnell — which they’ll decide after the November elections — will be about the direction of the party as much as about the person.

The race between the Johns

The three people most likely to run to replace McConnell — Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Barrasso of Wyoming and John Cornyn of Texas — each represent different factions of the party. The outcome will determine whether Senate Republicans are led by a traditional McConnell-like Republican or a party realignment ensues. (It’s a similar battle to the one taking place in the Republican primaries between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley.)

While no one has announced, the race has begun. Our colleague Paul Kane writes: “Some suggested that, behind the scenes, the potential successors have fully launched their bids. ‘I’ve had a lot of calls today,’ Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters late Wednesday.”

John Thune

Thune, McConnell’s No. 2, is most aligned with him. McConnell was instrumental in convincing a reluctant Thune to run for reelection in 2022.

While McConnell hasn't weighed in on a potential successor, he has been passing off responsibility to Thune, most recently deputizing him early in the fall to oversee border security negotiations as part of the national security supplemental.

Washington Post Live last year, “I hope to have other options” than Trump for the Republican nomination. He endorsed Trump earlier this week. Thune, however, doesn’t have much of a relationship with Trump and has never been a fan. He said onlast year, “I hope to have other options” than Trump for the Republican nomination. He endorsed Trump earlier this week.

John Barrasso

Barrasso hails from a state that backed Trump in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other. His politics reflect that. He is the most aligned with the Republican base and has built relationships and trust with the younger, more populist members of the Republican conference, who have been increasingly vocal against McConnell.

He often splits with McConnell and the rest of leadership on key votes. He opposed the national security supplemental that would have provided $60 billion for Ukraine, and he did not vote to raise the debt limit in June. He was the first among Senate leadership to endorse Trump.

Barrasso will travel to Arizona today to attend a rally for Kari Lake, an election denier running for Senate.

John Cornyn

Cornyn’s posture is between Barrasso and Thune. He is close with McConnell and served in leadership positions until he was term-limited out after six years as whip. Cornyn aligns with McConnell at times and enters into bipartisan negotiations at others but is ideologically on the more conservative end of the spectrum.

Cornyn will tout his fundraising prowess in a potential run for leader. He has consistently been a strong fundraiser and has pulled in $13 million this cycle for incumbents, Senate candidates and the NRSC, according to a person familiar with his apparatus.

His relationship with Trump is cordial, but one person who has spoken to the former president about the merits of different Republican senators — although not about the race to succeed McConnell specifically — told us Trump would “freak out” if Cornyn was leader.

There are also the McConnell foes who could make a play for leader, including Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who received 10 votes in a 2022 challenge to the leader. Scott has aligned himself with the most conservative wing of the House, setting up bicameral meetings with the House Freedom Caucus and like-minded senators. It’s unclear whether he could command any additional support.

The Trump factor

Trump could weigh in on whom he’d prefer, but it’s unclear how much weight his endorsement would have in an anonymous leadership election. Trump is much better at destroying a candidate’s chances than propelling a candidate to victory.

He endorsed Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) for speaker after Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) ouster last year, but Jordan wasn’t able to secure the votes. Trump did, however, sink Rep. Tom Emmer's (R-Minn.) bid for speaker.

What we're watching

On the Hill

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will appear before the House Armed Services Committee today as part of the panel’s probe into the “Pentagon’s secrecy after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, underwent surgery and was rushed back to a hospital for a second stay without disclosing any of those details to the White House for days,” our colleagues Dan Lamothe and Abigail Hauslohner report.

Austin, who has faced calls to resign over his secrecy, is likely to be grilled intensely about his decision-making during the episode.

From the courts

We’re still waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on whether Trump should be barred from the ballot in Colorado.

The justices heard oral arguments in Anderson v. Griswold this month, and a ruling could come any day. Illinois became the third state — after Maine and Colorado — to remove Trump from its primary ballot on Wednesday when Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie R. Porter ruled that the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding office applied to Trump.

Griswold is one of “three cases before the Supreme Court that could directly impact Trump’s legal and political future,” our colleague Ann E. Marimow writes. The court announced Wednesday that it would review Trump’s unprecedented claim that he is shielded from prosecution for actions taken while in office. That case is Trump v. U.S.

At the White House

Biden and Trump visits to Texas offer a tale of two border cities

Happening today: Biden and Trump will make competing trips to two Texas border towns today as part of the broader effort to address and blame the other for a crisis at the border. The surge in migration is an issue that has been a political boon for the Republican front-runner and a vulnerability for the incumbent. Here’s what to expect:

Biden will travel to Brownsville, a Democratic stronghold in the Rio Grande Valley. Biden, alongside Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Tex.) and others, will meet with Border Patrol agents, law enforcement officials and local political leaders. He will also deliver a speech calling out Republicans for blocking a bipartisan bill that would have provided billions of dollars in additional funding for border security and given him new authorities to restrict asylum claims.

Advertisement

U.S. Customs and Border Protection sector that has long seen the highest levels of migration,” our colleague Brownsville will be the backdrop for the speech. “The Gulf Coast port city is nestled within thesector that has long seen the highest levels of migration,” our colleague Arelis R. Hernández writes . “But even when border crossings surge, the shocks are quietly absorbed. Residents donate supplies and help orient the new arrivals on how to navigate their way to their final destinations.”

Trump, meanwhile, will visit Eagle Pass, a city 300 miles upriver from Brownsville that has become a symbol of Republican defiance against Biden’s handling of immigration. “Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has transformed the riverfront community into a military front line on immigration. Razor wire and rusted shipping containers warn migrants to stay away. And military trucks and rifle-carrying troops occupy the city’s biggest park.”

As Biden and Trump head to Texas today, “the cities each has chosen to plant their flag on immigration are a study of contrasts,” Arelis writes. “While both hug the Rio Grande, that’s about where the similarities end. Their common origin stories — riverfront military garrisons that grew into bicultural communities — have each diverged in ways that reflect the dynamics of this contested and polemical region.”

Brownsville: “The city of nearly 190,000 residents devotes its own resources — with help from federal grants — to move migrants quickly to other places where friends and loved ones await them. And as fences, a towering wall and Border Patrol agents have cemented their presence along the Rio Grande, a network of faith-based and civic non-governmental organizations on both sides of the border has also sprung up. They work closely with U.S. authorities to create as orderly a system as possible to help when the number of people crossing climbs.”

Eagle Pass: “The Abbott administration reacted to the city’s anxieties in a way several local officials said the Biden administration has not. Many, they said, felt abandoned by the federal government. Some residents are nostalgic for Trump, whom they view as tougher on illegal migration. … Eagle Pass, in essence, has become occupied territory. State troops “The Abbott administration reacted to the city’s anxieties in a way several local officials said the Biden administration has not. Many, they said, felt abandoned by the federal government. Some residents are nostalgic for Trump, whom they view as tougher on illegal migration. … Eagle Pass, in essence, has become occupied territory. State troops seized Shelby Park — a critical stretch of riverfront land — and shut out U.S. Border Patrol agents. City leaders voted not to pursue legal action because they can’t afford it.”

The campaign

What the early primaries tell us about Trump’s changing base

Our colleagues Dan Keating, Adrián Blanco and Derek Hawkins examine how Trump’s voters have shifted since his first presidential run. The analysis “paints a picture of a base that’s more homogenous than the one that backed him as the GOP nominee eight years ago,” our colleagues write. “Trump’s increasingly extreme positions and rhetoric have clearly alienated more moderate voting blocs while attracting voters from the party’s right flank and allowing him to maintain support in other key groups.”

Here are two ways Trump’s base has changed since 2016:

Trump’s base is older: “One of the most pronounced shifts is in the age of Trump’s base,” our colleagues write. “Voters 65 and over made up a minority of his base in 2016. This year, they’re the largest group in terms of age. Young Republicans have turned from him. Voters under 40 accounted for 37 percent of his base at this point in the 2016 campaign; now, they make up less than 29 percent. His share of middle-aged voters is also down, falling from nearly 40 percent to about 35 percent.”

Women have stuck with Trump: “The overturning of Roe v. Wade and the ending of the constitutional right to an abortion has already cost the Republican Party. But in the early primaries, it doesn’t appear to have hurt Trump’s standing among Republican women, who made up a slightly larger share of his base than eight years ago.”

There’s former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, of course, who wants to convince potential donors that their contributions to her presumptively doomed bid for the nomination aren’t wasted money. This means convincing those donors that her ongoing campaign has value — either as a pathway to the nomination (which is extraordinarily unlikely) or in otherwise damaging Trump’s effort to regain the presidency.

Then there are some in the media who, through muscle memory or overindulgence in Haley’s campaign rhetoric, present the nominating fight as one that follows the recent trajectory (see: 2008, 2012, 2016) of being uncertain until well into the election year. And of course, there are those anti-Trump augurs who sift through the exit polls to see what bad news for the Republican front-runner they can discern.

Advertisement

The reality is that the nominating contest is a contest only in the same sense that a football game is when one team is up by 50 points at halftime: You do technically have to let the clock run out. What’s more, the result of the Republican primaries to date are not indicative of a fervent Republican skepticism about Trump.

This election year offers an uncommon scenario. It is functionally a fight between two incumbents — and two broadly unpopular incumbents, at that. The Democratic nominating contest, featuring the literal incumbent president, has avoided any real challenge to the front-runner as primary dates have passed. A year ago, the Republican contest seemed as though it might be a real fight. But the combination of Trump’s Manhattan indictment — which galvanized Republican support for his candidacy — and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) remarkably unsuccessful challenge meant that Trump was the near-certain nominee before 2024 began.

Since last fall, in fact, the level of support President Biden and Trump have seen in 538’s national polling averages has been similar. At this point, each candidate is the preferred candidate of three-quarters of his party.

Biden and Trump are each doing worse than Trump was in early 2020, when he was often at or above 90 percent in primary polling. But it’s hard to see how Trump’s failure to match where he was four years ago is much more damaging to his candidacy than Biden’s failure to do so is to his.

Advertisement

Haley has repeatedly framed the non-Trump vote in nominating contests as a measure of hostility to Trump. That she has received more than 40 percent of the vote in New Hampshire and South Carolina, the argument goes, shows how robust the opposition is to Trump within his party. For the tea-leaf readers, this suggests a softness that might translate to apathy in November that hurts Trump’s chances.

Maybe. But much of that opposition comes from independents, not Republicans. In New Hampshire, for example, most of Haley’s support came from non-Republicans. In South Carolina — the state where she was once a popular governor — about 3 in 5 votes she received came from Republicans, according to exit polling.

Exit polling also shows that Trump now consistently gets more support from Republicans than he did until late in the 2016 cycle and about as much support from his party as Biden got from his after the Democratic vote rapidly consolidated around him in 2020.

This is mostly a measure of that consolidation, certainly. But it’s a reminder that even if Trump weren’t vacuuming up most Republican votes, that wouldn’t necessarily mean that they wouldn’t show up to vote for him in November as they did for him heavily in 2016. Perhaps those independents who came out for Haley in South Carolina won’t vote for Trump in November, but that does not mean that Biden will win the state. What’s more, part of the electorate in these contests — particularly New Hampshire, it’s safe to say — is made up of voters who are members of those groups eager to present the nomination as contested or an illustration of Trump’s weakness.

Advertisement

We might generally ask a related question: How often will Republican primary voters who aren’t simply trying to make Trump’s path forward difficult sit out November or vote for Biden? What’s more probable: that someone who prefers Haley to Trump politically will vote for Biden or that they’ll grumble and vote for Trump?

There are numerous case studies on this. Consider Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), one of the most vocal critics of Trump in the wake of 2020. He endorsed Trump over the weekend, framing November as a contest between Trump and Biden. Given that choice, he’s willing to hold his nose.

Just as these numbers don’t mean that Trump will necessarily lose in November, they also don’t mean he’ll win. A lot of Biden’s support is driven by hostility to Trump, as it was four years ago. The race remains uncertain and unsettled, with few solid precedents to consider.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Brian Kemp blamed on the immigration policies of President Joe Biden. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The killing of 22-year-old Laken Riley revived a theme — migrants committing violent crimes — that is animating the 2024 elections as Trump seeks a return to the White House. Trump famously launched his 2016 presidential bid with these words about Mexicans: “They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

The focus now is on migrants who have arrived in the country during the Biden administration, with Republicans blaming Biden for migrant flows even as Democrats attack Republicans for sinking proposed legislation that could have toughened border enforcement. That conflict is only likely to escalate this week with Biden and Trump planning dueling trips to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas on Thursday.

The man charged with murder in Riley’s beating death, Jose Ibarra, is a Venezuelan citizen who immigration authorities say unlawfully crossed into the U.S. in September 2022.

Riley was a nursing student at Augusta University’s Athens campus, after starting her college career at the much larger Athens campus of the University of Georgia. She was found dead Thursday after a roommate reported she didn’t return from a morning run in a wooded area of the University of Georgia campus near its intramural fields.

Hundreds of students and faculty members gathered Monday afternoon for a vigil for Riley organized by her sorority sisters at the University of Georgia campus. Many people cried and members of Alpha Chi Omega held carnations, a symbol of the sorority.

“Laken showed devotion with every aspect of her life,” said Chloe Mullis, president of the University of Georgia chapter of Alpha Chi Omega. “Doing things halfway just wasn’t an option. We lost one of the brightest lights that has ever been.”

Dabney Duncan, president of the University of Georgia Panhellenic Council, urged people to speak up about possible dangers to prevent further losses, referring to Georgia’s bulldog mascot. “We all carry that responsibility now to ensure that there is not one more dawg.”

Riley’s family planned a Friday visitation and Saturday funeral in Woodstock, Georgia, the suburb northwest of Atlanta where Riley graduated from high school.

U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement says Ibarra, 26, was detained by the Border Patrol on Sept. 8, 2022, after entering from Mexico near El Paso, Texas. He was released for further processing, according to ICE. It’s unclear if Ibarra applied for asylum.

According to ICE, Ibarra was arrested by New York police on Aug. 31 and charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation. Ibarra was released before ICE could ask New York officials to hold him until immigration authorities could take him into custody, ICE said. New York officials said Sunday they had no record of the arrest.

Trump on Monday repeated a pledge to deport migrants if reelected, adding in a post on social media that “Biden’s Border INVASION is destroying our country and killing our citizens!”

The White House expressed condolences to Riley’s family and referred questions about the case to ICE and local law enforcement.

On Thursday, Biden will travel to Brownsville, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley, an area that often sees large numbers of border crossings, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Trump will go to Eagle Pass, Texas, according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans.

Kemp told reporters after a breakfast speech on the university campus to the Athens Area Chamber of Commerce that “we just have a nightmare in this country with mass migration.”

“That is a failure of our system on multiple levels and at multiple times and it has resulted in a young woman’s death,” Kemp said during his speech. “That is inexcusable in any absence of any real effort by the Biden administration to step up and address this crisis, as they continue to ignore the calls for meaningful policy change that governors like me had made for well over two years.”

Georgia Democratic Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler called the Republican response to Riley’s death “appalling,” saying the GOP is to blame for scuttling a bill in Congress that would have toughened immigration enforcement.

“Our border crisis continues because Donald Trump has convinced one party that the only thing that matters is putting Donald Trump first no matter the cost,” Butler said in a speech on the state Senate floor.

Advertisement

Another Democrat, state Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, said the characterization of migrants as “criminals and thugs” following Riley’s death was xenophobic. “As Georgia mourns the life of Laken Riley, we must not succumb to tribalism and bigotry,” she said.

Many studies have found immigrants are less drawn to violent crime than native-born citizens. One published by the National Academy of Sciences, based on Texas Department of Public Safety data from 2012 to 2018, reported native-born citizens were more than twice as likely to be arrested for violent crimes than people in the country illegally.

Kemp, who is the vice chair of the Republican Governors Association has been emphasizing immigration, saying earlier this month that he would send more Georgia National Guard soldiers to help Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s effort to control illegal crossings on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Kemp’s emphasis on immigration could help mobilize Republican voters in the South’s foremost swing state. That could aid Kemp if he has future ambitions, such as running for U.S. Senate or president. It would also effectively support Trump even though Kemp continues to be cool toward Trump’s renomination after Trump tried and failed to derail Kemp’s 2022 reelection.

After the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to abortion restrictions, the party has struggled mightily with the new paradigm. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight And few examples drive that home like the party’s embrace of in vitro fertilization (IVF) late last week.

Suddenly, Republicans are making a point to emphasize that they support something their own very recent proposals could clearly have imperiled.

To recap: The Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people, and thus someone could be held liable in a lawsuit for discarding one. This led several of the state’s largest IVF facilities to pause the creation of new embryos out of fear of legal action.

A flood of Republicans, including former president Donald Trump on Friday, asserted that they support IVF. They were spurred by an extraordinary memo from Senate Republicans’ campaign arm urging everyone to embrace the fertility treatment.

Advertisement

Democrats countered by noting that many who expressed support for IVF have also supported the Life at Conception Act. The legislation, which Republicans have introduced in Congress for years, is sponsored by 125 House Republicans this Congress and was sponsored by 167 House Republicans last Congress.

The text of the act is relatively brief. But it builds on so-called “personhood” efforts and would effectively codify embryos as people — affording them the same protections under the 14th Amendment.

“The terms ‘human person’ and ‘human being’ include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being,” the bill says. It has never been acted upon by Congress.

Advertisement

The reason this bill could ensnare IVF — and the Alabama Supreme Court ruling did — is that the process often creates a number of embryos that aren’t immediately implanted. Those frozen embryos can be used at a later date, but they can also go unused.

The Washington Post’s Ariana Eunjung Cha and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux reported in 2022 about how the fall of Roe imperiled IVF:

One often misunderstood aspect is the number of fertilized eggs, or embryos, that will never grow into babies and are discarded. A couple might find, for instance, that among 10 embryos, most carry a mix of normal and abnormal cells, or have abnormal cells with an infinitesimally low probability of implanting in the uterus. Even fertilized eggs that test as “normal” often do not result in pregnancies.

As The Post’s Mariana Alfaro reports, Republicans who co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act but now insist they support IVF, like House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), haven’t addressed how they square those two positions.

As for how at odds they are?

Some on the right have suggested that this is much ado about nothing — that personhood efforts and the Life at Conception Act are obviously intended to restrict abortion, and that Republicans obviously support protecting IVF. As far back as 2013, a Pew Research Center poll found that just 12 percent of Americans — including 12 percent of Republican-leaning Americans — said that IVF is “morally wrong.”

But that poll question didn’t get into the complex issue of discarding embryos. Indeed, distilling the issue down to pro-IVF versus anti-IVF is to ignore those complex issues. And if you believe that an embryo should have the rights of a person, a logical question follows as to whether destroying or discarding one amounts to murder or wrongful death.

At the very least, it opens the door to significantly curtailing the use of IVF to prevent the discarding of any embryos or their accidental destruction — the latter being the situation the Alabama Supreme Court was deciding.

All of which is why at least some Republicans pursuing some such efforts have explicitly sought to exempt IVF:

A big question is why the House version of the bill doesn’t include such an exemption. Certainly, some involved might regard destroying embryos in any setting as being wrong. They might regard the language as being somehow unnecessary.

Or perhaps this bill has been more about messaging than a serious legislative effort.

As recently as last year, Julianna Goodman wrote a prescient couple of paragraphs in a perspective piece for The Post:

Some lawmakers who back personhood measures may not realize the full implications of the proposals, says Kaylen Silverberg, a reproductive endocrinologist and the medical director at Texas Fertility Center in Austin. … During a recent trip to D.C., he spoke with “one of the most conservative members of Congress” who was considering promoting a personhood statute. Silverberg depicted a scenario where an embryologist accidentally drops a dish of embryos and destroys its contents. “Is my embryologist going to be charged with murder, manslaughter?’” he asked the lawmaker, who in turn was “flabbergasted” because he hadn’t realized the measure’s full implications.

The circumstance closely mirrors what the Alabama Supreme Court ruled on.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) conceded Sunday on CNN, “I’m not sure everybody has really thought about what all the potential problems are, and as a result no one really knows what the potential answers are.”

But even that most innocuous explanation gets at the dilemma for the GOP. It’s one thing to oppose abortion in theory; it’s another to legislate it. That newfound ability to make good on their promises has led to immense difficulties, both morally and politically, given that much of their party wants to go in a direction a huge majority of Americans are not comfortable with.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Former president Donald Trump continued to undermine the alliance — and scare allies — by saying he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO allies who don’t pay enough. And a Republican U.S. senator is blaming the United States and NATO for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Still, the path for NATO to expand yet again cleared Monday, with the final holdout country endorsing Sweden’s ascension. That holdout: Hungary, which is led by Trump (and Vladimir Putin) ally Viktor Orban. Sweden will join Finland, which became a NATO country last year and vastly expanded the Russia-NATO land border.

That split screen highlights both the uncertain domestic politics of NATO and its potential centrality in the years to come, in the face of a belligerent Putin.

So where does the American public stand?

For now, it remains in NATO’s corner — even as it’s clear that the continued attacks from Trump and his allies have had an impact on the political right.

First, the good news for the alliance:

Quinnipiac University poll last week showed that more than 8 in 10 Americans said NATO was important to U.S. security. A majority — 56 percent — said it was “very important.”

An Economist/YouGov poll showed that Americans had a favorable opinion of NATO, 53 percent to 22 percent. (The rest were undecided.)

Americans also generally support the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO:

The YouGov poll showed that Americans said it was a good idea rather than a bad one, 46-19. Even Republicans leaned in favor, 36-30.

Chicago Council for Global Affairs-Ipsos survey shared with The Washington Post showed that 69 percent of Americans favored Ukraine’s admission to NATO. That included 64 percent of Republicans.

But these surveys also get at the “but.”

While Americans as a whole are about as supportive of NATO as they were shortly after Russia’s invasion in early 2022, Republicans have moved away from the alliance. A significant chunk of them also align with Trump’s comments about encouraging Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that don’t meet spending targets.

Republican support for Ukraine joining NATO has moved from 50 percent in favor with 19 percent opposed in the YouGov polling in July to 36-30 today.

Similarly, the Quinnipiac poll showed that the percentage of Republicans who label NATO “very important” has dropped from 40 percent in April 2022 to 33 percent today. Nearly as many label it either “not so important” (17 percent) or “not at all important” (12 percent).

The Quinnipiac poll also gave people a choice between pulling out of NATO because other countries don’t pay enough and staying in because NATO is so important to global security. Republicans aligned with the former sentiment more, 48-43, suggesting that an attempted NATO exit in Trump’s second term could have a base.

Perhaps the most striking numbers, though, have to do with Trump’s comments.

The Quinnipiac poll showed that Americans said Trump’s comments were a “bad idea,” 71-18. The YouGov poll showed that Americans disapproved, 54-23.

Advertisement

But in both cases, Republicans with an opinion were actually about evenly split: 38 percent called Trump’s comments a “good idea” (versus 39 percent saying “bad idea”), and 35 percent approved of his comments (versus 39 percent disapproving).

Even more notable was the split within the GOP. While Republicans who don’t identify as “MAGA” disapproved by a similar margin to Americans overall, 48-27, MAGA Republicans actually approved 46-29.

It also bears noting that, while Trump’s comments were somewhat vague and suggestive of Russia attacking those countries, the YouGov question specifically tested whether people supported “encouraging Russia to take action” against those countries.

Nearly half of MAGA Republicans supported actually doing that.

Some of this is undoubtedly Trump loyalists being told that Trump said something and deciding to align with him; the poll showed only about one-quarter of Republicans said they had heard “a lot” about Trump’s comments. And perhaps some see strategic value in ploys like this increasing pressure on NATO allies to pay more — the ostensible purpose of Trump’s comments.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Choose your plan ArrowRight Four takeaways from the Supreme Court’s landmark social media arguments The Supreme Court on Monday weighed the fate of two landmark social media cases that could have massive implications for the future of the internet and speech online, as we reported.

The court heard oral arguments over a pair of state laws in Texas and Florida that would prohibit tech companies from removing certain content, which were passed in response to Republican allegations that digital platforms are stifling conservative viewpoints.

During roughly four hours of arguments, most justices seemed broadly skeptical that state governments have the power to set rules “for how social media platforms curate content” as my colleagues Ann E. Marimow and Cat Zakrzewski wrote.

Advertisement

They also offered hints about how they may handle the blockbuster cases.

Here are our four takeaways from the sessions:

Justices call state laws overly ‘broad’

At various points, the justices criticized the broad scope of the Texas and Florida laws and the wide array of companies and services that they could cover.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor early on lamented that the Florida law was “so unspecific” and “so, so broad, it’s covering almost everything.” She added that the internet’s “variety” is “infinite” and questioned whether the burden should be on the state to clarify its scope.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett expressed similar concern, saying Florida’s law was “very broad” to the point that in addition to covering “traditional” social media platforms, it could also cover ride-hailing apps like Uber, Google’s search engine and Amazon’s e-commerce site.

Advertisement

Sotomayor said the same of the Texas law, warning that “laws like this that are so broad” may “stifle speech just on their face.” The criticisms bode well for tech industry groups.

Justices float kicking cases back to lower courts

Several justices broached the possibility of kicking the cases back to lower courts, while either upholding or overturning temporary blocks against the laws in the meantime.

Justice Samuel Alito kicked things off by suggesting the high court could “vacate and remand” a lower-court ruling striking down key provisions in Florida’s law, punting it back to them.

That move could allow questions about which specific company moderation practices are being challenged to be “fleshed out,” Alito argued. He suggested this could be a way to tackle the fact that industry groups were filing a “facial challenge” — which argues that the law is unconstitutional on its face even before any enforcement, rather than in how it was applied in a specific instance.

Advertisement

Sotomayor said she initially had the same inclination as Alito — to vacate and remand — but hinted she may be inclined instead to uphold the injunction while remanding it.

Sotomayor said it was “clear” from the discussion that many potentially covered practices “are expressive” and that some likely covered companies shouldn’t be considered “common carriers.” The remarks signal that the court could send the decision back with instructions for lower courts to dig into those distinctions.

Conservative court tackles tech ‘censorship’ allegations

Republicans have long accused social media platforms of unfairly “censoring” conservative voices. Tech industry groups have often responded by noting that the First Amendment protects against the suppression of free speech by the government — not private companies.

Advertisement

That back-and-forth got a major airing Monday as some conservative justices pushed back on the notion that the term could apply to platforms’ moderation practices.

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said at one point that Florida Solicitor General Henry Whitaker “left out what I understand to be three key words in the First Amendment” and its protection against speech suppression, namely, “by the government.” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. later echoed the remarks, saying, “The First Amendment restricts what the government can do.”

But other conservative at-times eschewed the distinction, with Alito asking if the term “content moderation” is “anything more than a euphemism for censorship?” Justice Clarence Thomas separately remarked: “I don't know of any protected speech interests in censoring other speech.” The comments suggest justices may not be aligned in their views on the matter.

Justices, states debate where to draw lines on the internet

The justices discussed ways to potentially distinguish between protected “speech” and business “conduct” by the tech companies that could be subject to the laws. However, it was not clear whether there’s consensus on the matter — or if it's an issue they’ll directly take up.

Advertisement

Justice Elena Kagan at one point asked whether a law could prohibit viewpoint discrimination in instances where you did not have to factor in questions about companies’ rights to “editorial discretion,” citing Venmo, Uber, Dropbox and Gmail as examples.

“When you're running Venmo, you're not engaged in speech activities,” she said, suggesting the company’s activity is distinct from the likes of Facebook and YouTube, which curate news feeds. Paul Clement, the counsel representing tech trade groups NetChoice and CCIA, pushed back. “All of those things are still in the expressive business,” he said.

The justices also debated if and how the laws would apply to a business like e-commerce site Etsy. “Etsy is a supermarket that wants to sell only vintage clothes, and so it is going to, and does, limit users' content,” Kagan said. “They're going to have to censor.”

Developers protest Apple's blocking of web apps in Europe

A group of open internet advocates and web developers are protesting Apple’s decision to stop allowing web apps in the European Union by writing an open letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, my colleague Gerrit De Vynck reports for The Technology 202.

Advertisement

Unlike regular apps, which are downloaded through the App Store, web apps are essentially an icon linking out to a web page on the internet. They're easier to make and take up less space on devices.

But Apple says it’s blocking them as part of its response to the EU's new laws regulating digital markets.

The web developers say Apple's reasons are “at best unfounded.” It's just one part of a giant fight over the new law — called the Digital Markets Act — and how tech companies are responding to it.

ArrowRight Biden will travel to Brownsville, Tex., on Thursday to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents, law enforcement personnel and local leaders, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal travel plans that were not publicly announced.

Last week news outlets reported Trump had planned to visit Eagle Pass, Tex., about 300 miles northwest of Brownsville. After Biden’s travel plans were reported on Monday, a spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign said Biden was belatedly trying to address the potent issue. Biden “has had three years to visit the border and fix the crisis he created,” Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for Trump’s campaign, said in a statement. “Biden’s last-minute, insincere attempt to chase President Trump to the border won’t cut it,” she said.

The trip comes as House Republicans have resisted bipartisan legislation linking increased spending to secure the border with foreign aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. The trip also comes as Republicans have made border security a key focus of their campaigns heading into the 2024 elections.

According to the White House official, Biden will use the trip to reiterate his call for Republicans in Congress to pass the bipartisan legislation, which will include a boost in funding for more U.S. Border Patrol agents, asylum officers and technology to detect fentanyl being smuggled over the border.

Support for building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico now has support from a majority of adults in the country, according to a new poll published Monday by Monmouth University. The poll of about 900 adults showed 53 percent of adults said they support building a wall, compared with 46 who opposed it. That support includes 86 percent of Republicans, 58 percent of independents and just 17 percent of Democrats.

Previously, the highest level of support that initiative received was 46 percent back in April 2019, according to Monmouth University.

The latest poll also showed that concerns about illegal immigration have also risen.

The government then said this week that Smirnov has “extensive foreign ties, including, most troublingly and by his own account, contact with foreign intelligence services, including Russian intelligence agencies, and has had such contacts recently.”

The news comes seven months after the indictment of another GOP source was unsealed. Republicans had conspiratorially suggested that a key witness who claimed to have damaging information about Hunter Biden had mysteriously gone missing. It turned out the witness was Gal Luft, who the government said had skipped bail after his indictment for alleged arms trafficking and foreign lobbying violations was handed down months earlier.

Days before the indictment was unsealed, House GOP impeachment leader Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) called Luft a “a very credible witness on Biden family corruption.” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said shortly before the unsealing that Luft had a “wealth of information” about the Bidens.

Smirnov and Luft are hardly the only ones who have faced criminal charges or other penalties — or whose credibility could otherwise be called into question.

Republicans in their impeachment push have hailed — and spun — the testimony of Hunter Biden’s former business partner, Devon Archer. Archer was sentenced in 2022 to a year in prison for defrauding a Native American tribe.

They have repeatedly referenced former Ukraine prosecutor general Viktor Shokin’s dubious claim that then-Vice President Biden had sought Shokin’s firing to protect the Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden, Burisma. (Now-House Speaker Mike Johnson [R-La.] even said last year that Shokin’s Fox News interview should be “the headline in every news outlet in America.”)

In fact, the evidence suggests Shokin was not really scrutinizing Burisma. And Shokin was widely decried by the West as being soft on corruption.

The Shokin allegation dates back to the earliest GOP efforts to dig up dirt on Biden during the 2020 election. Several figures who worked with then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani have since been accused of ties to Russia, interfering in the 2020 election and/or crimes.

A sampling:

Some of the above situations echoed the Trump campaign’s flirtations with Russian help in the 2016 election.

A bipartisan 2020 Senate Intelligence Committee report cited 2016 Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s sharing of information with Vladimir Putin-linked oligarch Oleg Deripaska and Konstantin Kilimnik, whom it described as a “Russian intelligence officer.” It said the arrangement “represented a grave counterintelligence threat.”

Kilimnik was indicted alongside Manafort in 2018. Deripaska was sanctioned by Trump’s Treasury Department in 2018 and indicted in 2022.

Rooting out corruption sometimes involves dealing with unsavory characters. Some of the legal actions against Trump, for instance, have leaned on the testimony of his convicted former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight But many of the same Republicans who are saying Americans should have access to IVF have co-sponsored legislation that employs an argument similar to the one the Alabama Supreme Court used in its ruling.

The congressional proposal, known as the Life at Conception Act, defines a “human being” to “include each member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization or cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being.” The bill would also provide equal protection under the 14th Amendment “for the right to life of each born and preborn human person.”

The measure has no provisions for processes like IVF, meaning access to the procedure would not be protected. It would ban nearly all abortions nationwide.

The legislation is co-sponsored by 125 Republicans in the House, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who, in the wake of the Alabama ruling, said in a statement to The Washington Post that he supports efforts to allow IVF treatments because he believes “the life of every single child has inestimable dignity and value.”

A spokesman for Johnson did not comment on the speaker’s support for the Life at Conception Act, or on whether the speaker would support a congressional effort to protect IVF procedures federally.

In November, Johnson told Fox News that he does not oppose access to fertility treatments.

“That’s something that’s blessed a lot of families who have problems with fertility,” he said. “Of course that’s a great thing. I would support that.”

The Alabama court’s ruling has already worried would-be parents as several of the state’s biggest IVF clinics have paused the creation of embryos out of fear of liability. Several lawmakers in the state are now scrambling to introduce bills that would allow for IVF.

On Sunday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) — who conceived her two children with the help of IVF and who has been a vocal proponent of reproductive rights — noted that “not a single Republican” has spoken to her about a bill she has introduced that would establish a federal right to access IVF and other assisted reproductive technology services nationwide.

“It’s been crickets since the Alabama ruling,” Duckworth told ABC News’s “This Week.” “Let’s make it clear: Republicans will say whatever they need to say to try to cover themselves on this.”

Duckworth then challenged Republicans in Congress to pass a measure to protect IVF.

“Let’s see if they vote for it when we bring it to the floor,” she said.

The Life at Conception Act — the measure that would not protect IVF access — was reintroduced to Congress in January 2023 but it has not successfully been turned into law. No committee has held a hearing on it.

It is not the first time Republicans have introduced the bill. In 2021, it was co-sponsored by 167 Republicans, including Reps. Nancy Mace (S.C.) and Byron Donalds (Fla.), who are now voicing their support for IVF procedures. Mace and Donalds are not co-sponsors of the reintroduced effort.

Mace, in a post shared on X on Saturday, said she would “stop any and all efforts to ban IVF.” She, however, made no mention of her previous support for the Life at Conception Act. A spokeswoman for Mace did not respond to a request for comment.

Donalds — a far-right Republican who has been named in shortlists for former president Donald Trump’s potential vice-presidential picks — said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that he supports IVF because he has “several friends” who went through the procedure, which allowed them to have children. “[IVF] is something that is so critical to a lot of couples. It helps them breed great families,” he said.

“I totally support the procedure,” Donalds said. “We really want the Alabama legislature to make sure that that procedure is protected for families who do struggle with having children, that helps them actually create great families, which is what our country desperately needs.”

When asked if he would support a congressional effort to protect IVF procedures at the federal level, Donalds said he would “broadly support that.” He did not refer to his previous support for Life at Conception Act. A spokesman for Donalds did not respond to a request for comment on Donalds’s position change.

The House members’ vocal support for IVF procedures comes after Trump and Republican candidates in key Senate races sought distance between themselves and the Alabama ruling. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, a group tasked with electing Republicans to the Senate, urged its candidates on the ballot this year to support IVF and reject government restrictions, citing the procedure’s popularity.

Democrats have signaled that they plan to leverage the ruling in the 2024 elections. The White House and the Biden reelection campaign have placed the blame on Trump and the Supreme Court’s decision. And the IVF issue is already becoming fodder for campaigns and fundraising groups.

While Democrats have particularly focused on shifts in policy over IVF from Senate Republicans and Republican candidates, Johnson’s statement also drew attention from Democratic operatives. In a statement Saturday, Democratic National Committee spokesman Alex Floyd said Johnson “can’t run from the reality that he spent his entire career trying to outlaw basic access to reproductive health care.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

But President Biden’s latest embrace of strict policies to contain the influx of migrants coming to the U.S. southern border has left him disappointed.

Sitting here at a downtown beer garden, Villafan and several other members of the Maricopa County Young Democrats unloaded their frustration over how they feel Biden — and Washington in general — has failed to tackle immigration, an issue that is front-of-mind and personal for many living in this border state.

“It’s not just Republicans. Democrats, too, like to push the narrative that we’re being invaded — and as a registered Democrat, it’s really hurtful to see because my parents came here wanting to seek a better life,” Villafan, 23, said just a three-hour drive north from Arizona’s shared border with Mexico.

But across the table, Sam Dent, 32, an independent who was among the swing voters who voted for Biden in 2020 and helped deliver the battleground state, has long worried about repeated failures by Democrats and Republicans to pass a compromise that tackles the major influx of migrants crossing the border — including a bipartisan proposal this month that Republicans shot down.

Dent looked down at his phone to fact-check to confirm the historic number of migrant crossings, before saying: “Border security is a problem. Immigration policy in America is a problem. I honestly think it’s a real problem.”

Interviews with dozens of Democratic and independent voters here — the kind of younger voters Biden will need to win over in a potential rematch against former president Donald Trump — reveal a deep frustration with the president for recently embracing tougher rhetoric and policies against illegal immigration while delivering what they view as little concrete action to improve the immigration system. Many voters said it felt unclear what message, if any, Biden or the party had on the issue — and most said Biden’s handling of immigration further reinforces their lack of enthusiasm about a potential second Biden term.

Immigration has long been a fraught issue for both parties, especially in election years. Republicans have slammed Biden on his handling of the high numbers of migrant crossings since the start of the administration and have ramped up attacks in recent months. The issue has also become increasingly divisive for the Democratic Party as the president tries to prove he has been an effective leader capable of addressing acute challenges, such as the fallout from large numbers of migrants coming that has overwhelmed cities across the country.

Many voters interviewed here had differing views on the severity of the situation at the U.S. border and the concrete solutions Biden could pursue — but, they all said, they don’t trust either party to do anything other than talk it up in an election year. Here, where immigration has topped the minds of Arizonans for decades, younger voters said they’ve grown up disillusioned and distrustful after empty promises from politicians across the political spectrum.

Caleb Campbell, an independent and lead pastor at Desert Springs Bible Church, an evangelical church, has been particularly impassioned on immigration policy for years as multiple members of his church are undocumented or recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that allows undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to live and work in the country without fear of deportation. Under both Trump and Biden, he’s seen both leaders and their parties fail to act, which he says “has been infuriating.” He expressed frustration that so much of the debate on immigration these days is focused on the border.

“I’m pissed off that the people who should be and know better and who should be enacting legislation to alleviate these problems are shrugging off the responsibilities for political gain,” Campbell, 42, said shortly after a recent Sunday service. “It’s unrighteous, it’s unjust and you see them doing this for political gain on both sides.”

“Disappointment is not a strong enough word,” he added.

Among these voters, both left-leaning and moderates, few could identify a specific Biden administration action that has improved the immigration system. Several said they feel Biden has been largely silent on the issue and is now adopting conservative talking points that focus on securing the border. They worry his shift in rhetoric is because Republicans are winning in their messaging on the issue — not because he actually cares about addressing the challenges at the border.

For some, it’s a betrayal after they’d been hopeful Biden would overhaul the immigration system as he had promised on the campaign trail.

“I don’t like that Biden caved into the Republican Party,” Villafan said, though he plans to support Biden, praising the president’s policies for working class and union families, and is urging his co-workers and friends to vote for him in the battleground state where Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020.

But his friend, Anna Abeytia, 28, said Biden “hasn’t done anything, especially with immigration, to make me want to support him.”

“I don’t feel like voting for him or not voting for him is gonna change anything here in Arizona,” said Abeytia, a part-time student and board member of the Cartwright Elementary School District.

In his early days in office in 2021, Biden was quick to take executive actions as he sought to undo controversial Trump-era policies, such as lifting the bans on travel to the United States from several Muslim-majority countries and suspending enrollment in the “Remain in Mexico” program that required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico to await their immigration proceedings in U.S. courts. On his first day as president, Biden also sent Congress an immigration bill that included a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.

For three years, Biden has been faced with an unprecedented number of migrant crossings overwhelming border agents. Facing pressure from within his party, Biden recently embraced a bipartisan border bill that would have included significant funding for ICE enforcement at the border, a higher standard for migrants seeking asylum to meet and a mechanism to effectively close the border to most migrants when crossings are particularly high. The bill was endorsed by the staunchly conservative union for Border Patrol officers and slammed by many immigrant and human rights groups. Amnesty International USA said it contained “the most extreme anti-immigrant proposals this country has seen in 100 years.”

The bill quickly failed, after Trump — who openly said he did not want to give Biden a political win — pressured Senate Republicans to reject it.

While many voters said they felt Biden has largely ignored immigration, his administration has taken more than 530 immigration-related executive actions in his first three years in office, outnumbering the 472 undertaken by Trump in his full term, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

But there are limits to what Biden can accomplish through executive orders. Biden has faced several court challenges on his immigration-related executive actions, which has stalled or curbed some of his administration’s efforts, and Congress has failed to pass any meaningful immigration reform in decades.

According to a survey from Pew Research Center released this month, 73 percent of Democrats say the United States is doing a bad job of dealing with the large number of migrants seeking to enter the country — the highest share recorded during Biden’s presidency. In October, a New York Times-Siena College survey found that, among registered voters in Arizona, 54 percent trusted Trump more on immigration while 41 percent trusted Biden.

Democratic and independent voters said the current handling of immigration policy only reinforced their negative outlook on the future of the country.

Among a group of members of Young Democrats at Arizona State University in Tempe, students expressed their dismay about how Biden has tackled immigration.

“To me, it just doesn’t feel like there’s a difference in like Trump or Biden when it comes to immigration because the same thing is happening,” said Gillian McSheffrey, 20, a sophomore at ASU, on a recent Friday afternoon. “It’s kind of embarrassing to be a Democrat sometimes because it feels like no one really cares, in either party, about the issue.”

Sitting in a classroom on campus, McSheffrey and her fellow Democrats cited example after example of how they felt Biden had disappointed them on immigration. They mentioned Biden’s support of the bipartisan bill, which included no pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. They pointed to Biden’s plan to build new barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. They criticized Biden for embracing foreign policy for decades that they feel has contributed to destabilizing the very countries where many migrants hail from.

“It feels so heartless,” McSheffrey added.

Agustín Torres, 21, a junior at ASU, nodded in agreement.

“I do think there’s a crisis though on the border. There are a lot of people coming over and that really makes me nervous,” Torres said.

Torres’ family crossed the border illegally more than 100 years ago, he said, so he felt confident that immigrants coming today could assimilate and contribute to the United States if the immigration system were better organized to accept them.

On Biden, Torres said he’s not sure if he can support the president in November, calling him an “extraordinarily weak candidate,” who “hasn’t really delivered on what he said.” On immigration, he said Biden has done a “very poor job.” But he said members of Congress also carry a lot of the blame for their “unwillingness to act.”

“It’s exhausting,” said Gem Wolf-Schwaiger, 19, who uses they and them pronouns. “So many empty words when there should be more done.”

Wolf-Schwaiger said they could understand people in the United States being alarmed by so many migrants entering the country, but they felt politicians needed to stoke less fear and just do more — like better fund the immigration court system and create more legal pathways to come to the United States.

But given the attacks from Republicans on transgender and queer rights, Wolf-Schwaiger said they felt they had to vote for Biden.

“I wish I felt like I had another option,” Wolf-Schwaiger said as their service dog Echo, sporting a blue Young Dems shirt, lay beside them.

McSheffrey said she will vote for Biden come November, but she isn’t excited about it. It’ll be her first time voting in a presidential election.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The 25-year-old airman, Aaron Bushnell, of San Antonio, Texas, died from his injuries, the Metropolitan Police Department said Monday.

Bushnell had walked up to the embassy shortly before 1 p.m. Sunday and began livestreaming on the video streaming platform Twitch, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Law enforcement officials believe he set his phone down and then doused himself in accelerant and ignited the flames. At one point, he said he “will no longer be complicit in genocide,” the person said. The video was later removed from the platform, but law enforcement officials have obtained and reviewed a copy.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Investigators believe Bushnell had been staying at a Travelodge in Silver Spring, Maryland, which was searched Monday by federal agents, a law enforcement official said. That official was not authorized to disclose details of the investigation publicly and also spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

In a statement Monday, the Air Force said, “The individual involved in yesterday’s incident succumbed to his injuries and passed away last night.”

Later Monday, the Air Force said Bushnell was a cyber defense operations specialist with the 531st Intelligence Support Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio. He had served on active duty since May 2020.

Col. Celina Noyes, commander the 70th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing, said: “When a tragedy like this occurs, every member of the Air Force feels it. We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Senior Airman Bushnell.”

Demonstrators held a vigil for Bushnell outside the Israeli embassy Monday night.

The incident happened as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking the cabinet approval for a military operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah while a temporary cease-fire deal is being negotiated. Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, however, has drawn criticisms, including genocide claims against the Palestinians.

Israel has adamantly denied the genocide allegations and says it is carrying out operations in accordance with international law in the Israel-Hamas war.

In December, a person self-immolated outside the Israeli consulate in Atlanta and used gasoline as an accelerant, according to Atlanta’s fire authorities. A Palestinian flag was found at the scene, and the act was believed to be one of “extreme political protest.”

It paints a picture of a base that’s more homogenous than the one that backed him as the GOP nominee eight years ago. Trump’s increasingly extreme positions and rhetoric have clearly alienated more moderate voting blocs while attracting voters from the party’s right flank and allowing him to maintain support in other key groups.

While none of that has hindered Trump in the primaries — he won the first three by double digits — it could create liabilities for him in the general election. It could also speak to some advantages he has over President Biden. Here’s a look at how Trump’s base has changed.

Trump’s base is older

One of the most pronounced shifts is in the age of Trump’s base. Voters 65 and over made up a minority of his base in 2016. This year, they’re the largest group in terms of age.

Young Republicans have turned from him. Voters under 50 accounted for 37 percent of his base at this point in the 2016 campaign; now, they make up less than 29 percent. His share of middle-aged voters is also down, falling from nearly 40 percent to about 35 percent.

Older Americans vote at higher levels than other age groups, so Trump benefits by performing well with them. But he’ll struggle to defeat President Biden in November without peeling off some younger voters, who played an outsize role in Biden’s 2020 victory.

Trump’s voters are really conservative

Also apparent in primary exit polling is Trump’s reshaping of the Republican Party. As the GOP has lurched to the right, so has his base. More than 52 percent of his voters so far described themselves as “very conservative,” up from about 32 percent during his first run.

The share of his voters describing themselves as “somewhat conservative” fell from 46 percent to 38 percent. Less than 10 percent of Trump voters described themselves as “moderate,” down from more than 20 percent.

It’s unclear whether this trend will serve Trump in the general election. Nationwide, more Americans identify as conservative on social issues and economic issues than at any point since 2012, according to polling from Gallup last year. But Republicans accounted for the bulk of that shift, with independents moving only somewhat to the right.

There’s also evidence that swing voters are turned off by hard-right candidates, many of whom lost close contests in the 2022 midterms. Independents may be fed up with Biden, but they also may be wary of a GOP they view as too radical.

Women have stuck with Trump

The overturning of Roe v. Wade and the ending of the constitutional right to an abortion has already cost the Republican Party. But in the early primaries, it doesn’t appear to have hurt Trump’s standing among Republican women, who made up a slightly larger share of his base than eight years ago.

He still performed far better among men, who accounted for 54 percent of his supporters in the first three states. But predictions about Republican women fleeing to other candidates after the Supreme Court’s landmark Dobbs decision haven’t borne out so far.

Outside the party, it’s a different story. Recent polling shows female registered voters support Biden by a more than 20-point margin, up from just two months ago. Trump will need more than just Republican women to close that gap.

Evangelical Republicans have flocked to Trump

By and large, White evangelical Christians liked Trump in 2016. But at the time many put their faith in Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), whose religious bona fides were well known. Powered by those voters, Cruz managed to snatch the Iowa caucuses from Trump before fading in the polls.

This year, Trump has a lock on the Christian right. Evangelicals made up a majority of his base — almost 51 percent — up from about 48 percent during his first run.

Evangelicals tend to be more politically engaged than other groups, but they’re a relatively small portion of voters overall. So while their support helps Trump in the primaries, it won’t necessarily mean a windfall for him in the general.

Suburban voters haven’t left Trump

Trump’s support in the suburbs in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina was the same as it was in 2016. But, of course, those states are relatively rural compared with the rest of the country, so his performance there may not be the strongest indicator for how he’ll fare in more densely populated states.

Still, suburbs are a key focus for both parties because they’re a critical battleground nationally. Biden beat Trump in the suburbs in the 2020 election, so Trump will be looking to make inroads there.

correction A previous version of this article incorrectly said voters under 40 accounted for 37 percent of Trump's base at this point in the 2016 campaign and now make up less than 29 percent. It is voters under 50. This article has been corrected.

About this story The South Carolina and New Hampshire exit polls results are from a survey of Republican primary voters as they exited randomly selected voting sites in South Carolina (2,126 voters on Feb. 24, 2024) and New Hampshire (2,129 voters on Jan. 23, 2024). Iowa results are from interviews of 1,628 caucus-goers as they entered randomly selected caucus locations across Iowa on Jan. 15, 2024. The polls were conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC), The Washington Post and other media organizations. Results were weighted to match vote tallies by region and to correct for differential participation by subgroup.

She lost by double digits in New Hampshire. In Nevada — where Donald Trump’s name wasn’t on the primary ballot — Nikki Haley trailed “none of these candidates” by more than 30 points. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Haley has now suffered another blow in the lopsided race for the Republican presidential nomination, losing to Trump by about 20 points in her home state of South Carolina. Yet she promised to press on.

“In the next 10 days, another 21 states and territories will speak,” Haley said Saturday night. “They have the right to a real choice, not a Soviet-style election with only one candidate. And I have a duty to give them that choice.”

As the last Republican candidate standing against Trump, Haley has drawn polarized reactions as she has become a vehicle for the deep discontent that some in the party feel about a Trump rematch with President Biden. More a symbolic reservoir for that sentiment than an obstacle on Trump’s path to the nomination, Haley has positioned herself as the leader of a vocal minority, saying Saturday that her roughly 40 percent showing “is not some tiny group,” but a sign that “huge numbers of voters in our Republican primaries” still want a Trump alternative.

Her decision to push forward, at least through Super Tuesday on March 5, has antagonized Trump and his allies and baffled plenty of political observers, who point out that there is little evidence she has a path to victory in a single state, let alone the primary as a whole. Her latest loss in South Carolina — where Haley served as governor for six years — ramps up the pressure on her to get out in the name of party unity, especially as she escalates her criticism of Trump. An official with the conservative political network led by billionaire Charles Koch, which sought to defeat Trump in the primary, announced Sunday that the network would not put any more money behind Haley and would focus instead on down-ballot races.

Yet even as the indignities of the primary season pile up for Haley, some supporters are happy to see her continue as the voice of the old-guard conservative wing of the GOP that Trump has cast aside and done little to court or placate as he moves into general-election mode.

“Those of us from the Reagan wing of the party want her to stay in because we want to remind people we are still here,” said Eric Levine, a Haley donor. “We’re not winning without the Reagan wing of the party, and Nikki Haley represents that wing.”

Further head-to-head contests between Haley and Trump are likely to underscore how thoroughly the former president has reshaped the party and overpowered its traditionalists. Polls in numerous Super Tuesday states show Trump well ahead, and Trump’s team expects him to clinch the nomination by mid-March.

“She’s kind of showing how weak that wing of the party is,” GOP strategist Bob Heckman said of the camp behind Haley.

Yet Haley’s coalition includes precisely the kind of moderate and independent voters whom the Republican Party will be fighting for in November. “The very voters who support Nikki are the ones that Trump needs in the general election,” said Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire GOP party chairman who identifies as a “Never Trump” Republican.

Haley is allowing them to express their reservations, he argued, in the same way that Democrat Jerry Brown was a vehicle for expressing reservations about Bill Clinton in 1992.

“It’s Trump’s failure to make those people comfortable with him. … That’s his problem and that’s his responsibility,” Cullen said.

Haley’s allies acknowledge she faces tough odds but see her fight as important. “There are other reasons to run than winning,” said an official with SFA Fund, the pro-Haley super PAC, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the race more candidly. The official said Haley’s campaign had become more of a “crusade.”

Trump focused on the general election in his victory speech Saturday night in South Carolina. “I just want to say that I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now,” he said to cheers, noting the many Republican officials standing behind him.

Prominent Republicans, even some who are critical of Trump, have rallied behind the former president as his renomination appears inevitable. Trump was visibly angry at Haley last month after she promised to keep campaigning past New Hampshire, and even threatened that anyone who donated to her further would be “permanently barred” from his camp.

Haley treaded carefully around Trump for most of her campaign, telling voters that she would be more electable and that “rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him.” She said she would support Trump as the GOP nominee even if he was convicted in his pending criminal cases, and at one point she ducked questions about whether she would serve as his vice president, feeding speculation that she wanted to keep that path open.

As the field cleared and Trump turned his fire on Haley, however, she sharpened her case.

She questioned Trump’s mental fitness. She criticized Trump for saying he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO members he is unhappy with. She pushed back hard after Trump mocked her husband’s absence on the campaign trail. (He is serving a voluntary deployment in Djibouti with the South Carolina Army National Guard.) She rebuked Trump’s “America First” policies, saying recently that “it’s not ‘America First’ to bankrupt Social Security by doing nothing to fix it.”

“I feel no need to kiss the ring. I have no fear of Trump’s retribution,” she said in a speech recently, as many Republicans suggested that she was hurting her political career by extending her campaign against Trump and ramping up her criticism.

In that speech — meant to explain why she wasn’t dropping out — Haley cited polling showing that most Americans are unhappy with a Trump-Biden rematch. They deserve a voice, she said: “I’ll keep fighting until the American people close the door.”

Some Republicans see a practical value in Haley campaigning for as long as she can, on the outside chance that some dramatic event makes Trump unviable. “If something happens, she’s the one who can pick up the pieces,” said Levine. “It makes sense for her … to stay in, continue to gather delegates. She has the money to do it.”

Yet it’s not clear that even a conviction in one of Trump’s trials would sideline him, because the cases have largely served to motivate Republicans.

Some Republicans are especially eager to move on fully from the primary because Trump and his allies trail Biden in fundraising. Haley and her allies have continued to raise money at a pace that has given her some runway, they say — a point of frustration for some Trump supporters.

“It’s time to rally around the eventual nominee,” said Dan Eberhart, a GOP donor who backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president but then endorsed Trump after DeSantis dropped out.

Tom Davis, a South Carolina state legislator who endorsed Haley, argued that it’s “healthy” for Haley to drive a broader discussion about the Republican Party as some reel at its transformation under Trump and support the conservatism that Haley has championed, such as U.S. engagement abroad.

“Haley is the last person standing against Donald Trump in this primary having that larger conversation about what kind of a party do we want to be,” Davis said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Kennedy Jr. would not say when he thinks life begins. In an interview with The Washington Post, Kennedy said the Alabama decision on in vitro fertilization — which has caused some IVF clinics to pause services in the state — was a mistake “to the extent that it limited access to” the fertility procedure. He said he had not read the decision, although he later reviewed it and said he “wholeheartedly” rejects the ruling.

Kennedy did not say whether he would protect abortion access, arguing that while he believes women should “have the right to choose,” he thinks “there is a limitation on what the Constitution says.”

Asked what he would do to protect abortion access and reproductive rights if he were elected president, Kennedy said: “I don’t know, you tell me. What should I be doing?”

Kennedy, who left the Democratic Party his family once led to run as an independent, has struggled to outline a clear policy plan on abortion access and reproductive rights — an issue that has catapulted to the center of the 2024 election season.

At a time when Democrats have sought to galvanize their base around protecting reproductive rights, Kennedy’s answer reflects a difficulty he could face in appealing to his former party’s voters. Meanwhile, Republicans have scrambled to find unity over the issue that drove voters to opt for Democrats in the midterms and in more recent elections.

After this story published Sunday, Kennedy further clarified his opinion on the ruling. His spokeswoman said he has read the decision since the interview, but she would not elaborate on whether he disagreed with the court’s decision that embryos are people.

“Most Republicans I speak to are sick of this political theater,” he wrote on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. “Let’s get back to working for the needs of the American people.”

Kennedy has previously changed his stance or walked back his positions when asked about a federal abortion ban. In an interview with NBC News at the Iowa State Fair in August, Kennedy said that he believes “a decision to abort a child should be up to the women during the first three months of life” and that he would support an abortion ban at 15 or 21 weeks. His campaign later clarified that he “misunderstood” the question in the noisy space and that Kennedy “does not support legislation banning abortion.” In a town hall last June, he said he thinks women have a choice for the “first three months of pregnancy.” On Saturday, Kennedy told The Post: “Every abortion ultimately is a tragedy.”

Kennedy, speaking at the California Libertarian convention this weekend, also emphasized his belief in “medical autonomy” when asked about the Alabama decision, adding that he doesn’t think “the government should be making choices about medical treatments for Americans” or “for what people do with their bodies.” He has continued to campaign on doubting the safety and efficacy of the coronavirus vaccine and on arguing against vaccinate mandates.

That message, which has not resonated with Democrats, found appeal among libertarians at the convention. Kennedy and other third-party presidential candidates spoke to the delegates gathered this weekend to try to appeal to the party, which has garnered greater ballot access.

Kennedy said he had not ruled out the possibility of running for the Libertarian Party nomination, telling The Post, “We’re looking at every option.” Yet, few at the convention expressed any interest in him becoming the nominee.

Ahead of the party formally choosing its nominee at a national convention in May, the California Libertarian delegates voted via straw poll for their preference, largely rejecting Kennedy. Out of 95 delegates who voted, one person chose Kennedy.

Most of the delegates’ votes were split between the Libertarian candidates, indicating that delegates might seek a candidate who better aligns with the party’s platforms.

The question of Kennedy’s potential nomination comes as the party has struggled with its identity and infighting in recent years, as membership has declined. Some in the party have argued that Kennedy could offer the party national recognition, but others vocally opposed what they see as a break from their principles.

“The Libertarian Party is extremely fractured right now,” said Christopher Thrasher, an independent ballot access consultant who has advised previous Libertarian presidential nominees and has since left the party.

Angela McArdle, the chair of the Libertarian National Committee, warned in a speech to the group Sunday that Kennedy’s independent candidacy might further threaten the party’s efforts, because he could pull voters from their nominee.

“Things have been rough over the last year in the Libertarian Party,” McArdle said.

The Kennedy campaign and the PAC supporting him, American Values 2024, have spent millions of dollars on getting his name on state ballots, and the Libertarian nomination could offer him an easier and less expensive path toward ballot access. Kennedy will be on the ballot in Utah, and the campaign says it has met the requirements for New Hampshire and Hawaii.

But Kennedy, a lawyer and environmental activist who has spent decades supporting Democrats, has also acknowledged his ideological differences with the Libertarian Party. He has faced criticism here over his support of Israel and for a $15 minimum wage.

“How can a supposed antiwar candidate promote that military funding and arming of the state of Israel in their genocidal campaign against the Palestine people?” Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Rectenwald said to the California delegates, a line that was met with applause.

Libertarian presidential candidate Jacob Hornberger said Kennedy could be “exploring renting” the party for ballot access, but it doesn’t make sense for Kennedy or the party to pair given their differences.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"
