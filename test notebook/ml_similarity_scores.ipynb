Lynne Sladky/AP/File\\n\\nThe morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial.\\n\\nArguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline.\\n\\nJudge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case.\\n\\nProsecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9.\\n\\nIn the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline.\\n\\nCannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case.\\n\\n## Documents Case ##|Live updates: Trump classified documents hearing, Fani Willis disqualification closing arguments|https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240223210059-donald-trump-february-23-2024-rock-hill-south-carolina-super-tease.jpg|https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-classified-documents-fani-willis-03-01-24/index.html|[]    |\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.\\n\\nTrump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.\\n\\n\"In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,\" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.\\n\\nOn Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a \"personal vendetta\" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, \"$464,576,230.62.\"\\n\\n\"+$114,553.04,\" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.\\n\\nTRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE\\n\\nAgain, on Feb. 25, James posted, \"+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.\"\\n\\nJames' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization.\\n\\nEngoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for \"persistent and repeated fraud,\" \"falsifying business records,\" \"issuing false financial statements,\" \"conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,\" \"insurance fraud,\" and \"conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\"\\n\\nThe former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.\\n\\nTrump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron \"committed errors of law and/or fact\" and whether he abused his discretion or \"acted in excess\" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.\\n\\nTRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR\\n\\nTrump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.\\n\\nThe Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.\\n\\nThere was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.\\n\\n\"We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,\" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.\\n\\nTrump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.\\n\\nJames, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTrump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was \"election interference\" and \"weaponization against a political opponent.\" Trump said he was being punished for \"having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.\"\\n\\nFox News' Anders Hagstrom and The Associated Press contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |NY AG taunts Trump about interest he owes on civil fraud judgment  Fox News                                             |\n",

You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. \"\\n\\n\"You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,\" he testified.\\n\\nThe first son said House Republicans \"have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by\" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov.\\n\\nJOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES\\n\\n\"Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,\" he said.\\n\\nHunter Biden, reflecting on \"mistakes\" he has made in his life, said he has \"squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.\"\\n\\n\"But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,\" he said.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SHARE HUNTER BIDEN'S CHINA-LINKED BANK RECORDS WITH US ATTORNEY LEADING CRIMINAL PROBE\\n\\nReflecting on his \"battle with addiction,\" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.\\n\\n\"He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,\" he testified. \"What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.\"\\n\\nHunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.\\n\\n\"Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,\" he said. \"Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.\"\\n\\nFLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE\\n\\nHe added: \"If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.\"\\n\\nThe first son said he hopes his testimony will \"put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.\"\\n\\n\"You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,\" he testified.\\n\\nHunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said \"there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,\" after his client's testimony.\\n\\n\"Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,\" Lowell said, adding: \"Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.\"\\n\\nHunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden \"has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest\" in his business ventures.\\n\\nHouse Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.\\n\\nDays before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.\\n\\nAfter Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to \"now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.\"\\n\\nHouse Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.\\n\\n\"The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,\" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. \"Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.\\n\\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry.

      "|Kamala Harris praises 'nonpartisan poll worker,' which immediately backfires when people learn who he is|Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired. \"Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,\" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman. Instead of applauding a \"nonpartisan\" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers \"might want to know,\" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement. \"The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,\" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet. KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as \"the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.\" \"In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,\" it continues. He is also credited with training \"thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context. One user described Harris’ tweet as \"like a major self-own\" and said it was \"just sad.\" HALEY SAYS US WILL HAVE 'FEMALE PRESIDENT' — EITHER HERSELF OR KAMALA HARRIS \"Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,\" the user added. \"If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.\" \"Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?\" another added. One user responded: \"Vasu Abhiraman (left) is quite partisan, actually.\" \"I really appreciate community notes!\" added another. And, \"Community Notes FTW [for the win].\"  On its website, the AFJ says its mission is to \"build the strength of progressive movements by training and educating nonprofit organizations on advocacy, harnessing their collective power to transform our state and federal courts.\"|Kamala Harris praises 'nonpartisan poll worker,' which immediately backfires when people learn who he is  Fox News|[Kamala, Harris, praises, 'nonpartisan, poll, worker, ,, ', which, immediately, backfires, when, people, learn, who, he, is]|\n",
      "|Marianne Williamson returns to presidential race, saying Biden is vulnerable against Trump              |Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign. Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump. \"As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,\" Williamson said. \"I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.\" \"Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?\" she asked. \"What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?\" DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN LAYOFFS, VOWS TO REMAIN IN RACE: 'REALLY TOUGH DAY' \"We're still in this. Let's do this.

DEAN PHILLIPS DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM CAMPAIGN OPERATIVE WHO REPORTEDLY PAID $1 FOR AI-GENERATED BIDEN DEEPFAKE Williamson first ran for president in 2019 – also against Biden and a slew of other Democrats – and announced in early 2023 that she would be challenging the president again in 2024.  Williamson was one of two prominent Democratic candidates who have attempted to challenge Biden's re-election. Along with her is Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who has blasted the Democratic Party for refusing to consider alternatives to Biden.

      "|Kamala Harris praises 'nonpartisan poll worker,' which immediately backfires when people learn who he is      |Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired. \"Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,\" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman. Instead of applauding a \"nonpartisan\" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers \"might want to know,\" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement. \"The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,\" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet. KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as \"the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.\" \"In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,\" it continues. He is also credited with training \"thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context. One user described Harris’ tweet as \"like a major self-own\" and said it was \"just sad.\" HALEY SAYS US WILL HAVE 'FEMALE PRESIDENT' — EITHER HERSELF OR KAMALA HARRIS \"Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,\" the user added. \"If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.\" \"Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?\" another added. One user responded: \"Vasu Abhiraman (left) is quite partisan, actually.\" \"I really appreciate community notes!\" added another.

      "|Marianne Williamson returns to presidential race, saying Biden is vulnerable against Trump                    |Self-help guru Marianne Williamson returned to the 2024 presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after announcing the suspension of her campaign. Williamson made the announcement in a video statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Williamson said she returned to the race because she feels President Biden is a vulnerable candidate to put up against former President Donald Trump. \"As of today, I am unsuspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,\" Williamson said. \"I had suspended it because I was losing the horse race. But something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond.\" \"Right now, we have a fascist standing at the door. Everybody's all upset about it. Well, we should be upset about it. But we're not going to defeat the fascist by – well, by what? What is President Biden offering?\" she asked. \"What is he saying beyond, ‘You know, the economy is doing really well.’?\" DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN LAYOFFS, VOWS TO REMAIN IN RACE: 'REALLY TOUGH DAY' \"We're still in this. Let's do this. This is serious,\" she added. \"We need to say to the American people, ‘we see your pain,’ and we need to say to Donald Trump, ‘we see your B.S.’\" MARIANNE WILLIAMSON APOLOGIZES TO BILL MAHER FOLLOWING ‘PERSONAL’ SPAT ON HIGHER EDUCATION: ‘OKAY, I’M SORRY' Williamson originally suspended her campaign on Feb. 7, dropping out of the race without making an endorsement. DEAN PHILLIPS DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM CAMPAIGN OPERATIVE WHO REPORTEDLY PAID $1 FOR AI-GENERATED BIDEN DEEPFAKE Williamson first ran for president in 2019 – also against Biden and a slew of other Democrats – and announced in early 2023 that she would be challenging the president again in 2024.  Williamson was one of two prominent Democratic candidates who have attempted to challenge Biden's re-election. Along with her is Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who has blasted the Democratic Party for refusing to consider alternatives to Biden.

      "|NY AG taunts Trump about interest he owes on civil fraud judgment                                             |New York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment. Trump's legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron's finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day. \"In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,\" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment. On Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a \"personal vendetta\" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, \"$464,576,230.62.\" \"+$114,553.04,\" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for. TRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE Again, on Feb. 25, James posted, \"+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.\" James' case also targeted Trump's family and the Trump Organization. Engoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for \"persistent and repeated fraud,\" \"falsifying business records,\" \"issuing false financial statements,\" \"conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,\" \"insurance fraud,\" and \"conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\" The former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves. Trump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron \"committed errors of law and/or fact\" and whether he abused his discretion or \"acted in excess\" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump's lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings. TRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR Trump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment. The Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount. There was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press. \"We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,\" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said. Trump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments. James, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.  Trump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was \"election interference\" and \"weaponization against a political opponent.\" Trump said he was being punished for \"having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.\" Fox News' Anders Hagstrom and The Associated Press contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",
      "|Hunter Biden testifies he 'did not involve' his father in his businesses, calls impeachment inquiry 'baseless'|Hunter Biden testified Wednesday that he \"did not involve\" his father in his businesses, while blasting House Republicans for having \"hunted\" him in their \"partisan political pursuit\" and impeachment inquiry into his father. Hunter Biden appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for his closed-door, deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Hunter Biden said Republicans have no evidence against his father \"because there isn't any,\" according to an opening statement obtained by Fox News. BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES \"I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business,\" Hunter Biden testified Wednesday morning. \"Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never.\" \"You read this fact in the many letters that have been sent to you over the last year as part of your so-called impeachment investigation. You heard this fact when I said it weeks ago, standing outside of this building. You heard this fact from a parade of other witnesses — former colleagues and business partners of mine, including my uncle — who have testified before you in similar proceedings. And now, today, you hear this fact directly from me,\" he continued in his opening statement. The first son said that for more than a year, the committees \"have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism — all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. \" \"You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any,\" he testified. The first son said House Republicans \"have built your entire partisan house of cards on lies told by\" past witnesses. Hunter Biden blasted his ex-business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, who also testified as part of the impeachment inquiry, and the since-indicted former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov. JOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES \"Rather than follow the facts as they have been laid out before you in bank records, financial statements, correspondence, and other witness testimony, you continue your frantic search to prove the lies you, and those you rely on, keep peddling. Yes, they are lies,\" he said. Hunter Biden, reflecting on \"mistakes\" he has made in his life, said he has \"squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.\" \"But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,\" he said. FLASHBACK: GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SHARE HUNTER BIDEN'S CHINA-LINKED BANK RECORDS WITH US ATTORNEY LEADING CRIMINAL PROBE Reflecting on his \"battle with addiction,\" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him. \"He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,\" he testified. \"What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.\" Hunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained. \"Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,\" he said. \"Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.\" FLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE He added: \"If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.\" The first son said he hopes his testimony will \"put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.\" \"You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,\" he testified. Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said \"there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,\" after his client's testimony. \"Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,\" Lowell said, adding: \"Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.\" Hunter Biden's testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden's younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden \"has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest\" in his business ventures. House Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son's former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family's business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him. Days before Bobulinski's testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with. After Walker's testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to \"now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.\" House Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses. \"The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,\" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. \"Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.\" Comer added that the committee will continue to investigate to \"determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.\"|\n",
      "|Haley slams Trump for Senate losses, calls out GOP lawmakers for courting him                                 |Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley blamed former President Trump Friday for recent Republican losses in critical electoral races, including those for seats in the Senate, while expressing hope the GOP's new leader in the upper chamber is focused on setting a tone rather than courting Trump. \"You're seeing the wave of what Congress thinks they need to do to win,\" Haley told reporters during a briefing at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood. Haley was likely referencing Trump's dominance over the House and Senate relative to endorsements and influence. But Haley suggested lawmakers who cater to the former president are misguided because Republicans have lost pivotal matchups since his presidency. SENATE REPUBLICANS KEEP HOPE FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT ALIVE \"All of these losses happened after Donald Trump became president in 2016,\" she said, noting gubernatorial, federal and statewide losses in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia. Haley claimed the only reason Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., was elected in 2021 was because \"he distanced himself\" from Trump. Youngkin's political team declined to comment to Fox News Digital. \"It’s not an accurate statement,\" according to Zack Roday, a former Youngkin adviser and partner at Ascent Media. DC PRIMARY REPRESENTS HALEY'S BEST CHANCE YET TO BEAT TRUMP \"Glenn Youngkin won because he built a movement and coalition of Republicans, independents and even Democrats who wanted a new direction for Virginia.\" Despite the losses, Haley claimed members of the House and Senate are now \"falling all over themselves to show that they're more Trump than everybody else.\" Haley weighed in on what the next Senate Republican leader should bring to the table after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's surprise announcement Wednesday that he's stepping down. She didn't suggest any specific senators for the role but explained she wants a leader focused on the people and \"not rewarding people for peacocking on TV.\" \"I want to see somebody inspirational. I want to see somebody that says, ‘You know what, we can do things differently,'\" Haley said. \"My hope is that we will. But we'll have to see.\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital the campaign's focus is now on Biden and the general election. \"Republican voters have delivered resounding wins for President Trump in every single primary contest, and this race is over,\" she said. SHIRTLESS GOP US SENATE CANDIDATE TAKES COLD PLUNGE IN WISCONSIN LAKE, CHALLENGES DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT So far, only Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has announced a bid for the leadership position in the Republican conference. But several other senators are rumored to be considering their own bids for the coveted role. Senators John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; John Thune, R-S.D.; Rick Scott, R-Fla.; Steve Daines, R-Mont.; and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., have all also been suggested as potential successors to McConnell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",
      "|Federal court rules Indiana's ban on gender-transitioning treatments for minors is enforceable                |Indiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer. A three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden. The bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana. U.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law's ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect. INDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS On Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court's ruling, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" for transgender minors, their families and doctors. \"As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,\" the statement read. \"We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.\" Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court's decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening. \"Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,\" he wrote. OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO The ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly. Representatives from the state's only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.  Twenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. The bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.

      "|White House calls for sanctuary cities to cooperate with ICE, amid furor over illegal immigrant crimes        |The White House is calling for \"sanctuary\" cities and jurisdictions across the U.S. to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in turning over criminal illegal immigrants for deportation, just as there is renewed scrutiny over such policies in the wake of several high-profile crimes committed by illegal immigrants who had previously been released by local law enforcement despite pleas from ICE. \"We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,\" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. \"When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE.\" \"Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals – the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,\" they said. Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers – which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in NYC, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer. SALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him. Biden will travel to the southern border in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. He will meet with Border Patrol, law enforcement and local leaders. The White House said he will renew his calls for Congress to pass a bipartisan border agreement, which would have increased staffing to the border as well as tightening asylum rules and increasing funding to communities and NGO’s receiving migrants. NYC MAYOR CONTINUES CALLS FOR SANCTUARY CITY AMENDMENT TO ALLOW DEPORTATION OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS \"He will discuss the urgent need to pass the Senate bipartisan border security agreement, the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades,\" a spokesperson said. \"He will reiterate his calls for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and to provide the funding needed for additional U.S. Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, fentanyl detection technology and more.\" Proponents of sanctuary policies argue that they are not obligated to help federal immigration enforcement and that it can encourage otherwise-lawful illegal immigrants to talk to police if they do not fear deportation. As a result, there are now sanctuary jurisdictions across the U.S. GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden had appeared supportive of such policies In a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden answered \"no\" when asked if \"undocumented immigrants\" arrested by local police should be turned over to immigration officials. In his first days in office, Biden’s administration announced a 100-day moratorium on all deportations, which was eventually blocked by a federal judge. It also reversed Trump-era limits on DOJ funding grants that were tied to cooperation with immigration enforcement, meaning that they excluded sanctuary cities. But Biden’s ICE has continued to criticize sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with them. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner recently told Fox News that such jurisdictions are \"inherently more unsafe.\" \"It is a concern, and I’m very baffled by it,\" he said. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas previously told mayors in 2022 that he would be seeking to convince leaders to change their policies. \"Some of your cities, by reason of past history, have declined to cooperate with immigration authorities in the removal, the apprehension and removal of individuals, even if those individuals pose a public safety threat. And I do not mean to suggest that distrust, if that is one of the concerns underlying policies such as that, I don't mean to do assert that that distrust is not earned,\" he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Mayorkas emphasized that under the administration, immigration enforcement is limited to recent border crosses, public safety threats and national security threats unlike under the Trump administration. \"But what I want to communicate to you is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the agency of today and what it is focused upon, and what it is doing, is not the agency of the past. We are not engaged in indiscriminate enforcement, but we are focused on making our communities safe and allowing those who have been contributors to it and productive members of it, to allow them to continue in their contributions and their productivity,\" he said. \"And so, I will be coming to you and asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation and see how we can work together,\" he said.  There are some indications that some sanctuary city leaders are now reconsidering their positions. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said multiple times this week that he wants to soften the policy. \"I don’t believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city,\" Adams said on Tuesday. He added, \"You don’t have the right to be in our city and tarnish the overwhelming number who are here following the rules.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",
      "|Legal experts say Jack Smith’s runway to try Trump before 2024 election ‘just got a lot shorter’              |The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted review of former president Trump’s claims of presidential immunity in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which throws into question at least the timeline for a possible trial in an election in which Trump is the likely GOP nominee. While some legal experts question the likelihood of success in Trump’s arguments, they say that the high court’s review sets back Smith's timeline to start a trial before an election and begs the question whether Attorney General Merrick Garland would — or should — approve going to trial just before the general election in November. Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, says \"the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter.\" \"I think that most people still believe that Smith can prevail before the Supreme Court. But the most immediate impact is that the runway for Jack Smith just got a lot shorter,\" Turley said in an interview with Fox News Digital. ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVES TRUMP FROM STATE BALLOT, CITING 'INSURRECTIONIST BAN' Smith’s \"primary fight for the last few months has been to secure a trial before the election,\" Turley said, adding that if the trial is after the election, \"there might not be a trial.\" Turley said that, should a decision come down from the Supreme Court as late as June, between a \"host\" of pre-trial motions and other procedural elements at the district court level — even if the district court were as \"motivated\" as Smith to get a trial scheduled before the election — the earliest a trial could start is the fall. Turley noted the Department of Justice has a longstanding practice of avoiding any prosecutorial action that could be perceived as political within a certain time frame before the election. HUNTER BIDEN FACES BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING HIS FATHER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BUSINESS DEALS: 'PERJURING HIMSELF' A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Justice Manual states, \"Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party. \"Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department’s mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution.\" While the DOJ can make timing requests of the court, it's ultimately up to a judge to set the court's calendar. \"The attorney general has a responsibility to maintain consistent application of departmental policy. This has nothing to do with the merits. Merrick Garland has been hands-off, has granted Smith almost total discretion as to the prosecution of the case. The timing of the case raises questions that remain within the attorney general's purview, in my view,\" Turley said. John Shu, a constitutional law expert who served in both the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, said all the Biden campaign and the Democrats need is for one of Trump’s trials to start before the general election.  \"If that happens, the news coverage will be 'all Trump trial all the time,’ especially if it’s televised, and no one is going to be talking about the economy, illegal immigration, wars in Israel and Ukraine, Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or super-high crime, gas prices, food prices and inflation,\" Shu said. \"It’ll be worse than the O.J. Simpson trial. \"The way Jack Smith has been acting, it indicates that he has been keeping his eye on the electoral calendar.\" \"This is all the more reason for the DOJ, in keeping with long-standing department policy in administrations from both parties, to delay trial if the date falls within two or three months before the presidential election,\" Shu added. On the merits of the case before the nine justices, Turley said, \"Trump will have a difficult time securing a majority in favor of the totality of his argument that Trump has offered a sweeping claim of immunity and is likely to produce a level of sticker shock for the justices.\" But, Turley said, \"the justices may have a similar reaction to the lower court’s opinion that some justices may be uncomfortable with — the lack of a clear line of when immunity will protect a president.\" SUPREME COURT AGREES TO REVIEW WHETHER TRUMP IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE \"The interesting aspect of this is that many of us expected that many of the justices would have wanted this cup to pass from their lips. If they had simply denied review, they would not establish any precedent on presidential immunity,\" Turley said. \"The court has not been keen on delineating the lines of presidential immunity. The opinions that they have issued have had a certain room at the elbows in terms of the use of this protection. \"So, this will force the court to set down some precedent. It's very likely that some of the justices would like to see greater acknowledgment of immunity for the president, for a future president.\"  Jim Trusty, former legal counsel for Trump and a former federal prosecutor, said \"the Trump team argument that he has absolute unqualified immunity while he's in office is not a winner.\" \"But I do think that there's a strong possibility that the court confirms that immunity protects the president, acting even in the furthest reaches of his responsibilities. That could well be enough to win the day on both Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago classified documents cases,\" Trusty said. The Justice Department declined to comment.

      "|Supreme Court divided over federal ban on bump stock gun accessory                                            |The Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons. The case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a \"bump stock\" device is a \"machine gun\" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires \"automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.\" After a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that \"bump stocks\" are machine guns. The Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court. GOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN'S 'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA': 'EXTREMIST POLICIES' Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several \"bump stocks\" under the ATF's rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action. \"It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That's going to be a job that's reserved for Congress ,\" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital. The conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power. But the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights. The justices' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect. \"I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,\" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.\" Justice Samuel Alito called that \"disturbing.\" \"These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,\" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"It's really not about the operation of the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what it's being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.\" A bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon's standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder. TEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT 'POWER' IN 'BUMP STOCK' BAN CASE As the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will \"bump\" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute. Bump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons. The carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them. GUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT' Before that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century. The ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed. The focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case. Both sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work. The government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire \"automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\" Lawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function. \"The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,\" said Justice Elena Kagan. \"So I don't understand why it's any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.\" After attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, \"Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?\" But other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.  \"Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it's functioning like a machine gun would,\" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, \"but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn't Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?\" The technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups. \"This is totally confusing,\" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions. \"Now I'm completely lost,\" added Sotomayor at one point. Cargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance. \"If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone's liberty is truly in jeopardy,\" said Mark Chenoweth, the group's president. Supporters of the ban say it saves lives. \"Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,\" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. \"ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.\" A ruling is due by early summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",
      "|Illinois judge removes Trump from state ballot, citing 'insurrectionist ban'                                  |An Illinois judge announced late Wednesday that former President Donald Trump has been removed from the state’s 2024 Republican presidential primary ballot over his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter barred Trump from the Illinois ballot one month after the anti-Trump challenge was dismissed by the Illinois State Board of Elections. According to court documents obtained by Fox News, Porter gave the order on Wednesday, urging the board to remove Trump or \"cause any votes cast for him to be suppressed,\" for violating section three of the 14th Amendment, or the \"disqualification clause,\" for engaging in insurrection. Porter's ruling reverses last month's decision by the Illinois Board of Elections to keep Trump's name on the primary ballot after a group of Illinois voters accused the former president of engaging in insurrection. REPUBLICAN EX-JUDGE ARGUED TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION, SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ILLINOIS PRIMARY BALLOT However, the order is put on hold until Friday, in case of an appeal from Trump's attorneys to the Illinois Appellate Court, First District or the Illinois Supreme Court. A campaign spokesperson for Trump issued a statement to Reuters saying it \"is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal.\" The U.S. Supreme Court is considering for the first time the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who \"engaged in insurrection\" from holding public office again. The 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the Constitution states, \"No person shall… hold any office… under the United States… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States… to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\" TRUMP SAYS HE'S A 'BELIEVER' IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER ORAL ARGUMENTS IN COLORADO BALLOT CASE Trump has never been charged with inciting an insurrection. Nancy Pelosi took to X, formerly Twitter, to share her thoughts on the ruling. \"The Supreme Court is placing itself on trial with its decision to hear the former president’s total immunity claim. It remains to be seen whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president,\" Pelosi wrote. HOUSE DEMOCRAT FROM MAINE RIPS STATE'S DECISION TO TAKE TRUMP OFF BALLOT The court will make a decision no later than the end of June on whether Trump can be prosecuted for election interference, The Associated Press reports. Illinois is now the third state where Trump was booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine.  But those decisions were paused pending the appeal of the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court. The primary election is set for March 19.

      "|Biden calls climate change deniers 'Neanderthals' during border speech in Texas                               |President Biden began his remarks during a Thursday visit to the southern border in Texas by addressing a devastating wildfire in the state's panhandle and Oklahoma before calling climate change deniers \"neanderthals.\" Speaking in the border city of Brownsville, Biden first addressed the ongoing wildfire that has ravaged a portion of Texas and destroyed more than one million acres. \"I've flown over a lot of these wildfires since I've been president,\" Biden said. \"Flown over more land burned to the ground. All the vegetation gone more than the entire state of Maryland in square footage.\" US GRID OPERATORS WARN BIDEN'S POWER PLANT CRACKDOWN COULD TRIGGER 'SIGNIFICANT POWER SHORTAGES' \"The idea there's no such thing as climate change. I love that, man,\" he added. \"I love some of my Neanderthal friends who still think there's no climate change.\" Biden didn't mention Republicans, but he has criticized the GOP in the past for disputing global warming. When the National Climate Assessment, which details climate change impacts, was released in November 2023, Biden blasted the party. \"Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. Impacts are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious and more costly,\" he said at the time. \"None of this is inevitable.\" TIM SCOTT RIPS 'TWO-TIERED STANDARD\" BETWEEN TREATMENT OF TRUMP, BIDEN ON BORDER EXECUTIVE ACTION: VIDEO After his brief climate change remarks, he further criticized Congress for failing to pass bipartisan border legislation. \"This bill was on its way to being passed. Then it was derailed by rank-and-file politics,\" he said. \"The U.S. needs to reconsider this bill and those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on the merits.\" \"The majority of Republicans and Democrats in both houses support this legislation until someone came along and said ‘Don’t do that. It'll benefit the incumbent,'\" Biden added. \"That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.  He urged former President Trump to \"join me\" in telling Congress to pass a border security bill. Earlier, Biden visited the Rio Grande and received briefings from Homeland Security officials. Meanwhile, Trump also visited the border some 300 miles away from his successor in Eagle Pass, Texas. \"This is a Joe Biden invasion,\" Trump said of the border crisis.

      "|House GOP lawmakers from Georgia blame Biden's 'disastrous' border policies for murder of Laken Riley         |FIRST ON FOX: Republican lawmakers from Georgia are blaming President Biden’s \"disastrous\" border and immigration policies for the murder of 22-year-old Laken Riley at the hands of an illegal migrant. Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was found dead on the University of Georgia campus Thursday after her roommate reported to authorities that she had not returned home from her morning run. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., led the Georgia Republican Congressional delegation in writing a letter to President Biden on Wednesday. Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had \"devastating consequences,\" and demands immediate action. BIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: 'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE' The University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening. The suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City. \"Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,\" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. \"Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.\" TRUMP BLAMES 'BIDEN'S BORDER INVASION' FOR LAKEN RILEY MURDER, VOWS 'LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION' IF ELECTED They added, \"Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.\" \"Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,\" they wrote. The GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he \"should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.\" \"The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,\" they wrote, adding that Biden should \"immediately revoke your harmful executive orders\" and \"issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.\" Biden \"should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,\" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra. BIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION \"Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,\" they continued. \"We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.\" The letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Loudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder \"has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.\" \"President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,\" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. \"His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.\" \"Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,\" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.\" She added, \"It’s past time to act.\" The letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired. \"We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,\" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.\"  The demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement. Meanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas. Trump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the \"invasion\" that led to Riley’s death.

      "|Mitch McConnell stepping down as Republican leader                                                            |Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November. McConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders. \"One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,\" he said in his floor speech. \"So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.\" The dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell's handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. MCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’ McConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, \"I don't know that I can work with [McConnell].\" Though the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator's health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters. \"As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.\" Looking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for \"the next generation\" to assume leadership in the Senate. TRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM' \"There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,\" he said. \"I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.\" McConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks. His speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife's youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted \"a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.\" \"Perhaps it's God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,\" McConnell said. \"I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I'd prefer.\" McConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as \"Mitch O'Donnell\" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years. REPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH In the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan's view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine. As majority leader during Trump's first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench. In 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day. The move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion. Though hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending. On the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell's lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo. Florida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10. Reacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell's leadership and honored his decades-long career in government. RAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT \"Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. \"He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.\" North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell \"a true legend of the U.S. Senate\" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine. \"He has stayed true to President Reagan's principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine's fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch's friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,\" Tillis said. \"He leaves very big shoes to fill.\"  Others were less kind. \"I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. \"But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.\" Fox News Digital's Jamie Joseph, Liz Elkind, Julia Johnson and Michael Ruiz, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",
      "|Haley says US will have 'female president' — either herself or Kamala Harris                                  |Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says that there is going to be a female president soon — either herself or Vice President Kamala Harris. Haley made the remarks during a Thursday interview on CNN with anchor Jake Tapper. \"Donald Trump will not win the general election,\" Haley told Tapper. \"You can have him win any primary you want, he will not win a general election.\" HALEY ON WHETHER TRUMP WILL CLINCH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION NEXT MONTH: 'LET'S SEE IF IT HAPPENS' \"We will have a female President of the United States, it will either be me or it will be [Vice President Kamala] Harris.\" Haley's comments seem to indicate she believes President Biden will either not stand for re-election or will not be able to complete his term, turning the Oval Office over to Harris. Haley, who is trailing Trump significantly in her home state of South Carolina, has not yet won a Republican primary. TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS ‘A**-KICKING' FOR HALEY IN HER HOME STATE, BUT SHE SAYS ‘I REFUSE TO QUIT’ Regardless, the former U.N. ambassador asserts that she is the only viable candidate in the general election. \"If Donald Trump is the nominee, you can mark my words, he will not win a general election,\" Haley said in the interview. Haley has repeatedly pledged to stay in the Republican presidential nomination race at least through March 5, when 15 states hold contests on Super Tuesday.  She faces an extremely steep uphill climb to win the nomination against the former president, who remains the commanding frontrunner in the GOP race as he bids a third straight time for the White House. \"We are focused on every state before us. Now it’s South Carolina on Saturday. Then it will be Michigan, then it will be Super Tuesday states, and we’ll take it from there,\" Haley told Fox News Digital interview on Wednesday.

      "|Lloyd Austin to face grilling from lawmakers over secret hospital visits                                      |Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January. Austin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark. Lawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move. Austin's frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care. FATHERS, UNCLE OF MARINES KILLED IN CALIFORNIA HELICOPTER CRASH SPEAK OUT: ‘SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED’ MARINE KILLED IN CAMP PENDLETON TRAINING EXERCISE IDENTIFIED The Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin's hospitalization. The review, carried out by Austin's subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was \"no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.\" Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call. DOJ SAYS MERRICK GARLAND TO TRANSFER POWER DURING UPCOMING BACK SURGERY AFTER BIDEN DEFENSE DEPT CONTROVERSY Hicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU. Austin's remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.  \"I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,\" Austin said at the time. \"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",
      "|Americans question why Nikki Haley remains in GOP primary: 'She's out of control'                             |Americans questioned why Nikki Haley is still in the Republican primary as GOP front-runner former President Trump continues to dominate elections, even in the former South Carolina governor's home state. \"She probably should drop out,\" Pete told Fox News while on Music City's famous Broadway street. \"I understand what she's doing, I understand why she's doing it, but she needs to get out.\" But Jodi said \"she should still stay in the race.\" \"She's a better candidate than Trump,\" she added. WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Haley is the only remaining challenger to Trump, who is so far undefeated heading into Super Tuesday on Mar. 5, when voters in 16 states will cast their ballot this primary season. Most recently, Trump earned over 40% more votes than Haley in Michigan on Tuesday and beat her by 20% in her home state on Saturday. \"I think she has absolutely no chance against the man,\" Oscar told Fox News the day before Michigan's primary. \"I voted in the New Hampshire primary … When Trump won, I think that was a defining moment where everybody realized that he's going to be the candidate once again.\" \"I really don't know what she's doing,\" he continued. \"She's out of control.\" Similarly, Scott said, \"she needs to get out\" of the race. \"It's just a waste of money for her to stay in,\" he added. KOCH-BACKED NETWORK DROPS FUNDING FOR NIKKI HALEY CAMPAIGN AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA DEFEAT Several people said funding from big donors has kept her in the race. Since the start of the primaries, the largest Haley-aligned super PAC has received donations from Wall Street megadonors, big names like billionaire Charles Koch’s political network, Americans for Prosperity Action and even a top Democratic donor, Reid Hoffman. \"She’s getting funded by the other side. That's what they do.\" George said. \"If they can't win their side, they will fund somebody else's side just to try to get her in.\" But Dan said he had \"no idea why there would be any money behind her whatsoever.\" \"She’s got no path to victory,\" he continued. Theresa said: \"She's just been encouraged by a lot of the anti-Trump people to stay in. It just hurts the party, I think.\" Some said Haley was only staying in the race to swoop in as the nominee if Trump, for some reason, becomes ineligible amid his ongoing legal battles. Trump is fighting four separate lawsuits and dozens of felony charges while seeking to lock up the Republican presidential nomination. \"I think she's just staying in hopes that something happens with Trump,\" Scott told Fox News. \"Whether it's legal issues or something that's going to knock him out.\"  Similarly, Pete said the only reason she refuses to drop out is because \"we don't really know what's going to happen with Trump.\" \"I like Trump,\" he said. \"Will he be there? I hope he's there in the end, but I can't guarantee he will be.\" But Josh said Haley's effort \"seems pointless.\" \"It seems like an inevitable match-up between Trump and Biden again at this point,\" he told Fox News, \"which I don't really think anyone wants. So it’s surprising that that continues to happen.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
      "|Google Gemini invented fake reviews smearing my book about Big Tech’s political biases                        |Google Gemini, the tech giant’s new AI chatbot meant to rival ChatGPT, invented several fake reviews – which it attributed to real people – meant to discredit my 2020 book on political biases at Google and other big tech companies. On Sunday, amid a sharp backlash against Google over its AI program’s apparent political biases, I asked Gemini to explain what my book was about. My book, \"The Manipulators: Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Big Tech's War on Conservatives,\" was a multi-year project on Big Tech’s political biases that drew on inside sources, leaked documents and more. I was curious to see if Google's AI program could be trusted to accurately describe an investigative book about Google, but I wasn't prepared for just how misleading it would be. CHATGPT FALSELY ACCUSES JONATHAN TURLEY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, CONCOCTS FAKE WAPO STORY TO SUPPORT ALLEGATION Gemini's description of my book included this sentence: \"The book has been criticized for lacking concrete evidence and relying on anecdotal information.\" Unsure what it was referencing — I thought I would have remembered such criticisms of my own book – I followed up: \"Who has criticized the book for lacking concrete evidence, as you say?\" What came next floored me. Gemini spat out summaries of four negative reviews, ostensibly from the Washington Free Beacon, The New York Times, The New York Times Book Review and Wired, including quotes from each: \"Book review by Matthew Continetti in The Washington Free Beacon: This review criticizes the book for relying on ‘anecdotal evidence’ and ‘cherry-picking examples’ to support its claims. Book review by Emily Bazelon in The New York Times Book Review: This review notes that the book 'lacks a deep understanding of how these companies work' and relies on 'unproven accusations.' Article by Emily Dreyfuss in Wired: This article explores the ‘dearth of evidence’ for the book's claims about Big Tech bias and highlights examples of cherry-picking. Article by Ben Smith in The New York Times: This article discusses the book's lack of rigorous research and its reliance on 'unsubstantiated claims.'\" But here’s the catch. None of those reviews were real. Not one. And neither were any of the quotes. The Free Beacon did publish a review of my book, but unlike Gemini’s fake review, it was overwhelmingly positive, describing The Manipulators as an \"excellent\" and \"thoroughly-researched\" book that \"should leave any sensible reader, conservative or otherwise, outraged.\" (Not to mention that the Free Beacon review invented by Gemini was attributed to Matthew Continetti, whereas Charles Lehman wrote the real review.) I immediately asked Gemini for links to the reviews it cited – knowing they didn’t exist – at which point the chatbot clammed up: \"I do not have enough information about that person to help with your request. I am a large language model, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions, but my knowledge about this person is limited. Is there anything else I can do to help you with this request?\"  Two more efforts to get an explanation from the chatbot received the exact same answer. I reached out to Google for an explanation.

      "|Key witness in Fani Willis case testifies he may have lied in texts about friends' affair                     |Former law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade's personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn't claim attorney-client privilege. Bradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn't recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade's romantic relationship with Willis. Defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded \"absolutely\" in the text exchange. When confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter \"dang.\" But then he said he was \"speculating\" in those comments. FANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS Attorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on \"lies about your friends.\" \"Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?\" Rice asked. \"I could have had, I don't know,\" Bradley responded. Bradely said he couldn't recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade's relationship with Willis once with Wade. FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR Bradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an \"in-camera\" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege. Bradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn't spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years. Bradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade's divorce. McAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley's testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday's testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday. Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an \"improper\" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case. Earlier this month, Willis' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments. Floyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings. During their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations. Michael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations. The crux of the defense's case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified. GEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions. The defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office. Both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former \"good friend\" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office. Yeartie said she had \"no doubt\" Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference. She testified to observing Willis and Wade \"hugging\" and \"kissing\" and showing \"affection\" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a \"romantic\" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022. Willis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend. The highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as \"belligerent.\"  She verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day. McAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it’s \"clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.\" Fox News Digital's Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",
      "|Rep. Andy Kim gains traction in bid for New Jersey's Senate seat after primary victories in 3 counties        |Rep. Andy Kim's wins in three state county committee votes have generated momentum for his bid for New Jersey's open Senate seat. In New Jersey's Democratic stronghold, primaries have a history of deciding elections. Although Gov. Phil Murphy has secured support from influential party bosses, Kim's victories suggest a tough race for the Democratic nomination. When New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy walked up to Rep. Andy Kim last weekend to congratulate him with a handshake after his third consecutive win in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, the goodwill gesture represented a surprise within a surprise. The Senate seat only became competitive because incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted last year on federal corruption charges. And Kim's wins in three state county committee votes so far have fueled sudden momentum for the mild-mannered three-term congressman, who is mounting a more formidable challenge than is typical against a well-connected political figure in a state where connections count for a lot. That matters in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey, where Democratic primaries often decide elections — and where primary winners are sometimes chosen by party leaders in behind-the-scenes gatherings well ahead of the primaries themselves. Kim sued this week in federal court to challenge the way counties draw ballots to favor candidates with party support. ANDY KIM SEES 3RD STRAIGHT WIN OVER NEW JERSEY FIRST LADY TAMMY MURPHY IN PRIMARY BATTLE FOR BOB MENENDEZ SEAT As surprising as they were, Kim's wins in three counties so far, including his and the first lady’s home turf, hardly settle anything. Murphy, who comes from the world of high finance and has spent years cultivating allies among state party leaders, has already secured the support of party bosses in the more populous counties of Bergen, Camden and Essex. Menendez has yet to say whether he will seek another term. The charges against him have generated spectacular headlines and are seen by many to be career-ending. The senator has pleaded not guilty and projected a defiant stance as turmoil suddenly engulfed a seat that had long been seen as safe for Democrats. TOUGH RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION Still, the wins by Kim suggest that the race for the Democratic nomination won't be easy for anyone. It pits Kim, perhaps best known for being spotted cleaning debris from the U.S. Capitol after the Jan. 6 insurrection three years ago, against Murphy, who is married to Gov. Phil Murphy and has made maternal mortality her signature issue in her role as first lady. Kim's lawsuit signals that he still believes New Jersey's way of giving better ballot positioning to candidates favored by local insiders could give Murphy an unfair advantage, a view shared by many political observers. \"We do not have competitive primaries. We in theory have them, but in practice we have party leaders who get behind closed doors and the nominee is presented to the public as a fait accompli. This is your candidate, love it or lump it,\" said Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"The fact that we’re actually having this primary is a sign something has gone awry.\" The competition between Kim and Murphy began almost as soon as the Menendez indictment was announced. It gave New Jersey a rare competitive Democratic primary for one of only three statewide seats — the others, for a second Senate seat and governor, aren’t on the ballot this year. The seat may yet remain in Democratic hands, but a contentious campaign could consume energy and resources as the party gears up for a grinding presidential campaign and the larger fight to control Congress. Kim cast his candidacy in terms of the public's distrust of officials and party insiders, pointing specifically to Menendez's indictments. A 2015 federal corruption indictment against Menendez ended in a hung jury and with prosecutors dropping the case. The concern, Kim said in an interview, is that progressive Democrats who oppose the party bosses' influence and independents might sit out the November election if they think Murphy's candidacy was foisted on them. \"If the Democrats don’t fix this and show that this is a credible and legitimate process, I think that this Senate seat could be in jeopardy this November. And I think that that’s something I absolutely refuse to see happen because I’ve been there in Congress. I know exactly what the Republicans would do if they have the majority in the Senate,\" Kim said. Tammy Murphy, who worked at Goldman Sachs briefly and helped start a policy think tank in New Jersey, pushed back at the notion that the support she has is based on her marriage to Phil. She said Saturday she isn't asking for his help. She also defended her departure from the Republican Party, which she left shortly before her husband's run for governor in 2017. \"I’ve been on the ground for the last eight years, literally building the party,\" she said. \"I’ve shown up serially in all these, all the red counties where they needed help. I showed up.\" She added: \"Many people are leaving the Republican Party here now, and I will tell you, I have stood for the same values since day one. Absolutely the same values.\" REPUBLICAN HOPES The possibility of Republicans picking up the seat in November is overblown, Cassino said, in large part because the state tilts so overwhelmingly Democratic and because it's an election year. Ben Dworkin, who heads the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, echoed that sentiment, pointing out Republicans haven't been elected to the Senate in New Jersey since 1972. Republicans are grappling with their own primary, featuring southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw, Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and former TV news reporter Alex Zdan. Also running in the Democratic primary are labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and civil rights activist Lawrence Hamm. GOV. MURPHY $55.9B BUDGET FEATURES SPENDING HIKES, NEW BUSINESS TAXES Shortly before the Burlington Democratic Party results were announced Saturday, voters leaving the hall greeted each other with smiles and hugs. Kim and Murphy both stopped to chat with people. Murphy had talked earlier in the day about needing to send \"ticked off\" moms to Washington to fight for families. Kim had focused on being a county native and said he'd fight for the state particularly in light of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the threat to the country's democracy. A number of voters acknowledged the awkwardness of having the first lady and their congressman competing and declined to say which one they supported. But they sounded more certain about their resolve to win in November. \"We’ll come together,\" said Gina LaPlaca, a local official in Burlington County. \"The threat from Republicans is too much.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",
      "|Jeb Bush comes to Trump’s defense after $355M fraud judgment: 'Damage could cascade'                          |Former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came to the defense of former President Trump in a Wall Street Journal op-ed slamming the recent New York civil fraud court case that ordered the 45th president to pay a $354.8 million fine plus interest. \"Every American has a right to be critical of Mr. Trump’s politics—one of us ran against him in 2016,\" reads Bush’s op-ed, titled, \"Elon Musk and Donald Trump Cases Imperil the Rule of Law.\" \"…But equality before the law is precious, and these rulings represent a crisis not only for the soundness of our courts, but for the business environment that has allowed the U.S. to prosper,\" the opinion piece continued. \"If these rulings stand, the damage could cascade through the economy, creating fear of arbitrary enforcement against entrepreneurs who seek public office or raise their voices as citizens in a way that politicians dislike.\" The column, which was co-authored by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, railed against the recent monthslong civil fraud trial against Trump, which resulted in a nearly $355 million fine and bars Trump from operating his business in New York for three years. The opinion piece also spoke out against how a Delaware judge recently rescinded tech billionaire Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation from Tesla. TRUMP BLASTS 'CLUBHOUSE POLITICIAN' JUDGE AFTER BEING FINED $350M, DEFENDS THE 'GREAT COMPANY' HE BUILT Bush ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election, when the two exchanged repeated barbs, including personal jabs such as Trump claiming Bush is an \"embarrassment to his family.\" In 2018, Bush said Trump is \"Republican in basically name only\" and took another apparent stab at the then-president, saying after he bowed out of the primary that he returned home where his children \"actually love me.\" Following Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, the former Florida governor said Trump \"provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol today.\" \"He has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection,\" Bush said in a post at the time. \"Mr. President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy.\" TRUMP BACKS GEORGE P. BUSH, JEB'S SON, IN TEXAS POLITICAL RACE The op-ed marks a defense of Bush's former 2016 rival, albeit not for Trump’s political stances. Instead, Lonsdale and Bush are calling for a \"dispassionate\" legal system that will not throttle businesses and lead to a weakened economy. \"​​New York and Delaware have played an outsize role in business in the U.S.\" the pair wrote. \"Many major companies are incorporated in Delaware owing to the state’s body of corporate legal precedents; and a significant number of banks operate in New York, the world financial capital. The appellate courts in those states now have a chance to review these dangerous judicial rulings and try to stop further damage to the reputations of their respective judiciaries.\" \"If they don’t, blue-state politicians may have the satisfaction of ‘sticking it’ to Messrs. Trump and Musk, but the loss to those states will be significant,\" they continued. \"The damage to the legal fabric of the country will be even worse. A dispassionate justice system is at the heart of American exceptionalism, and the country will be poorer if we lose it.\" Trump has since appealed the ruling and repeatedly argued that the presiding judge, Arthur Engoron, and New York Attorney General Letitia James were politically motivated in the case. FORMER TRUMP RIVAL JEB BUSH CALLS MANHATTAN GRAND JURY INDICTMENT 'VERY POLITICAL' \"A crooked New York judge working with the very corrupt attorney general of New York State, who ran on the basis of ‘I will get trump’ before knowing me — before even knowing anything about me — just ruled that I have to pay a fine of $355 million based on absolutely nothing,\" Trump told Fox News Digital after the fine was announced. \"No victims. No damages. Great financial statements, with full disclaimer clauses, only success.\" NEW YORK AG TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER TRUMP FRAUD RULING: 'JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED' The op-ed noted that when James was on the campaign trail for the attorney general position, she ran on a campaign \"promise to target the man she called 'an illegitimate president.’\" \"The unusual New York law Ms. James used to investigate and sue Mr. Trump didn’t require her to prove that he had intended to defraud anyone, or even that anyone lost money. The Associated Press found that of the 12 cases brought under that law since its adoption in 1956 in which significant penalties were imposed, the case against Mr. Trump was the only instance without an alleged victim or financial loss,\" the pair wrote.  Trump attorneys had asked Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an \"orderly post-judgement process,\" which was denied Thursday afternoon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

      "Kamala Harris praises 'nonpartisan poll worker,' which immediately backfires when people learn who he is\n",
      "Vice President Harris took to social media to praise the efforts of poll workers amid the presidential primaries and just months ahead of the 2024 election, but her complimentary remarks quickly backfired. \"Our democracy could not function without nonpartisan poll workers like Vasu and Rob whom I met in Georgia. President Biden and I thank you and we support you,\" she said Tuesday on X, sharing a photo of her appearing to listen to Vasu Abhiraman. Instead of applauding a \"nonpartisan\" poll worker, X’s Community Notes immediately tagged the tweet with additional context that readers \"might want to know,\" including that Abhiraman is actually a liberal advocate who promotes the progressive movement. \"The ‘nonpartisan poll worker’ on the left is Vasu Abhiraman, a staffer at the left-wing Alliance for Justice and formerly of ACLU Georgia,\" reads a notice on Harris’ tweet. KAMALA HARRIS 'READY TO SERVE' AS DEMOCRATS SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE: REPORT Abhiraman’s biography on the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) website identifies him as \"the Helen Rosenthal Senior Counsel for the Building the Bench program at Alliance for Justice.\" \"In this role, he serves as a dedicated advocate for diversity and inclusion in the federal and state judiciary, working collaboratively with a coalition of organizations to identify and recruit potential candidates for the bench,\" it continues. He is also credited with training \"thousands of poll workers and deputy registrars to safeguard the democratic process during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Several X users immediately took notice of the additional context. One user described Harris’ tweet as \"like a major self-own\" and said it was \"just sad.\" HALEY SAYS US WILL HAVE 'FEMALE PRESIDENT' — EITHER HERSELF OR KAMALA HARRIS \"Kamala… it is posts like this that destroy your credibility,\" the user added. \"If your staff cannot vet these properly before posting, you need to fire them. We will always fact-check and investigate all claims like this.\" \"Vasu and Rob are non-partisan? Can you prove that?\" another added. One user responded: \"Vasu Abhiraman (left) is quite partisan, actually.\" \"I really appreciate community notes!\" added another. And, \"Community Notes FTW [for the win].\"  On its website, the AFJ says its mission is to \"build the strength of progressive movements by training and educating nonprofit organizations on advocacy, harnessing their collective power to transform our state and federal courts.\"\n",

The small number of nominating contests allowed the candidates to camp out and provide individual attention to each state.\\n\\nTuesday’s Michigan primary marks a major pivot away from that model. Neither candidate has been able to pay too much attention to the Wolverine State, which makes it a good testing ground for how the GOP primary process will unfold as the campaign becomes nationalized over the next three weeks.\\n\\nThis is likely very good news for the former president. Trump is the massive favorite in Michigan. Recent polling has been limited, but he led Haley 72% to 27% among likely GOP primary voters in a CNN/SSRS poll conducted at the end of last year. That lead was larger than his advantage in any of the final surveys leading up to the aforementioned three early nominating contests this primary season.\\n\\nNow, Haley was able to close the gap with Trump in New Hampshire and South Carolina after polls had previously shown her well behind. Even three weeks out from the Palmetto State primary, polls had Haley down by 35 points, but she lost by 20 points after weeks of campaigning.\\n\\nRead more about why Michigan's primary is key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |Live updates: Michigan presidential primary election  CNN                                            |\n",

Sam Wolfe/Reuters\\n\\nFormer President Donald Trump made his final pitch on February 15 to the Supreme Court in his effort to pause a trial over the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith.\\n\\n“There are overwhelming reasons why the case should not go to trial ‘in three months or less,’” Trump told the Supreme Court in a 16-page filing. “With any other defendant, it would be virtually unthinkable for the case to go to trial so soon, and ‘wildly unfair’ to do so.”\\n\\nTrump claims former presidents must have immunity from such charges to avoid political reprisals when they leave office. So far, two lower federal courts have balked at that argument.\\n\\nTrump asked the Supreme Court to block a unanimous decision from the DC Circuit handed down that rejected his claims of immunity from the election subversion charges. Smith argued in his own brief that Trump had not met the standard to pause proceedings in his case. It generally takes support from five justices to secure such a pause.\\n\\nIf the justices deny Trump’s emergency request to temporarily block a DC Circuit ruling against him on the immunity issue, it would clear the way for a US District Court in Washington to schedule a trial on the underlying election charges, which Smith is eager to finish before the November election.\\n\\nIf the justices agree to further consider his case, it could signal the justices may schedule oral arguments in the case later this year, potentially pushing a trial back several months.                                                                                                                                                                                               |Supreme Court to decide Trump immunity claim  CNN                                                    |\n",

Lynne Sladky/AP/File The morning session of the hearing in the classified documents case has ended without a decision from the judge on when the case will go to trial. Arguments Friday morning, though ostensibly about scheduling, also touched on discovery demands by the defendants because those demands could affect the timeline. Judge Aileen Cannon picked apart proposed trial schedules from special counsel Jack Smith and the defendants in the classified documents case. Prosecutors with the special counsel’s office have requested in court filings that the trial begin on July 8, while defense attorneys have proposed that Donald Trump and Carlos De Oliveira’s trial begin on August 12 and Walt Nauta’s trial begins September 9. In the hearing Friday, Cannon has had questions that picked apart the prosecution and defense proposed schedules, but she has not said much that shed light on how she is thinking about the timeline. Cannon has, however, stressed that there needs to be “some space” in the schedule leading up to the trial to “allow for flexibility,” particularly around the procedures for deciding how classified information will be handled in the case. ## Documents Case ##                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |Live updates: Trump classified documents hearing, Fani Willis disqualification closing arguments  CNN|[Live, updates, :, Trump, classified, documents, hearing, ,, Fani, Willis, disqualification, closing, arguments]|\n",
