That mark was more than 10 times the group\\'s stated goal, which was to get 10,000 people, or roughly the same as the margin of victory in the 2016 election in the state, to select the option.\\n\\nPOLL SHOWS BIDEN\\'S LEAD OVER TRUMP SHRINKING IN 2024 MATCHUP AS CONCERNS OVER PHYSICAL FITNESS GROW\\n\\nDespite the apparent resounding success, Biden easily captured the state and gained 115 delegates while hauling in over 81% of the vote, further solidifying his grasp on the nomination and setting up a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in November.\\n\\n\"I want to thank every Michigander who made their voice heard today. Exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy is what makes America great,\" Biden said in a statement after the Michigan victory while warning that there is \"much left to do\" to defeat Trump in November. \"You’ve heard me say many times it’s never a good bet to bet against the United States of America. It’s never a good bet to bet against Michiganders either. This fight for our freedoms, for working families, and for Democracy is going to take all of us coming together. I know that we will.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Listen to Michigan supporters have warned they are willing to continue growing the movement ahead of the general election, a potential headache for the Biden campaign in a battleground state that has seen close margins in the last two presidential elections.\\n\\nJAMES CARVILLE FRETS OVER \\'UNCOMMITTED\\' PROTEST VOTE AGAINST BIDEN IN MICHIGAN: \\'HUGE PROBLEM\\'\\n\\nReached for comment by Fox News Digital, a Biden campaign spokesperson noted that the share of uncommitted votes, 11%, was actually in line with the previous time an incumbent was on the ballot in the state in a Democratic primary, which was during the 2012 re-election campaign of Former President Barack Obama. Nevertheless, the spokesperson stressed that the campaign is still working hard to earn the votes of holdouts and will continue working towards peace in Gaza.\\n\\nBut the movement started by Listen to Michigan may not be in Biden\\'s rearview mirror after Michigan, with the group saying activists in future primary states have reached out about joining the cause.\\n\\n\"Two of the states where organizers have reached out specifically are Minnesota and Washington State,\" a Listen to Michigan spokesperson said during Wednesday\\'s news conference. \"We have our eye on those states… and are ready to have conversations with anybody organizing for an anti-war future.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe organization has also brushed off suggestions that it may at least indirectly help Trump regain the presidency, arguing that it is up to Biden to earn their votes.\\n\\n\"We are not electing Donald Trump. President Biden is the one seeking the highest office, and he is the candidate who\\'s facing off against Donald Trump,\" Hammoud said. \"He has to earn the votes of the constituency that he\\'s trying to serve.\"',\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court offered divided thoughts and a measure of confusion on Wednesday over whether the federal government can ban so-called bump stocks, a device that increases the firepower of automatic weapons.\\n\\nThe case, Garland v. Cargill, presents whether a \"bump stock\" device is a \"machine gun\" as defined by federal law because it is designed and intended for use in converting a rifle into a weapon that fires \"automatically more than one shot... by a single function of the trigger.\"\\n\\nAfter a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 60 people dead and 500 more wounded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued an interpretive rule concluding that \"bump stocks\" are machine guns.\\n\\nThe Trump administration initiated a ban on the devices – reversing earlier regulations – and the Biden Justice Department is now defending it in court.\\n\\nGOP SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO DEFEND GUN DEALERS FROM BIDEN\\'S \\'GUN-GRABBING AGENDA\\': \\'EXTREMIST POLICIES\\'\\n\\nMichael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works, sued the government after he was forced to surrender several \"bump stocks\" under the ATF\\'s rule. He says the agency overstepped its administrative authority to impose a ban, absent any congressional action.\\n\\n\"It really goes back to… freedom. And it goes back to just the basics of something that my customers and myself legally purchase. The government should not have that power, that authority in an administrative agency… to come back and ban that. You know, something that Congress has not banned. That\\'s going to be a job that\\'s reserved for Congress ,\" Cargill said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\\n\\nThe conservative high court majority has been generally supportive of the Second Amendment in recent years, and several justices suggested the government here overstepped its power.\\n\\nBut the nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments signaled the nine-member bench viewed the case as more about regulatory authority and less about expanded gun rights.\\n\\nThe justices\\' questions were focused mainly on exactly how bump stocks work, and their functional effect.\\n\\n\"I can certainly understand why these items should be made illegal, but we\\'re dealing with a statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and through many administrations, the government took the position that these bump stocks are not machine guns,\" said Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"And then you adopted an interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule, saying otherwise that would render between a quarter of a million and a half million people federal felons.\"\\n\\nJustice Samuel Alito called that \"disturbing.\"\\n\\n\"These are the kind of weapons that Congress was intending to prohibit because of the damage they cause,\" said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"It\\'s really not about the operation of the thing. It\\'s about what it can achieve, what it\\'s being used for... The function of this trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 rounds a second or whatever.\"\\n\\nA bump stock is an attachment that replaces an automatic weapon\\'s standard stock, the part of the long weapon that rests on the shoulder.\\n\\nTEXAS GUN STORE OWNER SAYS SUPREME COURT SHOULD LIMIT GOVERNMENT \\'POWER\\' IN \\'BUMP STOCK\\' BAN CASE\\n\\nAs the shooter applies forward thrust on the barrel, the device harnesses the recoil energy so that the trigger will \"bump\" against the stationary finger, which then allows another round to be fired. The effect is more rapid shots than with a standard stock, up to 800 bullets a minute.\\n\\nBump stocks came into circulation early this century, one of a number of devices that can be attached to automatic weapons.\\n\\nThe carnage at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Nevada – where the gunman fired more than a thousand rounds from 14 semi-automatic rifles outfitted with bump stocks – prompted the Trump administration to quickly ban them.\\n\\nGUN OWNERS DUNK ON SHAQ FOR SPONSORING FIREARM BUYBACK EVENT IN RED STATE: \\'ABSOLUTELY NOT\\'\\n\\nBefore that, the ATF for more than a decade had determined the devices did not convert them into machine guns, which have been illegal to own for nearly a century.\\n\\nThe ATF says more than a half-million bump stocks were in circulation when the federal ban came into effect five years ago, requiring them to be turned in or destroyed.\\n\\nThe focus of arguments came down to a technical inquiry into how gun triggers are enhanced by the addition of a bump stock. Several on the court admitted watching videos of bump stocks in a simulated environment, as part of the briefs submitted in the case.\\n\\nBoth sides presented radically different ideas of just how these accessories work.\\n\\nThe government told the justices bump stocks allow a gun user to fire \"automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\"\\n\\nLawyers for the gun dealer argued that despite enhancing the firepower, the effect was still a manual, not an automatic function.\\n\\n\"The entire point of this device is that you exert forward pressure and you have your finger on the trigger, and then a torrent of bullets shoots out,\" said Justice Elena Kagan. \"So I don\\'t understand why it\\'s any different from pushing a button and holding the trigger.\"\\n\\nAfter attorney Jonathan Mitchell suggested bump stocks might help someone with a medical condition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, \"Why would even a person with arthritis, why would Congress think they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of ammunition under any circumstance?\"\\n\\nBut other questions from the bench went back to what legislators have not done on this issue.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"Intuitively I am entirely sympathetic to your argument, and it seems it\\'s functioning like a machine gun would,\" said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, \"but looking at that definition, the question is, why didn\\'t Congress pass that legislation to cover this more clearly?\"\\n\\nThe technical analysis undertaken during arguments was not without its hiccups.\\n\\n\"This is totally confusing,\" said Alito at one point. Jackson used the same word on several other occasions.\\n\\n\"Now I\\'m completely lost,\" added Sotomayor at one point.\\n\\nCargill, an Army veteran, is being defended in court by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.\\n\\n\"If a federal agency can issue a rule that makes people felons for owning a device the agency had repeatedly and consistently approved as lawful for more than a decade, then everyone\\'s liberty is truly in jeopardy,\" said Mark Chenoweth, the group\\'s president.\\n\\nSupporters of the ban say it saves lives.\\n\\n\"Fully automatic firearms – and conversion devices – are already heavily regulated under federal law, with good reason,\" said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director at the Giffords Law Center. \"ATF’s classification of bump stocks as machine guns is simply common sense, and in line with congressional intent to regulate workarounds to the machine gun regulations.\"\\n\\nA ruling is due by early summer.',\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nThe murder of a Georgia nursing student allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested in New York City is the \"direct result\" of recent New York City laws that severed ties between the NYPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Republican Councilman Joe Borelli argued.\\n\\n\"It is a direct result of the City Council passing legislation that limits cooperation. If those laws were not enacted, the Department of Corrections would have given ICE the opportunity to issue a detainer against Jose Ibarra,\" Borelli told Fox News Digital in a phone interview this week.\\n\\nGeorgia nursing student Laken Hope Riley, 22, was discovered beaten to death earlier this month after going for a run on the University of Georgia’s campus. The Augusta University student crossed paths with illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra, according to authorities, and died from blunt force trauma to the head.\\n\\nIbarra, a Venezuelan national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and was granted border \"parole,\" which allows noncitizens to temporarily enter the country due to an emergency or humanitarian reason, authorities have said. Ibarra soon made his way up to New York City, where he was arrested in August and \"charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,\" according to ICE.\\n\\n7.2M ILLEGALS ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES\\n\\nThe NYPD, however, has said it does not have a record of Ibarra\\'s arrest.\\n\\nTypically, when ICE learns an illegal immigrant is arrested on criminal charges, the agency will issue a detainer that requests the local police department hold the suspect until ICE can take over and begin deportation proceedings.\\n\\nIn Ibarra’s case, ICE said he was released by the NYPD before a detainer could be issued.\\n\\nNew York City, however, is a \"sanctuary city\" with relatively recent laws passed by City Council severing many ties between the NYPD and ICE.\\n\\nLAKEN RILEY CASE: HECKLERS SHOUT DOWN ATHENS MAYOR AS HE DENIES SANCTUARY CITY, ANNOUNCES PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDS\\n\\n\"A woman is dead in Georgia because the New York City Council passed local laws barring the NYPD from cooperating with ICE, and as such the suspect was released without any notification to federal law enforcement,\" Borelli tweeted this week, accompanied by a list of laws that restricted local cooperation with the immigration agency.\\n\\nUnder a pair of 2014 laws, the local Department of Corrections and NYPD were restricted from complying with ICE detainers under certain conditions.

Public safety for all of our residents must come first,\" Adams said, according to the de Blasio-era press release.\\n\\nFollowing Laken Riley’s murder, Adams said this week that he supports altering city laws that would open the doors to New York City officials working with federal authorities on immigration matters involving violent suspects or repeat offenders.\\n\\n\"I want to go back to the standards of the previous mayors who I believe subscribed to my belief that people who are suspected of committing serious crimes in this city should be held accountable,\" Adams told reporters at City Hall Tuesday.\\n\\n\"We should not be allowing people who are repeatedly committing crimes to remain here, and we cannot collaborate with ICE in the process,\" the mayor added.\\n\\nAdams has repeatedly spoken out in support of keeping New York City as a sanctuary city, saying illegal immigrants in the Big Apple should not live in fear of receiving city services, such as attending a school, due to their immigration status.\\n\\nWhen asked about Borelli\\'s comments and the laws passed by City Council under his administration, de Blasio told Fox News Digital in a statement that it\\'s time for \"tougher border policies.\"\\n\\n\"I trust the NYPD, and they say they never encountered the accused individual. But it’s sickening that a young, promising life was cut short. Any way you slice it, we need tougher border policies and comprehensive immigration reform,\" de Blasio said.\\n\\nThe former mayor also pointed Fox Digital to an opinion piece he wrote this month, in which he proposed accepting \"Republican demands for greater border security in exchange for full funding of a humane and functioning asylum process,\" along with \"spending billions to create the facilities necessary on the Mexican side of the border, including the concessions and incentives the Mexican government would require in order to accept this plan.\"\\n\\nBorelli argued the push by the City Council to sever ties with federal authorities back when de Blasio was in office evolved from Democrats in the city wanting to resist what they saw as a \"Trump agenda\" on immigration.\\n\\n\"This was a reaction by the de Blasio administration and the City Council to push back on what they saw as the Trump agenda. And as long as they were doing what they could to oppose Trump, they didn\\'t care,\" he said.\\n\\nBorelli said the local legislation is now backfiring as New Yorkers and others question the laws’ logic.\\n\\n\"It\\'s completely backfired when people start to question, ‘What is the logic of having people who are here illegally in the first place, and then commit crimes against New Yorkers and others?’ There\\'s limited rationale for keeping them here, even if you were a progressive who is sympathetic to people coming here in the first place,\" Borelli said.\\n\\nLaken Riley’s murder has shocked many Americans and heightened outrage about the Biden administration’s border policies.

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will face a grilling from lawmakers in his first appearance before Congress since his secretive hospital visits in January.\\n\\nAustin will appear before the GOP-controlled House Armed Services Committee. Several lawmakers on the committee have blasted the secretary both for not informing Congress of his days-long hospital visit, but also for keeping President Biden in the dark.\\n\\nLawmakers are concerned the secretive move could have caused a breakdown in the chain of command stretching from the White House to the Pentagon. While Austin insists he transferred authority to a secretary during his hospital visit, concerns remain given he informed none of his superiors of the move.\\n\\nAustin\\'s frequent hospital visits come thanks to a prostate cancer diagnosis, which he received in December. The offending hospital visit came on January 1, when he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center via ambulance. He was soon transferred to intensive care.\\n\\nFATHERS, UNCLE OF MARINES KILLED IN CALIFORNIA HELICOPTER CRASH SPEAK OUT: ‘SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED’\\n\\nMARINE KILLED IN CAMP PENDLETON TRAINING EXERCISE IDENTIFIED\\n\\nThe Pentagon came under a barrage of criticism Monday following the release of an internal review of its handling of Austin\\'s hospitalization.\\n\\nThe review, carried out by Austin\\'s subordinates , largely absolves anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding the incident. The review states flatly that there was \"no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.\"\\n\\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters that Secretary Austin’s staff decided to transfer authority to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on January 2 as he was in the ICU. He said the secretary was never unconscious, though it remained unclear why his staff made that call.\\n\\nDOJ SAYS MERRICK GARLAND TO TRANSFER POWER DURING UPCOMING BACK SURGERY AFTER BIDEN DEFENSE DEPT CONTROVERSY\\n\\nHicks, meanwhile, was on vacation in Puerto Rico and did not learn of Austin’s hospitalization until three days later, after he was transported to the ICU.\\n\\nAustin\\'s remarks before the House Committee are likely to mirror the public apology he gave over the incident in early February. He said he personally apologized to Biden as well.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right and I did not handle this right,\" Austin said at the time. \"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.\"',\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James appeared to taunt former President Trump about the interest he may own in a civil fraud judgment.\\n\\nTrump\\'s legal team on Monday appealed a Feb. 16 ruling from New York Judge Arthur Engoron\\'s finding him liable for more than $350 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him by James. Engoron ordered Trump to pay just over $354 million, with post-judgment interest accruing at nearly $112,000 per day.\\n\\n\"In a massive victory, we won our case against Donald Trump for engaging in years of incredible financial fraud to enrich himself. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and his former executives must pay over $450 million in disgorgement and interest,\" James wrote on X, celebrating on the same day of the judgment.\\n\\nOn Feb. 23, James, who has denied having a \"personal vendetta\" against Trump despite remarks suggesting otherwise, posted flatly, \"$464,576,230.62.\"\\n\\n\"+$114,553.04,\" she added in another post the next day, referring to the potential added interest Trump may be on the hook for.\\n\\nTRUMP APPEALS RULING IN MASSIVE NY CIVIL FRAUD CASE\\n\\nAgain, on Feb. 25, James posted, \"+$114,553.04 = $464,805,336.70.\"\\n\\nJames\\' case also targeted Trump\\'s family and the Trump Organization.\\n\\nEngoron ruled that Trump and co-defendants – his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and two former Trump Organization executives – were liable for \"persistent and repeated fraud,\" \"falsifying business records,\" \"issuing false financial statements,\" \"conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,\" \"insurance fraud,\" and \"conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\"\\n\\nThe former president’s lawyers filed notices of appeal Monday, asking the state’s mid-level appeals court to overturn Engoron’s Feb. 16 verdict in James’ lawsuit and reverse staggering penalties that threaten to wipe out Trump’s cash reserves.\\n\\nTrump’s lawyers wrote in court papers that they are asking the appeals court to decide whether Engoron \"committed errors of law and/or fact\" and whether he abused his discretion or \"acted in excess\" of his jurisdiction. A notice of appeal starts the appeals process in New York. Trump\\'s lawyers will have an opportunity to expand on their grievances in subsequent court filings.\\n\\nTRUMP VISITS MANHATTAN COURT TO BLAST NYAG CASE, PRAISES APPELLATE RULING IN HIS FAVOR\\n\\nTrump was not required to pay his penalty or post a bond in order to appeal, and appealing will not automatically halt enforcement of the judgment.\\n\\nThe Republican presidential frontrunner has until March 25 to secure a stay, a legal mechanism pausing collection while he appeals. Trump would receive an automatic stay if he puts up money, assets or an appeal bond covering what he owes. Trump’s lawyers could also ask the appeals court to grant a stay without obtaining a bond or with a bond for a lower amount.\\n\\nThere was no indication on the court docket Monday that Trump had already posted an appeal bond or asked for a stay, according to The Associated Press.\\n\\n\"We trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York’s legal system,\" Trump lawyer Alina Habba said.\\n\\nTrump maintains that he is worth several billion dollars and testified last year that he had about $400 million in cash, in addition to properties and other investments.\\n\\nJames, a Democrat, told ABC News that if Trump is unable to pay, she will seek to seize some of his assets.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTrump said Engoron’s decision, the costliest consequence of his recent legal battles, was \"election interference\" and \"weaponization against a political opponent.\" Trump said he was being punished for \"having built a perfect company, great cash, great buildings, great everything.\"\\n\\nFox News\\' Anders Hagstrom and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nIndiana can now enforce a law banning minors from seeking gender-transitioning treatments after a federal appeals court ruled to remove a temporary injunction issued by a judge last year, which kept the ban from going into effect last summer.\\n\\nA three-judge panel from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down the decision on Tuesday. Two of the judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Trump, while the third judge was appointed by President Biden.\\n\\nThe bill, which was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 5, 2023, was set to become law on July 1, 2023, but was blocked by a judge a month prior following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge James Patrick Hanlon issued the injunction, which halted the parts of the law prohibiting minors from accessing hormone therapies and puberty blockers, and prohibiting Indiana doctors from communicating with out-of-state doctors about transgender-related treatments for minors. The law\\'s ban on gender-transitioning surgeries for minors was still allowed to take effect.\\n\\nINDIANA GOV. HOLCOMB GREENLIGHTS TRANS PROCEDURE BAN FOR MINORS\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the ACLU of Indiana issued a written statement in response to the appeals court\\'s ruling, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" for transgender minors, their families and doctors.\\n\\n\"As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over,\" the statement read. \"We will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.\"\\n\\nIndiana Attorney General Todd Rokita did not share those sentiments and praised the court\\'s decision in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuesday evening.\\n\\n\"Our commonsense state law, banning dangerous and irreversible gender-transition procedures for minors, is now enforceable following the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal’s newest order. We are proud to win this fight against the radicals who continue pushing this horrific practice on our children for ideological and financial reasons,\" he wrote.\\n\\nOHIO BANS \\'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE\\' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO\\n\\nThe ACLU of Indiana filed the lawsuit last year on behalf of four minors undergoing gender-transitioning treatments and a doctor providing such care. The organization argued that the ban violates the Constitution\\'s equal protection guarantees and strips parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children.\\n\\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, among other medical groups, claim minors can safely seek gender-transitioning treatments if they are being administered properly.\\n\\nRepresentatives from the state\\'s only hospital-based gender health program at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis told legislators last year that doctors do not perform or provide referrals for genital surgeries for minors, according to The Associated Press. The hospital was not involved in the lawsuit opposing the ban.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTwenty-two other states have also enacted laws restricting or banning gender-transitioning treatments for minors. They are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.\\n\\nThe bans are in limbo in some of those states as a federal court ruled Arkansas\\' ban is unconstitutional and temporary injunctions were placed on the laws in Idaho and Montana.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

Yes, they are lies,\" he said.\\n\\nHunter Biden, reflecting on \"mistakes\" he has made in his life, said he has \"squandered opportunities and privileges that were afforded to me. I know that. I am responsible for that. And I am making amends for that.\"\\n\\n\"But my mistakes and shortcomings are my own and not my father’s, who has done nothing but devote his entire life to public service and trying to make this country a better place to live,\" he said.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SHARE HUNTER BIDEN\\'S CHINA-LINKED BANK RECORDS WITH US ATTORNEY LEADING CRIMINAL PROBE\\n\\nReflecting on his \"battle with addiction,\" Hunter Biden said his father was there for him.\\n\\n\"He helped save my life. His love and support made it possible for me to get sober, stay sober and rebuild my life as a father, husband, son, and brother,\" he testified. \"What he got in return for being a loving and supportive parent is a barrage of hate-filled conspiracy theories that hatched this sham impeachment inquiry and continue to fuel unrelenting personal attacks against him and me.\"\\n\\nHunter Biden went on to point to records of his text messages, emails and other communications that the committees have obtained.\\n\\n\"Republicans have taken my communications out of context, relied on documents that have been altered, and cherry-picked snippets of financial or other records to misrepresent what really happened,\" he said. \"Examples of this include a few references to my family in emails or texts that I sent when I was in the darkest days of my addiction.\"\\n\\nFLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE\\n\\nHe added: \"If you try to do that again today, my answers will reveal your tactics and demonstrate the truth that my father was never involved in any of my businesses.\"\\n\\nThe first son said he hopes his testimony will \"put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.\"\\n\\n\"You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,\" he testified.\\n\\nHunter Biden\\'s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said \"there is nothing left to ask, answer, say, or do,\" after his client\\'s testimony.\\n\\n\"Republicans ended the day the same way they started it -- with no evidence to support their sham inquiry because it’s based on lies peddled by people convicted or charged with lying or fraud,\" Lowell said, adding: \"Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is -- on the record and under oath -- this political charade should finally come to an end.\"\\n\\nHunter Biden\\'s testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden\\'s younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden \"has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest\" in his business ventures.\\n\\nHouse Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son\\'s former business associates, like Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family\\'s business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.\\n\\nDays before Bobulinski\\'s testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of the Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.\\n\\nAfter Walker\\'s testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to \"now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.\"\\n\\nHouse Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.\\n\\n\"The House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means Committees have unearthed a record of evidence revealing Joe Biden was ‘the brand’ his family sold to enrich the Bidens,\" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement Tuesday. \"Joe Biden knew of, participated in, and benefited from these schemes. Joe Biden attended dinners, spoke on speakerphone, showed up to meetings, and had coffee with his son’s foreign business associates.\\n\\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"In fact, we’ve documented how Joe Biden has met with nearly all of his son’s foreign business associates as they were collectively funneling millions to the Bidens. Our committees have the opportunity to depose Hunter Biden, a key witness in our impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden, about this record of evidence. This deposition is not the conclusion of the impeachment inquiry. There are more subpoenas and witness interviews to come.\"\\n\\nComer added that the committee will continue to investigate to \"determine whether articles of impeachment are warranted.\"',\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nFormer Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came to the defense of former President Trump in a Wall Street Journal op-ed slamming the recent New York civil fraud court case that ordered the 45th president to pay a $354.8 million fine plus interest.\\n\\n\"Every American has a right to be critical of Mr. Trump’s politics—one of us ran against him in 2016,\" reads Bush’s op-ed, titled, \"Elon Musk and Donald Trump Cases Imperil the Rule of Law.\"\\n\\n\"…But equality before the law is precious, and these rulings represent a crisis not only for the soundness of our courts, but for the business environment that has allowed the U.S. to prosper,\" the opinion piece continued. \"If these rulings stand, the damage could cascade through the economy, creating fear of arbitrary enforcement against entrepreneurs who seek public office or raise their voices as citizens in a way that politicians dislike.\"\\n\\nThe column, which was co-authored by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, railed against the recent monthslong civil fraud trial against Trump, which resulted in a nearly $355 million fine and bars Trump from operating his business in New York for three years. The opinion piece also spoke out against how a Delaware judge recently rescinded tech billionaire Elon Musk\\'s $56 billion compensation from Tesla.\\n\\nTRUMP BLASTS \\'CLUBHOUSE POLITICIAN\\' JUDGE AFTER BEING FINED $350M, DEFENDS THE \\'GREAT COMPANY\\' HE BUILT\\n\\nBush ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential election, when the two exchanged repeated barbs, including personal jabs such as Trump claiming Bush is an \"embarrassment to his family.\" In 2018, Bush said Trump is \"Republican in basically name only\" and took another apparent stab at the then-president, saying after he bowed out of the primary that he returned home where his children \"actually love me.\"\\n\\nFollowing Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, the former Florida governor said Trump \"provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol today.\"\\n\\n\"He has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection,\" Bush said in a post at the time. \"Mr. President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy.\"\\n\\nTRUMP BACKS GEORGE P. BUSH, JEB\\'S SON, IN TEXAS POLITICAL RACE\\n\\nThe op-ed marks a defense of Bush\\'s former 2016 rival, albeit not for Trump’s political stances. Instead, Lonsdale and Bush are calling for a \"dispassionate\" legal system that will not throttle businesses and lead to a weakened economy.\\n\\n\"\\u200b\\u200bNew York and Delaware have played an outsize role in business in the U.S.\" the pair wrote. \"Many major companies are incorporated in Delaware owing to the state’s body of corporate legal precedents; and a significant number of banks operate in New York, the world financial capital. The appellate courts in those states now have a chance to review these dangerous judicial rulings and try to stop further damage to the reputations of their respective judiciaries.\"\\n\\n\"If they don’t, blue-state politicians may have the satisfaction of ‘sticking it’ to Messrs. Trump and Musk, but the loss to those states will be significant,\" they continued. \"The damage to the legal fabric of the country will be even worse. A dispassionate justice system is at the heart of American exceptionalism, and the country will be poorer if we lose it.\"\\n\\nTrump has since appealed the ruling and repeatedly argued that the presiding judge, Arthur Engoron, and New York Attorney General Letitia James were politically motivated in the case.\\n\\nFORMER TRUMP RIVAL JEB BUSH CALLS MANHATTAN GRAND JURY INDICTMENT \\'VERY POLITICAL\\'\\n\\n\"A crooked New York judge working with the very corrupt attorney general of New York State, who ran on the basis of ‘I will get trump’ before knowing me — before even knowing anything about me — just ruled that I have to pay a fine of $355 million based on absolutely nothing,\" Trump told Fox News Digital after the fine was announced. \"No victims. No damages. Great financial statements, with full disclaimer clauses, only success.\"\\n\\nNEW YORK AG TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER TRUMP FRAUD RULING: \\'JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED\\'\\n\\nThe op-ed noted that when James was on the campaign trail for the attorney general position, she ran on a campaign \"promise to target the man she called \\'an illegitimate president.’\"\\n\\n\"The unusual New York law Ms. James used to investigate and sue Mr. Trump didn’t require her to prove that he had intended to defraud anyone, or even that anyone lost money. The Associated Press found that of the 12 cases brought under that law since its adoption in 1956 in which significant penalties were imposed, the case against Mr. Trump was the only instance without an alleged victim or financial loss,\" the pair wrote.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTrump attorneys had asked Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an \"orderly post-judgement process,\" which was denied Thursday afternoon.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.\\n\\nMcConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in the well of the Senate shortly after noon ET, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front-row seat afforded the party leaders.\\n\\n\"One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,\" he said in his floor speech. \"So I stand before you today... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.\"\\n\\nThe dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference with several likely candidates, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell\\'s handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\\n\\nMCCONNELL SAYS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS THE ‘BEST WAY FORWARD’\\n\\nMcConnell has also butted heads with former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner, who recently said at a Fox News town hall, \"I don\\'t know that I can work with [McConnell].\"\\n\\nThough the Kentucky Republican will not be GOP leader after this year, he intends to finish his current senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator\\'s health was not a factor in his decision. McConnell had a concussion after a fall last year and two public episodes when he appeared to freeze while addressing reporters.\\n\\n\"As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.\"\\n\\nLooking ahead to his departure, McConnell said it is time for \"the next generation\" to assume leadership in the Senate.\\n\\nTRUMP TEASES FIGHT WITH MCCONNELL IN FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: ‘I DON’T KNOW THAT I CAN WORK WITH HIM\\'\\n\\n\"There will be a new custodian of this great institution next year. As you know, I intend to turn the job over to a Republican majority leader,\" he said. \"I have full confidence in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.\"\\n\\nMcConnell became emotional as he spoke. Dozens of his staff members attended his speech and colleagues from both parties, many of whom were taken by surprise, gave him a standing ovation at the conclusion of his remarks.\\n\\nHis speech reflected on his long and storied career, and he somberly noted that the recent death of his wife\\'s youngest sister, Angela Chao, had prompted \"a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s God\\'s way of reminding you of your own life\\'s journey to re-prioritize the impact of the world that we all inevitably leave behind,\" McConnell said. \"I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions are closer than I\\'d prefer.\"\\n\\nMcConnell fondly recalled the beginning of his Senate career, when President Reagan once referred to him as \"Mitch O\\'Donnell\" on the campaign trail in Kentucky. At the time, in 1985, Kentucky was still a reliably blue state and McConnell was the first Republican to win a statewide election there in 16 years.\\n\\nREPUBLICAN RAGE AGAINST MCCONNELL RISES AFTER BORDER DEAL DEBACLE, UKRAINE FUNDING PUSH\\n\\nIn the decades since, McConnell has worked his way through leadership, serving as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senate majority whip and then leader in both the minority and majority. He embraced and fought for Reagan\\'s view of America as a leading superpower and defender of freedom globally, most recently emerging as the top Republican advocate in the Senate for additional aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nAs majority leader during Trump\\'s first term, McConnell left perhaps his most lasting legacy on the judiciary, confirming 162 district court judges to the federal bench.\\n\\nIn 2016, he played a major role in the Senate majority’s effort to deny President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a confirmation hearing for roughly eight months. The move allowed Trump to fill that vacated seat with Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Then, in 2020, McConnell helped spearhead the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the weeks before Election Day.\\n\\nThe move solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has since delivered landmark wins for conservatives on gun rights and overturning federal protections for abortion.\\n\\nThough hardliners would object to McConnell as too willing to concede to the Democrats\\' demands in government shutdown negotiations — and too critical of Trump — in leadership he has consistently opposed overreaching government regulation, tax hikes and increased government spending.\\n\\nOn the succession question, potential candidates may include one of McConnell\\'s lieutenants: Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; or John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\\n\\nFlorida Sen. Rick Scott had challenged McConnell for GOP leadership in 2022, but lost that leadership election 37-10.\\n\\nReacting to the announcement, several Republicans expressed gratitude for McConnell\\'s leadership and honored his decades-long career in government.\\n\\nRAND PAUL: KENTUCKY SO UPSET WITH MCCONNELL OVER UKRAINE AND BORDER, A TOP DEMOCRAT COULD WIN HIS SEAT\\n\\n\"Mitch has had a long and honorable tenure as the Republican leader. I am grateful for his service,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who had called on McConnell to step down earlier this month. \"He made the decision that it was time to step down as leader, and I certainly respect his judgment in that regard. He has many legacies, but none is more consequential than confirming hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary.\"\\n\\nNorth Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called McConnell \"a true legend of the U.S. Senate\" and praised his leadership on tax reform, the coronavirus response and support for Ukraine.\\n\\n\"He has stayed true to President Reagan\\'s principle of peace through strength as a stalwart supporter of NATO and Ukraine\\'s fight for freedom against Russian aggression. I will always be grateful for Mitch\\'s friendship, advice and steadfast leadership of our conference during unprecedented times,\" Tillis said. \"He leaves very big shoes to fill.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nOthers were less kind.\\n\\n\"I called on McConnell to step down over a year ago. This is good news,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. \"But why wait so long — we need new leadership now.\"\\n\\nFox News Digital\\'s Jamie Joseph, Liz Elkind, Julia Johnson and Michael Ruiz, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this report.',\n",

Fox News Digital first obtained the letter, which blasts the president for his border policies, and his reversal of those from the Trump administration, saying his actions have had \"devastating consequences,\" and demands immediate action.\\n\\nBIDEN WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER ON UGA CAMPUS: \\'PEOPLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE\\'\\n\\nThe University of Georgia Police Department arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra and charged him with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, UGA Police Chief Jeffrey L. Clark said during a news briefing Friday evening.\\n\\nThe suspect is not a U.S. citizen. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday confirmed that the Venezuelan national entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.\\n\\n\"Every parent, and every American is extremely shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Hope Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Woodstock, brutally murdered by illegal immigrant and Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra while jogging on the University of Georgia campus on February 22, 2024,\" Loudermilk and his colleagues wrote. \"Our prayers are with Laken’s family and friends as they begin to navigate this tremendously difficult time.\"\\n\\nTRUMP BLAMES \\'BIDEN\\'S BORDER INVASION\\' FOR LAKEN RILEY MURDER, VOWS \\'LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION\\' IF ELECTED\\n\\nThey added, \"Your inaction to resolve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the U.S. Southern border has directly led to her tragic death.\"\\n\\n\"Your disastrous border policies have turned every community into a border community and destroyed countless American families like Laken’s,\" they wrote.\\n\\nThe GOP lawmakers challenged Biden, saying he \"should not wait until your State of the Union address on March 7, 2024, to announce changes to immigration policy.\"\\n\\n\"The proliferation of deadly fentanyl, the increased threat of human trafficking by drug cartels, and the impacts illegal immigration has had on our nation’s cities – all must be immediately addressed,\" they wrote, adding that Biden should \"immediately revoke your harmful executive orders\" and \"issue new executive orders that regain full operational control of the U.S. southern border.\"\\n\\nBiden \"should empower ICE to remove the aliens who have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including those who fail to appear for their court date. You should issue a Statement of Administration Policy in support of H.R. 2, urge the Senate take up its consideration, and quickly sign and enact it,\" the lawmakers wrote.\\n\\n\"When you fail to secure operational control of our nation’s border, you should be fully transparent and accountable with both our nation’s governors and the American people,\" they wrote, urging Biden to reply to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s letter from this week demanding information on Ibarra.\\n\\nBIDEN, TRUMP TO MAKE US-MEXICO BORDER STOPS THURSDAY AS MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS ELECTION\\n\\n\"Mr. President, we must ensure justice for Laken, and that starts by securing the border,\" they continued. \"We will not waver in our effort to resist your administration’s failing policies that weaken our nation’s immigration law and national security.\"\\n\\nThe letter was signed by Loudermilk, along with Reps. A. Drew Ferguson IV, Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Austin Scott, Andrew Clyde, Mike Collins, Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Greene.\\n\\nLoudermilk told Fox News Digital that Riley’s murder \"has devastated our community, sending shockwaves across the state and the nation.\"\\n\\n\"President Biden’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at our southern border,\" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital. \"His unwillingness to act directly led to Laken’s tragic death.\"\\n\\n\"Laken Riley’s murder could have been prevented if our border was secure and illegal aliens weren’t flooding into our country,\" Greene said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Joe Biden, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the rest of the Biden adminisitration have blood on their hands.\"\\n\\nShe added, \"It’s past time to act.\"\\n\\nThe letter comes after the White House weighed in on the tragedy days after it transpired.\\n\\n\"We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Laken Hope Riley,\" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if they are found to be guilty. Given this is an active case, we would have to refer you to state law enforcement and ICE.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe demands also come just a day before President Biden is set to make a trip to the U.S. southern border. He is expected to travel to Brownsville, Texas, and is set to meet with U.S. Border Patrol agents and law enforcement.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Biden’s trip comes the same day as former President Trump’s. The 2024 GOP frontrunner is set to deliver a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.\\n\\nTrump also has blamed Biden’s border policies for the \"invasion\" that led to Riley’s death.\\n\\nFox News\\' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.',\n",

Mr. President, use your existing statutory authority and CLOSE THE BORDER!,\" he added.\\n\\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp posted a letter sent to President Biden on Saturday, \"demanding information\" on Ibarra\\'s immigration status and calling for a holistic approach to border safety.\\n\\n\"Joe Biden\\'s failed policies have turned every state into a border state, and I\\'m demanding information from him so we can protect our people when the federal government won’t!\" Kemp wrote in an X post.\\n\\nIn the letter, the Republican governor called Biden\\'s silence on illegal immigration statistics \"outrageous.\"\\n\\n\"Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,\" Kemp said. \"The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration\\'s failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.\"\\n\\n\"These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically [sic] address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley\\'s horrible fate is not replicated across the country,\" he said.\\n\\nGeorgia Republicans Rep.

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nFormer law firm partner and divorce attorney Terrance Bradley on Tuesday testified under oath regarding what he knew about Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosector Nathan Wade\\'s personal relationship. Bradley took the stand after Judge Scott McAfee determined Bradley couldn\\'t claim attorney-client privilege.\\n\\nBradley, when pressed under oath, said he couldn\\'t recall several details and timelines about conversations he had with former client Wade about Wade\\'s romantic relationship with Willis.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ashleigh Merchant at one point referenced text messages between her and Bradley in which she had asked Bradley if he thought the relationship started before Willis hired Wade in 2021. Bradley responded \"absolutely\" in the text exchange.\\n\\nWhen confronted with a record of those texts in court Tuesday, Bradley appeared to mutter \"dang.\" But then he said he was \"speculating\" in those comments.\\n\\nFANI WILLIS’ TESTIMONY WAS ‘BELLIGERENT’ AND COULD DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS\\n\\nAttorney Richard Rice later asked Bradley if he makes a habit of passing on \"lies about your friends.\"\\n\\n\"Do you tell lies about your friends? About a case of national importance?\" Rice asked.\\n\\n\"I could have had, I don\\'t know,\" Bradley responded.\\n\\nBradely said he couldn\\'t recall key details or specific information more than two dozen times in the roughly two-hour testimony in Fulton County Superior Court on Tuesday. He also said he had only ever discussed Wade\\'s relationship with Willis once with Wade.\\n\\nFULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS ACCUSED OF LYING ABOUT TIMING OF AFFAIR WITH TRUMP PROSECUTOR\\n\\nBradley this month avoided answering certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. McAfee said he would hold an \"in-camera\" meeting with Bradley to determine if his privilege assertions are accurate. He said it appeared that Bradley may have been misusing his attorney-client privilege.\\n\\nBradley is the former law firm partner of Wade, who is accused of having an affair that financially benefited Willis after she hired him to help prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Bradley said he hadn\\'t spoken to Wade in two years after having been friends for more than 10 years.\\n\\nBradley had refused to answer some of the questions asked by defense counsel about what he knew about Wade and Willis’ relationship and when he knew, citing attorney-client privilege. Bradley, for a brief time, was Wade’s lawyer during Wade\\'s divorce.\\n\\nMcAfee determined after the in-camera meeting that Bradley\\'s testimony was not covered by privilege, leading to Tuesday\\'s testimony, which is likely the last installment of evidentiary hearings before both sides present final arguments Friday.\\n\\nLawyers for Trump and his co-defendants who are accusing Willis of having had an \"improper\" affair with Wade will try to connect evidence that Willis and Wade lied about when their relationship began and should therefore be disqualified from the case.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Willis\\' father, John C. Floyd III, took the stand and confirmed what Willis testified to — that her father taught her to keep large amounts of cash on hand at all times. She said it was from these funds that she reimbursed Wade for luxury trips, which is why she had no record of the payments.\\n\\nFloyd also said he did not meet Wade until 2023 and that he was unaware his daughter had a romantic relationship with Wade until about seven weeks ago, when allegations of Willis’ impropriety were first made in court filings.\\n\\nDuring their romantic relationship, which ended last summer, Wade and Willis vacationed in wine country in California, the Caribbean and other destinations.\\n\\nMichael Roman, a GOP political operative and co-defendant in the Trump case, first alleged that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she benefited financially from hiring her lover. Four co-defendants have made similar accusations.\\n\\nThe crux of the defense\\'s case is whether it can prove with a money trail that Willis has a conflict of interest in the case against Trump and should thus be disqualified.\\n\\nGEORGIA DA FANI WILLIS WILL NOT TESTIFY FOR SECOND DAY ON \\'IMPROPER\\' AFFAIR WITH NATHAN WADE\\n\\nWillis testified that she reimbursed Wade for her share of vacation expenses in cash, but she and Wade testified there were no receipts for those transactions.\\n\\nThe defense, led by Merchant, is also trying to prove Willis and Wade were romantically involved prior to Wade’s employment in the DA’s office.\\n\\nBoth Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradicted testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former \"good friend\" of Willis and past employee at the DA\\'s office.\\n\\nYeartie said she had \"no doubt\" Willis and Wade\\'s relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.\\n\\nShe testified to observing Willis and Wade \"hugging\" and \"kissing\" and showing \"affection\" prior to November 2021 and that she had no doubt that the two were in a \"romantic\" relationship starting in 2019 and lasting until she and Willis last spoke in 2022.\\n\\nWillis dismissed Yeartie’s testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie a friend.\\n\\nThe highlight of the two-day proceeding was Willis’ own — and unexpected — testimony, which was described by one expert as \"belligerent.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nShe verbally sparred with lawyers for hours, at one point prompting the judge to threaten to strike her testimony. She also raised eyebrows by appearing to wear her dress backward. She did not return to the witness stand the following day.\\n\\nMcAfee said at the start of the proceedings this month that it’s \"clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.\"\\n\\nFox News Digital\\'s Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report.',\n",

Now that Hunter has put this partisan conspiracy to the lie that it is — on the record and under oath — this political charade should finally come to an end.\"\\n\\nHunter appeared on Capitol Hill for his closed-door deposition at the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees on Wednesday.\\n\\nHUNTER BIDEN TESTIFIES HE \\'DID NOT INVOLVE\\' HIS FATHER IN HIS BUSINESSES, CALLS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY \\'BASELESS\\'\\n\\nThe first son testified that he \"did not involve\" his father in his businesses, while blasting House Republicans for having \"hunted\" him in a \"partisan political pursuit\" and impeachment inquiry against his father. He also said Republicans have no evidence against his father, the president, \"because there isn\\'t any.\"\\n\\nComer, R-Ky., made a public statement Wednesday afternoon, saying that Hunter’s appearance \"was a great deposition for us.\"\\n\\nHunter, however, thought the deposition went well for him. On his way out of the hearing room Wednesday, he told reporters he thought the hearing went \"great.\"\\n\\nA source with direct knowledge of the deposition told Fox News Digital that Hunter \"first made clear in his opening statement and emphasized throughout the deposition, Joe Biden was not involved in, did not benefit from, and took no official actions to benefit any of his business ventures.\"\\n\\nRegarding the infamous \"10 held by H for the big guy?\" email, the source said Hunter told the committee that his associate who sent the message, James Gilliar, was \"out of his mind for even suggesting Joe Biden get involved in their joint venture.\"\\n\\n\"Hunter discussed his addiction at length,\" the source said, adding that Hunter \"admitted that he was high or drunk when he sent the ‘sitting here with my father’ WhatsApp message, sent it to the wrong recipient, and is now embarrassed by the message.\"\\n\\nThat text was sent to a business partner for Chinese energy firm CEFC.\\n\\nThe source said Hunter also testified that his dad \"was not sitting next to him.\"\\n\\nBut Comer said after the deposition that \"it proves several bits of our evidence that we\\'ve been conducting throughout this investigation.\"\\n\\nComer added that \"there are also some contradictory statements that I think need further review.\"\\n\\n\"So this impeachment inquiry will now go to the next phase, which will be a public hearing,\" Comer said.\\n\\nBIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIES\\n\\nComer stressed that Hunter and his attorney have \"demanded\" a public hearing following the deposition.\\n\\n\"Just as I said, when we said we were going to do the deposition first, we will have a public hearing next,\" he explained. \"So I think that the public hearing hopefully will clear up some discrepancies between some of the statements that were made between some of the associates and what we heard today.\"\\n\\nIndeed, Lowell said back in November 2023, \"Hunter is eager to have the opportunity, in a public forum and at the right time, to discuss these matters with the Committee.\"\\n\\nComer said \"all in all,\" he is \"very optimistic, very excited about this deposition.\"\\n\\n\"I look forward to releasing the transcripts as soon as both sides agree to that,\" Comer said, hinting that the first son’s transcript of his deposition could be released to the public by the end of the week. \"Hopefully that\\'ll be within the next two or three days.\"\\n\\nJOE BIDEN \\'ENABLED\\' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO \\'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,\\' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES\\n\\nDuring his opening statement Wednesday, obtained by Fox News, Hunter testified that he was present \"to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business.\"\\n\\n\"Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never,\" he stressed. \"You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any.\"\\n\\nThe first son said he hopes his testimony will \"put an end to this baseless and destructive political charade.\"\\n\\n\"You have wasted valuable time and resources attacking me and my family for your own political gain when you should be fixing the real problems in this country that desperately need your attention,\" he testified.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: GOP-LED COMMITTEES RELEASE INTERIM REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA PROBE\\n\\nHunter\\'s testimony comes after his uncle, President Biden\\'s younger brother James Biden, testified last week as part of the impeachment inquiry. James Biden testified that President Biden \"has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest\" in his business ventures.\\n\\nHouse Republicans have heard testimony from a number of the first son\\'s former business associates, like Tony Bobulinski, who testified before the committees earlier this month that Joe Biden was involved in the family\\'s business ventures. He also testified that he personally met with him.\\n\\nDays before Bobulinski\\'s testimony, another former business associate, Rob Walker, testified that Joe Biden met with the chairman of Chinese energy firm CEFC that his brother and son did business with.\\n\\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAfter Walker\\'s testimony, the House Oversight Committee said it was able to \"now confirm Joe Biden met with nearly every foreign national who funneled money to his son.\"\\n\\nHouse Democrats and the White House have criticized the inquiry as baseless, but Republicans insist they have just scratched the surface of the investigation into Biden family businesses.\\n\\nFox News\\' Chad Pergram and David Spunt contributed to this report.',\n",

If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal year 2024 will break last year\\'s record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.\\n\\nThe total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.\\n\\nThat is larger than the population of 36 U.S. states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\\n\\nMIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER\\n\\nCompared to the largest U.S. states, the 7.3 million number is about 18.7% of California\\'s population of 39 million; 23.9% of the state of Texas and its 31 million residents; 32.3% of the population of Florida; and 37.3% of New York. It\\'s more than half the size of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.\\n\\nWere the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. under President Biden gathered together to found a city, it would be the second-largest city in America after New York. And the total does not include an estimated additional 1.8 million known \"gotaways\" who evaded law enforcement, which would make it bigger than New York.\\n\\nTaken together, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, a record Biden\\'s critics assert could only be achieved by intentionally refusing to enforce the law.\\n\\n\"This unprecedented surge in illegal immigration isn\\'t an accident. It is the result of deliberate policy choices by the Biden administration,\" said Eric Ruark, Director of Research for Numbers USA, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration restrictions.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nMIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER\\'S ‘WARZONE’\\n\\nRepublicans and anti-illegal immigration activists have for years blamed Biden for allowing the current overwhelming surge of migrants by reversing former President Donald Trump\\'s border policies. The Biden administration has denied responsibility for the crisis and pointed to external \"push\" factors like violence and economic instability in South and Central America as the culprit responsible for vast waves of migration to the U.S.\\n\\nHowever, the president\\'s critics say migrants face more of a \"pull\" factor in the form of job opportunities and government benefits because they know they will not face deportation under Biden\\'s lenient policies.\\n\\n\"The administration has refused to enforce existing immigration law and taken every opportunity to aid and abet illegal border crossings — through policies such as catch-and-release, mass parole and offering temporary work permits to tens of thousands of foreigners who make dubious claims for asylum,\" Ruark told Fox News Digital. \"In actual effect, the United States government is completing the human smuggling and trafficking process for the Mexican cartels.\"\\n\\nIra Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said migrants have learned in the last three years that they won\\'t face deportation for entering the country illegally.\\n\\n\"They have sent the signal that if you come to the U.S. illegally, if you abuse the asylum system, you\\'ll be released into the country and allowed to remain here, in most cases given work authorization,\" Mehlman said. \"Even if you neglect to show up for your hearings, the odds of you being removed are negligible. The president claims he doesn\\'t have the authority to enforce our laws. He absolutely does. He is deliberately not enforcing those laws.\"\\n\\nLARGE MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING SHIFT TO ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, PIVOTING AWAY FROM TEXAS\\n\\nBiden has called on Congress to pass new laws he claims would let him solve the border crisis. He endorsed a bipartisan deal in the Senate that included an \"emergency border authority\" to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average. It would have also limited the window for people to apply for asylum, provided immediate work permits for asylum seekers and funded a massive increase in staffing at the border and more immigration judges.\\n\\nBut conservatives tanked the deal in the Senate after House Republicans declared it a non-starter. They argued the bill would have normalized record-high levels of illegal immigration and said Biden currently has all the authority he needs to reenact Trump\\'s policies and secure the border.\\n\\nWhile the debate rages, House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for allegedly refusing to enforce immigration laws. Two impeachment articles advanced against Mayorkas accused him of having \"refused to comply with Federal immigration laws\" and violating the \"public trust.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nDHS has criticized the effort as politically motivated and insisted the Biden administration is enforcing the laws on the books.\\n\\nBiden said that \"history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.\"\\n\\nFox News\\' Bill Melugin, Adam Shaw and Jamie Joseph contributed to this report.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Google Gemini, the tech giant’s new AI chatbot meant to rival ChatGPT, invented several fake reviews – which it attributed to real people – meant to discredit my 2020 book on political biases at Google and other big tech companies.\\n\\nOn Sunday, amid a sharp backlash against Google over its AI program’s apparent political biases, I asked Gemini to explain what my book was about. My book, \"The Manipulators: Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Big Tech\\'s War on Conservatives,\" was a multi-year project on Big Tech’s political biases that drew on inside sources, leaked documents and more.\\n\\nI was curious to see if Google\\'s AI program could be trusted to accurately describe an investigative book about Google, but I wasn\\'t prepared for just how misleading it would be.\\n\\nCHATGPT FALSELY ACCUSES JONATHAN TURLEY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, CONCOCTS FAKE WAPO STORY TO SUPPORT ALLEGATION\\n\\nGemini\\'s description of my book included this sentence: \"The book has been criticized for lacking concrete evidence and relying on anecdotal information.\"\\n\\nUnsure what it was referencing — I thought I would have remembered such criticisms of my own book – I followed up: \"Who has criticized the book for lacking concrete evidence, as you say?\" What came next floored me.\\n\\nGemini spat out summaries of four negative reviews, ostensibly from the Washington Free Beacon, The New York Times, The New York Times Book Review and Wired, including quotes from each:\\n\\n\"Book review by Matthew Continetti in The Washington Free Beacon: This review criticizes the book for relying on ‘anecdotal evidence’ and ‘cherry-picking examples’ to support its claims.\\n\\nBook review by Emily Bazelon in The New York Times Book Review: This review notes that the book \\'lacks a deep understanding of how these companies work\\' and relies on \\'unproven accusations.\\'\\n\\nArticle by Emily Dreyfuss in Wired: This article explores the ‘dearth of evidence’ for the book\\'s claims about Big Tech bias and highlights examples of cherry-picking.\\n\\nArticle by Ben Smith in The New York Times: This article discusses the book\\'s lack of rigorous research and its reliance on \\'unsubstantiated claims.\\'\"\\n\\nBut here’s the catch. None of those reviews were real. Not one. And neither were any of the quotes.\\n\\nThe Free Beacon did publish a review of my book, but unlike Gemini’s fake review, it was overwhelmingly positive, describing The Manipulators as an \"excellent\" and \"thoroughly-researched\" book that \"should leave any sensible reader, conservative or otherwise, outraged.\" (Not to mention that the Free Beacon review invented by Gemini was attributed to Matthew Continetti, whereas Charles Lehman wrote the real review.)\\n\\nI immediately asked Gemini for links to the reviews it cited – knowing they didn’t exist – at which point the chatbot clammed up: \"I do not have enough information about that person to help with your request. I am a large language model, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions, but my knowledge about this person is limited. Is there anything else I can do to help you with this request?\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTwo more efforts to get an explanation from the chatbot received the exact same answer.\\n\\nI reached out to Google for an explanation. A spokesperson apologized and offered the following statement: \"Gemini is built as a creativity and productivity tool, and it may not always be accurate or reliable. We’re continuing to quickly address instances in which the product isn’t responding appropriately.\"\\n\\nPeter J. Hasson is a senior politics editor at Fox News Digital',\n",

Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., announced Wednesday he will step away from leadership in November.\\n\\nMcConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced his decision in an emotional speech in the Senate shortly after noon.\\n\\n\"One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,\" he said. McConnell\\'s first Senate term started in 1985, under the late President Reagan, and McConnell remained a huge fan (despite Reagan at first calling him \"Mitch O\\'Donnell -- Close enough\"). But McConnell didn\\'t reminisce much.\\n\\n\"There\\'ll be plenty of time to express my gratitude and greater detail as I sprint towards the finish line, which is now in sight,\" he said.\\n\\nMcConnell\\'s dramatic decision, which will set up a leadership election in the GOP conference after the November election, comes as Republicans have expressed increasing discontent with McConnell\\'s handling of the bipartisan border bill and national security supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\\n\\nMcConnell has also butted heads with former President Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential front-runner, who said at a Fox News town hall recently: \"I don\\'t know that I can work with [McConnell].\"\\n\\nYet after McConnell\\'s announcement, gratitude poured in from both McConnell\\'s allies and his critics. \"I’m grateful for his service.... I think Mitch\\'s tenure has had many legacies. But no legacy is more consequential than the nomination and confirmation of hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary. And that is a lasting benefit to the American people for which I\\'m deeply grateful,\" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters.\\n\\nMcConnell said he intends to finish his current Senate term, which ends in January 2027. Sources familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital the senator\\'s health was not a factor in his decision.

       "    'text': 'Several potential successors are being eyed to fill outgoing Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\\'s role as the party faces growing division between more mainstream Republicans and a faction of hardline conservative members.\\n\\nAmong those who are being floated as a potential replacement for the leadership position are senators John Cornyn, R-Texas; John Thune, R-S.D.; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; Rick Scott R-Fla.; Tom Cotton, R-Ark.; and Steve Daines, R-Mont.\\n\\nMcConnell, who turned 82 last week, announced in a floor speech Wednesday he will step down from leadership in November. The Kentucky Republican is the Senate\\'s longest-serving party leader in history.\\n\\nSpeculation about Thune, Barrasso or Daines taking over as leader stems from their current roles in GOP leadership. They serve as Republican whip, Senate Republican Conference chairman and National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, respectively.\\n\\nMITCH MCCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS REPUBLICAN LEADER\\n\\n\"Chairman Daines is laser-focused on taking back the Senate majority,\" NRSC communications director Mike Berg told Fox News Digital.\\n\\nOne source familiar with Senate Republican conference discussions shared that the \"three Johns\" — Thune, Cornyn and Barrasso — are not of the same political stripe. Barrasso is considered the most conservative out of the three, the source said. Barrasso is also believed to be a more palatable option for the various factions of Republicans in the Senate who don\\'t always see eye to eye. He notably endorsed former President Trump early last month.\\n\\nSEN. COTTON PROBES DOD HOW US AIRMAN WHO LIT HIMSELF ON FIRE WAS \\'ALLOWED TO SERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY\\'\\n\\n\"What I\\'m focused on is the election,\" Barrasso told reporters shortly after McConnell\\'s announcement.\\n\\nAs for decisions regarding leadership, he said, \"I\\'m going to talk to members of the conference, hear what they have to say, listen to them in terms of what direction that they want to take with us.\"\\n\\nBoth Cornyn and Thune also endorsed Trump after Barrasso. Thune had initially endorsed fellow Sen. Tim Scott R-S.C., who ultimately dropped out and endorsed Trump.\\n\\nSen. Rick Scott was more pointed in his statement following McConnell\\'s surprise announcement, saying in a statement, \"I have been very clear and have long believed that we need new leadership in the Senate that represents our voters and the issues we were sent here to fight for.\"\\n\\nWhen Scott challenged McConnell for the position, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told reporters McConnell received 37 votes from conference members, while Scott received 10. One Republican voted \"present.\" Some of those who reportedly voted against McConnell were senators Josh Hawley, R-Mo; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Braun; Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\\n\\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who supported Scott in 2022, would welcome Scott\\'s leadership if he were to take over, a staffer in Lee\\'s office told Fox News Digital.\\n\\nMCCONNELL SAYS SENATE TRIAL FOR MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT IS THE \\'BEST WAY FORWARD\\'\\n\\nThe source also shared that Cotton was being mentioned as a potential contender for the position. Cotton\\'s office couldn\\'t immediately be reached for comment.\\n\\nCornyn, who does not hold a leadership position in the GOP and is poised to launch a potential bid for leader, said in a statement Wednesday that \"today is about Mitch McConnell.\"\\n\\n\"But I\\'ve made no secret about my intentions,\" he added.\\n\\nCornyn on his timeline: \"Not today.\"\\n\\nCornyn also endorsed former President Trump to be the Republican presidential nominee, and some lawmakers have begun looking to the likely GOP candidate for guidance about who should replace McConnell.\\n\\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told reporters Wednesday the next person \"absolutely\" needs to have a more positive relationship with Trump, adding, \"He\\'s going to be the next president, we have to work together.\"\\n\\nSen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., agreed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so important that the next leader have a very positive relationship with the president,\" Marshall told Fox News Digital in an interview Wednesday. \"I think that this next leader needs to have a little bit more, maybe a lot more of a populist view.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMarshall, who positioned himself alongside conservative hardliners who were critical of McConnell and voted against the bipartisan border deal in the national security supplemental package this month, added that the names being floated for leadership have been \"interviewing for the job since I got here.\"\\n\\n\"I watch how they vote. I watch what their priorities are. I\\'ve been watching their volume on what issues they\\'re championing,\" he said. \"All the names … have great qualities. They would do a fine job. But I\\'ve not even started a process of weeding them out. And I tell you, it\\'ll be one of the toughest decisions I\\'ve ever made.\"\\n\\nFox News\\' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.',\n",

Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho — argued that the regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are a \"de facto EV mandate\" phaseout of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. They addressed the letter to President Biden and Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, which is expected to soon finalize the regulations.\\n\\n\"President Biden has made his intentions clear,\" Feenstra said in a statement. \"He would rather force American families — who are already facing financial hardship under the weight of inflation spurred by trillions in wasteful government spending — to buy electric vehicles to advance his Green New Deal agenda than allow folks to choose the best car or truck for their families, businesses, and farms at an affordable price.\"\\n\\n\"This misguided decision also strengthens China while weakening our economy because the critical materials needed to manufacture electric vehicles are primarily sourced from China,\" the Iowa lawmaker added. \"Alongside Senator Mike Crapo, I’m proud to lead nearly 140 of my colleagues in urging President Biden to withdraw the proposed rule that would attempt to replace liquid fuels and combustion engines with unreliable and unaffordable electric vehicles.\"\\n\\nBIDEN ADMIN REPORTEDLY DOUBLING DOWN ON GAS CAR CRACKDOWN\\n\\nFeenstra added that stories of Americans stranded in the cold waiting for their EV to charge during the winter provided further evidence that mandating EVs nationwide is \"ridiculous.\"\\n\\nOverall, under the proposal, which EPA unveiled in April 2023, the White House projected that 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases would be electric by 2032. In addition, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck, 35% of short-haul freight tractor and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could also be electric by then.\\n\\nThe White House said at the time that the tailpipe emissions proposal, which represents the most aggressive proposal of its kind ever proposed, would \"accelerate the clean vehicle transition\" and reduce oil imports by 20 billion barrels.\\n\\n17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN\\'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH\\n\\nHowever, the proposal has faced widespread opposition from Republicans, as well as some Democrats and energy industry groups who say it will reduce consumer choice, lead to higher prices and benefit China, which dominates the EV battery supply chain. In December, the House voted 221-197, with five Democrats joining 216 Republicans, to pass a resolution nixing the EPA\\'s proposal, but that bill has yet to receive a Senate vote.\\n\\n\"The reality is that most Americans still prefer the internal combustion engine vehicle, and EPA’s proposed rule unnecessarily restricts consumer choice and forces expensive EVs onto Americans at a time when they can least afford it,\" Feenstra, Crapo and the other Republicans wrote in their letter on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Major U.S. automakers have recently lowered their targets and pulled back planned investments in EVs due to low consumer demand and struggling EV units,\" they continued. \"Further, automobile dealers across the country have said EVs continue to sit unpurchased on dealership lots, despite automakers accepting massive losses and unsustainable government incentives.\"\\n\\nLate last year, thousands of auto dealers nationwide, including dealers in all 50 states and who collectively sell every major car brand, called on Biden to rescind the EPA proposal. They warned that, while some consumers are happy with EVs, demand is not keeping pace with supply and their lots are filling up with unwanted EVs.\\n\\nVIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE\\'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: \\'DEFY COMMON SENSE\\'\\n\\nFurther, the Republicans argued the Biden administration\\'s proposal would make the U.S. more dependent on foreign supply chains, particularly those established in China. According to the International Energy Agency, China produces about 75% of all lithium-ion batteries and boasts 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% for anodes, two key parts of such batteries.\\n\\n\"Consequences of rules and regulations driven by the Biden Administration’s radical green agenda drastically reduce consumer choice and the affordability of vehicles available to Americans,\" said Crapo. \"Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable vehicles fueled by American-made energy products, not those primarily supplied by China.\"\\n\\nAccording to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents several major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrid, up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAt the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000.\\n\\nIn addition to Crapo, 23 other members of the Senate signed the letter, including Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Ranking Member John Barrasso, R-Wyo. Additionally, 113 House members signed the letter, including GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa.\\n\\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.',\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nA Manhattan jury in the civil corruption case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against the National Rifle Association (NRA) and its former CEO found the organization liable for financial mismanagement.\\n\\nThe jury determined Wayne LaPierre\\'s violations of his duties cost the NRA $5,400,000, but he had already repaid roughly $1 million to the organization.\\n\\nLaPierre was ordered to repay the group $4,351,231.\\n\\nThe New York jury said the NRA\\'s CEO for three decades misspent millions of dollars of the group’s money on luxury personal purchases.\\n\\nThe decision came at the end of five days of deliberations.\\n\\nNEW YORK AG OFFICE, EX-NRA OFFICIAL REACH SETTLEMENT DAYS BEFORE TRIAL AGAINST GUN ADVOCACY GROUP\\'S LEADERSHIP\\n\\nJames brought the lawsuit in 2020 and named the NRA, LaPierre, former CFO Wilson \"Woody\" Philips and general counsel John Frazer as defendants. The attorney general’s office argued the executives used millions in company funds on luxury personal purchases and trips, including hundreds of thousands of dollars on LaPierre’s trips to the Bahamas, according to the AG’s office.\\n\\nThe NRA, however, has long said the case was politically motivated by an attorney general who campaigned for the office by vowing to investigate and take on the group. James was elected to office in November 2018 and publicly slammed the NRA in the lead-up to her becoming New York’s chief law officer. While on the campaign trail, James called the group \"an organ of deadly propaganda\" and vowed to investigate whether the NRA could keep its charity status.\\n\\nNEW YORK AG CASE AGAINST NRA LEADER FACES TRIAL AFTER COURT AGAIN REJECTS GUN GROUP\\'S CLAIM OF POLITICAL PROBE\\n\\n\"The NRA is an organ of deadly propaganda masquerading as a charity for public good,\" James wrote in a campaign press release in July 2018. \"Its agenda is set by gun-makers who think arming teachers is a better idea than making it harder for kids to get military grade guns.\"\\n\\nWeeks before her election, she described the NRA as \"a terrorist organization\" in comments to Ebony magazine and \"a criminal enterprise\" in remarks to local New York media.\\n\\nIn August 2020, she filed a dissolution lawsuit aiming to break up the NRA over alleged corruption. A New York Supreme Court justice ultimately blocked James’ effort to dissolve the organization in a 2022 decision, saying the suit did not meet the requirements of ordering a \"corporate death penalty\" on the group. The judge did allow the suit against the NRA’s top officials to proceed. James accused officials at the NRA of \"years of illegal self-dealing\" that provided a \"lavish lifestyle.\"\\n\\nWAYNE LAPIERRE ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION AS NRA CHIEF\\n\\nAt the trial, which began last month, LaPierre and the three other defendants were accused by Assistant Attorney General Monica Connell of getting caught \"with their hands in the cookie jar\" and argued the four were trying to deflect and downplay the use of the funds.\\n\\n\"They\\'re going to try to get you to think about anything except what happened to those cookies,\" she said. \"They\\'re going to blame anyone else but themselves.\"\\n\\nState attorneys argued during the trial that LaPierre spent roughly $11 million in NRA funds on private flights and about $500,000 on a handful of trips to the Bahamas, as well as \"appearing to dole out lucrative no-show contracts to former employees in order to buy their silence and continued loyalty.\"\\n\\nNEW YORK AG CASE AGAINST NRA LEADER FACES TRIAL AFTER COURT AGAIN REJECTS GUN GROUP\\'S CLAIM OF POLITICAL PROBE\\n\\nLaPierre, who stepped down as NRA CEO and executive vice president last month after serving since 1991, said earlier in the trial he had made governance changes within the organization since 2021 and had paid about $300,000 back to the group. LaPierre’s attorney argued during the trial that the former NRA chief’s use of private flights was necessary for safety reasons due to his prominent national stature amid the acrimonious gun debate.\\n\\n\"This is a story made up by a person with an agenda that wanted him off the field,\" LaPierre’s attorney, Kent Correll, said Thursday in closing arguments.\\n\\n\"If this case was so important, why wouldn\\'t she be here?\" he added, referring to James’ absence from the courtroom Thursday.\\n\\nJUDGE ORDERS NEW YORK TO DOLE OUT NEARLY HALF A MILLION IN LEGAL FEES TO NRA AFTER SUPREME COURT VICTORY\\n\\nThe NRA’s legal team argued during the trial that the organization worked to address any potential corruption when such issues were first raised by internal complaints.\\n\\n\"When the fraud was discovered, it dug in. It turned over the rocks it was told not to overturn,\" attorney Sarah Rogers said. \"The NRA left no stone unturned.\"\\n\\n\"If this was a case about corruption,\"she added, \"it wasn\\'t by the NRA.\"\\n\\nIn a statement following the verdict, the NRA said the jury confirmed what \"they contended all along — that it was victimized by certain former vendors and ‘insiders’.\"\\n\\nNRA President Charles Cotton said that members should be \"heartened\" by the organization\\'s \"commitment to best practices.\"\\n\\n\"We appreciate the service of the jury and the opportunity to present evidence about the positive direction of the NRA today,\" Cotton said. \"NRA members should be heartened by the NRA’s commitment to best practices, and we will continue to amplify our compliance record in the pivotal next phase of these proceedings. To the extent there were control violations, they were acted upon immediately by the NRA Board beginning in summer 2018.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nNRA counsel William A. Brewer III maintained that the lawsuit was an \"unprecedented weaponization\" against the NRA to \"supress\" the organization.\\n\\n\"The NRA is eager to break the seal on facts surrounding an unprecedented weaponization of power against the NRA and its speech,\" Brewer said. \"There is little question former and current public officials were conspiring with Everytown and others to financially damage and politically suppress the NRA. Their actions harmed democracy and the rule of law – and letting relevant facts and documents remain secret does, too.\"',\n",

Please enter a valid email address.\\n\\nA judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in an extraordinary dissent to a motion related to the Biden administration’s rule limiting asylum, scorched the administration for what he called \"collusion\" with an immigration activist group to put the rule on ice.\\n\\nThe case involves the Biden administration’s \"Circumvention of Lawful Pathways\" rule, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced last year as Title 42 ended. The rule limits asylum claims, barring those who have crossed illegally and failed to claim asylum in a country through which they have already traveled.\\n\\nThe administration said it was a key part of its efforts to control the crisis at the border, but it was soon blocked by a lawsuit by a liberal activist group. The administration then appealed that decision. However, both sides filed an appeal to put it into abeyance pending discussions of a settlement.\\n\\n7.2M ENTERED THE US UNDER BIDEN ADMIN, AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN POPULATION OF 36 STATES\\n\\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal panel agreed, but Judge Lawrence VanDyke, a former President Trump appointee, dissented from the decision and tore into the administration’s decision to seek a settlement.\\n\\n\"For months, the rule was so important that ‘any interruption’ in its implementation, even for a short period of time, would incapacitate the executive’s border response. This panel made decisions based on those representations. Now, the government implies the rule isn’t so important after all. Indeed, the government is now ‘engaged in discussions’ that could result in the rule going away. What?\"\\n\\nHe said that the move from the Biden administration makes no sense as a legal move and suspects that politics are at play.\\n\\n\"At the very least it looks like the administration and its frenemies on the other side of this case are colluding to avoid playing their politically fraught game during an election year,\" he said.\\n\\nHe said that the administration looks like it is \"snatching defeat from the jaws of victory — purposely avoiding an ultimate win that would eventually come later this year, whether from this court or from the Supreme Court.\"\\n\\nHe also said that the government had given no indication of when the settlement abeyance would end, guessing that sometime after November might eventually be the plan.\\n\\nHe also suggested that the government may be trying to avoid an immigration loss in the courts amid ongoing concerns across the country about the border crisis.\\n\\n\"Placing these proceedings in abeyance avoids the possibility of a loss before the Ninth Circuit that could potentially exacerbate the issues at the border in the months leading up to the election — a loss made even more damaging given that it would be meted out by a panel comprised primarily of Democratic appointees, no less,\" he said.\\n\\nBIDEN ADMIN WEIGHS EXECUTIVE ACTION ON BORDER CRISIS, DRAWING FIRE FROM LEFT AND RIGHT\\n\\n\"The CNN headline practically writes itself: ‘Biden Immigration Enforcement Policy Struck Down by Two Clinton Appointees,’\" he quipped.\\n\\nHe also floated the idea that the administration \"may be seeking to create policy that resonates with its base while blaming the practical results of that policy on the courts.\"\\n\\n\"Up until now, we have been repeatedly assured that the rule is critical to the security of the border. But now, astoundingly, the government seeks to abandon its defense of the rule — or at least put that defense on ice until a more politically convenient time,\" he said. \"Whatever the parties’ real motivations are for seeking to stay this case, they haven’t provided us with a legally sufficient basis for their sudden change of course.\"\\n\\nFox News Digital reached out to the Biden administration and East Bay, the immigration group, for comment. In a statement, the Department of Justice said it, along with the Department of Homeland Security, is \"committed to defending and implementing the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule, which continues to play a critical role in reducing unlawful migration at the southern border.\\n\\n\"The abeyance maintains the status quo, keeping the rule in place despite the legal challenges to it,\" a spokesperson said.\\n\\nThe criticisms by Judge VanDyke could resurface in the coming weeks. The Biden administration is believed to be considering additional executive action, including an aggressive use of section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to stop illegal immigrants coming across the border.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nHowever, former President Trump attempted to use such a measure in 2018 and was blocked by the courts, a fate that could befall President Biden if he attempts a similar move in 2024.\\n\\n',\n",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. touting the apparent benefits of the Green New Deal ended up turning some attendees red with anger on Thursday.\\n\\nThe socialist lawmaker was speaking at an event in Queens in New York City where she was heckled by two attendees who accused her of caring more about illegal immigrants than those whom she was elected to represent. One of the hecklers, Jonathan David Rinaldi, said he is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for her congressional seat.\\n\\n\"My name is Jonathan David Rinaldi and I\\'m running for Congress against AOC, the Green New Deal is a scam,\" Rinaldi shouted as Ocasio-Cortez was championing environmental justice provisions and climate change policies under the deal.\\n\\nTHE GREEN NEW DEAL IS BACK, AND IT’S MORE RADICAL THAN EVER\\n\\n\"They’re giving the NYCHA apartments away, they’re giving illegal aliens $10,000 a day… I want you to debate me AOC, debate me.\"\\n\\nNYCHA, the New York City Housing Authority, is an agency that oversees the city’s public housing projects and Rinaldi told Fox News Digital he believes lawmakers are trying to move illegal immigrants into those developments at the expense of citizens.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez could be seen smiling on the stage as security tried to eject Rinaldi.\\n\\nAnother man then rose from his seat and joined in with the shouting.\\n\\n\"Secure the border now,\" the man barked at Ocasio-Cortez while waving his finger at her.\\n\\n\"You haven’t said one word about violent Venezuelan migrants, illegals.\"\\n\\n\"You don’t care, all you care about is illegal aliens and their votes. You don’t care about your constituents.\"\\n\\n\"That’s all you care about, you’re a disgrace.\"\\n\\nBIDEN\\'S GREEN ENERGY TAX BREAKS HURT AMERICA AND HELP CHINA\\n\\nThe man was soon drowned out by Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters shouting \"AOC, AOC,\" and clapping their hands.\\n\\nThe man was also making references to the vicious attack by migrants on the NYPD last month.\\n\\nAs Rinaldi was being led out of the venue, he shouted: \"Every single one of us is being sold out by people that have brought illegals here to vote.\"\\n\\nHe then clashed with an Ocasio-Cortez supporter before he turned and heckled at the congresswoman again.\\n\\n\"You only represent the illegal aliens.\"\\n\\nWell clearly I don\\'t, because I\\'m an elected member of Congress, so keep it pushing bro,\" Ocasio-Cortez snapped back.\\n\\nAfter the men were removed from the venue, Ocasio-Cortez then commented on her stance on immigration.\\n\\n\"Clearly, this community -- Astoria, Jackson Heights, also across the Bronx – clearly supports progressive immigration policies that welcomes all of our neighbors.\"\\n\\n\"We clearly support a path to citizenship, we clearly support ending draconian immigration policies and that is why you all… support my representation of our community in Congress because we have had enough.\"\\n\\nHer comments were met with applause and a woman shouted \"thank you.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"We have seen the voices that are anti-immigrant in this country are very very loud but they are very very few and we have to look around and realize how many of us are here in support of our neighbors and an acknowledgment of the fact that virtually all of us are descendants of immigrants, or indigenous people, or enslaved people,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\\n\\nThe hecklers were demonstrating illegal immigration and not all immigration.\\n\\nWhile illegal and legal migrants are prohibited from voting, the New York City Council passed legislation in 2021 that would have given non-citizens residing in the country for at least 30 days the right to vote.

       "    'text': 'There is growing frustration among the 11 House impeachment managers about when they will present their articles to the Senate in the case of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\\n\\nHouse managers serve as \"prosecutors\" and argue the impeachment case before the Senate.\\n\\nOne impeachment manager told Fox they had been given \"no clear guidance\" about the roles they might play or when the House may even transmit the articles to the Senate.\\n\\nFox was told the earliest the Senate could begin a trial is Wednesday. However, the decision lies at the feet of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).\\n\\nFox is told that it is extremely unlikely that an impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will begin this week.\\n\\nRANCHER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘ROUTE’ FOR TERROR AS MAYORKAS DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MASS BORDER CROSSINGS\\n\\nSeveral factors are at play. The Senate must be ready to receive the articles. And Fox is told that the worst-kept secret in Washington is that no one wants to start a trial until there is some resolution to averting a partial government shutdown this week and a full government shutdown next week.\\n\\nThat said, the Senate must at least start the trial at some point – even if Democrats move to dismiss the articles quickly and short circuit the trial.\\n\\nSome House impeachment managers have been grousing about having little information about when the trial may start or what their roles may be when they present their case to the Senate.\\n\\nA senior House leadership source says that the impeachment managers were given what was termed a \"comprehensive briefing\" last week and \"detailed\" portfolios about the articles and the House case against Mayorkas. Moreover, the managers were chosen because of their familiarity with the case against Mayorkas.\\n\\nDespite the carping, the House GOP leadership source says that \"we are confident (the managers) will be prepared.\"\\n\\nSome House Republicans – and some impeachment managers – are itching to get started, but that could backfire without preparation.\\n\\nFox was told two weeks ago that House impeachment managers believed they might meet late last week to prep and organize – even doing \"mock trial\" sessions. Democrats who were impeachment managers conducted such dry runs in late 2019 and early 2020 ahead of the first impeachment trial of former President Trump. However, such sessions never materialized, although there were conversations among chiefs of staff for the impeachment managers.\\n\\nHOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER BORDER CRISIS\\n\\n\"We hoped to get clarity on the next steps two weeks ago, if not the end of last week,\" said one frustrated manager.\\n\\nThere has been some chatter that the House might not even send over the impeachment articles until the issue of two looming government shutdowns subsides.\\n\\nManagers expressed concern about how they should prepare or if the managers would be assigned \"subject lanes\" to argue before the Senate.\\n\\nOne manager feared that House leaders might want to send over the articles promptly, initiating a trial without any preparation. The manager worried how that would look if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decides to give impeachment managers some latitude and present their arguments.\\n\\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"We might fall on our face,\" said one manager.',\n",

       "    'text': 'A Maryland county is promising to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after a \"productive\" meeting about it honoring ICE detainers lodged against criminal illegal immigrants – as the top ICE official in the state told Fox News Digital that hundreds of criminals have been released back onto the streets by the county in the last two years.\\n\\nMontgomery County officials met with ICE’s Baltimore Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to discuss cooperation on Tuesday. In a statement, county officials said there was a \"productive discussion\" between County Executive Marc Elrich and Baltimore Field Office Director Darius Reeves \"about improved communications and operational challenges with custody transfers.\" An ICE official told Fox News Digital that a dialogue had been opened on honoring detainers and they were looking forward to a mutually beneficial arrangement.\\n\\nICE lodges detainers against illegal immigrants who are brought into local police custody when ICE believes them to be deportable. Those detainers request that the police notify ICE when they are about to be released and sometimes hold them for a limited additional time so that ICE can take them safely into federal custody and act to remove them.\\n\\nSALVADORAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION TO MARYLAND MURDER OF 2-YEAR-OLD BOY\\n\\nHowever, \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions refuse to honor such detainers. Montgomery County claims it is not a sanctuary county, and that it works with ICE in their work on \"immigration and customs violations and drug and human trafficking.\" Elrich said on a press call on Wednesday that the county does honor some detainers when an illegal immigrant is convicted of violent crimes.\\n\\nDespite that claim, ICE says no detainers have been honored in the county in either the last fiscal year or this one. Director Reeves told Fox News Digital this week that in FY 2023, ICE issued 198 detainers, none of which were honored. So far in FY 2024, the agency has issued 119 detainers and none have been honored by the county.\\n\\nHOUSE HOMELAND GOP DEMANDS INFO FROM BIDEN ADMIN ON GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT\\n\\nHe said those included illegal immigrants with convictions for assault, robbery, illegal firearm possession, sex abuse of a minor, rape and other sex offenses. He also said there was at least one MS-13 gang member among those whom ICE had requested, but they had been rebuffed by the county.\\n\\nIn the state of Maryland as a whole, the agency arrested 152 sex offenders in FY23. He said the counties that do not honor detainers – which he said includes Montgomery County – account for 46% of at-large sex offender arrests.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, ICE told Fox 5 that a Salvadoran national charged this week with the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland had been arrested twice in Montgomery County and released both times despite ICE lodging a detainer. Elrich said his initial arrests were for theft and were not on the list of violent crimes that would have resulted in him being turned over to ICE.\\n\\nReeves says ICE will go into the community and locate many of those illegal aliens, and brought them into custody, but stressed that releasing them onto the streets poses a threat to both ICE agents and the public.\\n\\n\"Any at-large operation like that, it\\'s just an inherent risk and risk to the officer and risk to the subject of our arrest and it\\'s a risk to normal day-to-day citizens that happen upon the scene,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The most violent of folks potentially have weapons on them. You can have incidents where… they take off in their vehicles and crash into other folks. It\\'s just a whole host of issues that would not occur if the detainers were being honored. We could come to the jails and we can take them out of the jails in a safe environment and move them toward their immigration hearings.\"\\n\\nHe also stressed that it is not a major burden on state and local jurisdictions.\\n\\nVENEZUELAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST 14-YEAR-OLD IN VIRGINIA\\n\\n\"We\\'re not asking any of these jurisdictions that are unwilling to cooperate to hold anyone for us beyond the 48 hours after their state release. What we are asking is to have advance notice of 48 hours so we can have the resources made available to pick up these individuals and in a very safe manner,\" he said.\\n\\nIn 2021, the Biden administration implemented significantly narrowed ICE enforcement priorities, limiting ICE to recent border crossers, national security threats and public safety threats. So Reeves stressed that the illegal immigrants they are typically targeting are normally serious criminals.\\n\\n\"We are focused on egregious offenders, major public safety threats and, national security threats. We are not focused on the single mother, migrant mother who happens to steal diapers or formula from the local bodega to feed her children. We are interested in guns. We\\'re interested in sex trafficking, human trafficking, violence, rape, murderers, gangs. Those are the people that we\\'re concentrating on.\"\\n\\nIn its statement, the county said the meeting is one of a number of such meetings, and the two sides will be meeting again in the coming weeks.\\n\\n\"The County cleared up some misconceptions about our policy on immigration enforcement (ie Montgomery County is not a sanctuary county) and ICE underscored their need for more notice prior to releases,\" the statement said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"Director Reeves offered resources and training for our Department of Corrections staff and the County shared our policy on notification to allow ICE to provide feedback,\" the statement said.\\n\\nThe meeting comes as \"sanctuary\" policies have come into focus after a number of high-profile crimes have been committed by illegal aliens after they have been previously arrested and then turned back onto the streets despite an ICE detainer lodged against them. In New York City, one of the most high-profile sanctuary cities, Mayor Eric Adams said this week that sanctuary laws need to be modified to turn migrants who have committed felonies over to ICE.',\n",

It comes from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has already reported 961,537 border encounters in the current fiscal year, which runs from October through September. If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal 2024 will break last year\\'s record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of New Mexico, a border state.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe total number of southwest land border encounters since Biden assumed office in 2021 is 7,298,486, CBP data shows.\\n\\nWhite House officials did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital.\\n\\nDanielle Wallace and Bradford Betz of Fox News Digital contributed to this report.',\n",
